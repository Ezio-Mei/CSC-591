For any of the code to work, there are several paths to the data that need changing.
The code for the naive Bayes and NB with EM are both in the NB+EMCode notebook.
The code for SAT is in the SAT_Approach folder.
As discussed in the report, the modifications for the EM algorithm were both implemented. If interested:
- Change "lam" variable in NB+EMCode to adjust the weighting
- For multiple mixture components per class, run EMMultipleMixtureComponents and change "k_per_class" (note that this code does not output all the plots like the NB+EMCode notebook)
