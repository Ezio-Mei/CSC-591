  i believe apple has a patent on the region features of quickdraw  a mac clone would have to implement regions  this is why apples comment was that they believe it is not possible to make a mac clone without infringing on their patents  they may have other patents like this  apple has patented their implementation of regions which presumably includes the internal data structure which has never been officially documented by apple  apple cannot patent the concept of a region  im guessing that either nutek reverseengineered apples internal data structure for regions i dunno if this would hold up in court or they came up with their own data structure  if its the latter then they wont be able to draw pict files containing regions  besides pict files there arent many places where regions are stored on disk  quicktime movies perhaps  as long as the region isnt being stored on disk and transferred from a mac to a nutek clone or vice versa it doesnt matter if nutek uses a completely different internal data structure  i remember reading that apple also has a patent on their adb hardware and that the nutek clones would therefore be lacking an adb port  what other patents does apple have on the mac   joe schwartz       email xoracmrpiedu  or  xorclothoacmrpiedu mapinfo corp 000 broadway       these are my own opinions  any similarity to the troy ny 00000     opinions of mapinfo corporation is purely coincidental  
   my wife has one of these  i have not had much chance to fiddle with it but in comparison to our laserwriters with canon engines she complains that the print is too light for her taste  the difference is quite apparent even when the print setting on the select 000 is adjusted to the darkest possible level  i dont find it objectionable and indeed rather like it but be warned that some people dont care for it and it is considerably different   i recall that years ago there were lots of debates over writeblack vs writewhite engines when dealing with tex drivers  is something like that going on here

  i had asked everyone about problems installing a 0 meg simm and an 0 meg simm in my centris 000 but the folks at the local apple store called the folks in cupertino and found that you cant have simms of different speeds in one machine even if they are both fast enough  ie  my 00 ns 0 meg and 00ns 0 meg simms were incompatibable  just thought people might want to know jason  
  jbr0cbnewscbattcom josephabrownlee writes  could someone post a definitive answer about the vram configuration   for the  q000 and presumably the c000 and c000 as well  there seems to be a   lot of  confusion about this issue  id like to know           what kind of simms are the vram simms ie 00pin etc  theres only one physical size for vram simms unlike dram simms which  come in many many sizes and pinouts although they do come with  differing amounts of vram on them  the ones you need are 000kb simms are  organized as 000k x 00 and have two 000k x 0 vram chips on them  this is  the only size which the quadra and centris machines can use          how many vram simm slots are there  two          what rules if any must be followed in filling the slots eg in                  pairs sizes must match etc  both simm slots must be filled putting a simm in only one slot does  nothing for you          how fast must they be  00 ns for the q000 and c000 000 ns for the c000          is there any other relevant information  there are certain vram chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible  with the quadra and centris video hardware  make sure that the source you  get them from guarantees compatiblity  in general if it works in a q000 it will work in a q000   please dont reply unless you have the correct information  many   thanks in  advance for helping to eliminate some noise from this group  trust me     dale adams   apple computer inc

  as i said i know a multisession cdrom is necessary if you do more photos but what if it is just a writable cdrom drive and do a second session do you need one for that too  if you write a second time to a cd you need to have multisession capability to read the second session  whether it is photos or just data or whatever  here is a simplified way of looking at it the first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks  the second session has a newer directory structure but the first directory still exists because you cannot change only add  so if you put that in a normal drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data  multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc older systems look only for the directory not taking multiple directories into account  lex van sonderen philips interactive media  
  approximately four months ago i purchased a quantum 000lps hd from la cie for 000 after two months the drive started having problems first there were intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then silverlining 000 wouldnt even recognize the drive so i got an rma from la cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one  well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems often when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark sometimes if i then insert the silverlining 000 program i can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives at that point i can restart the iisi and boot from the hd ive called la cie again and theyve given me another rma their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesnt see the drive theres a definite hardware problem  given that this is the second bad drive in four months i asked la cie to send me a new one but they said no also within three weeks after i purchased my original drive la cie dropped the price on it by over 000  i can accept that a drive or two may be bad and i know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs and i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations nevertheless taken together the convergence of these factsevents have left a bad taste in my mouth i should have added above that when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will sendi think the data is still in good shape and ill have to again reinstall everything from floppiesthey said it would cost me 000 for data recovery  it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still covered under a 00day warranty should be new   i feel a little helpless about all this i dont mean to necessarily flame la cietheir support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful but cmon sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way i sent a letter to la cies customer service when the first drive was returned and i asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price i told them i would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another la cie product they didnt even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other  whats the moral of this story im not sure but i do know i wont buy any other products from la cie in the future  bill krauthammer f0ehg000umiamiirmiamiedu  ps please dont email or post about how good your la cie product and service has been im not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that all im saying is that ive had a disappointing experience with them and ill be taking my business elsewhere in the future

     there isnt any copyright equivalent of the res ipsa doctrine  but theres something kind of similar  to show infringement one  element you need to show is that the defendant copied from your work  if youre lucky youll have direct evidence of copying  the smoking  gun  normally you do this through circumstantial evidence by showing  evidence of access from which one might reasonably infer copying  this evidence of access is considered along with the similarities  between the two works in deciding whether you copied  however if  the similarities are so strong as to be striking an inference of  copying may be drawn even without any evidence that the defendant had  access to your copyrighted work    in that case the burden will be on the defendant to rebut the inference  of copying  for example evidence that hed been on a desert island for  the last ten years and had no contact with civilization    wow now we know why lawyers are rich and computer scientists are poor lawyers have to sound as if they understand this stuff

   my advisor has decided to get a mac for the lab now that we are funded again  the consensus in the lab was that all we really needed was an lciii but  he decided he wanted a centris 000  the lack of an fpu on that machine and the price struck me as making it worth less than an lciii so i have  suggested we get a iivx instead  it seems heavily expandable and for   what do people with iivxs think of them  they seem like good machines to me and i like the nubus slots in case we ultimately decide we want to do work with video on it  the iivxlciii performance at a centris 000 price the only reason to get an iivx is if you really need the fullsize nubus slots keep  in mind that the 000 supports all apple monitors and has optional ethernet this lessens but doesnt eliminate the need for nubus cards and unless youre running fpuintensive software the 000 will blow the doors off the lciii and the iivx the lciii on the other hand is sufficient for most people and has a great price  if you havent guessed i find halving the bus clock the iivx 00mhz up vs 00mhz bus a throughly bad thing and i hope apple never does it again    joe finete                                                                    jfinetecatsucscedu

   another thing why a scsi interface   because scsi works well with removable media and works well with large capacity devices the floppy interface you suggest handles the former but it doesnt have any hooks for dealing with the latter youd have to kludge it plus its extremely low performance and scsi has gobs of room for expansion compared with a floppy i can just see it lets stick a 000 a 00 a tape drive and a mo drive all on the floppy interface the possibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous   peter da silva                                             network management technologies incorporated               u  00000 west airport blvd  sugar land tx  00000  usa 0 000 000 0000                            zure otsoa besarkatu al duzu gaur

    whether the drive is hooked up to the computer or not the lps000 makes a disk seek noise every 00 seconds  this is consistent  and will continue as lomg as the drive is powered up  even if  i disconnect the drive from the computer this drive activity continues at 00 second intervals  someone tried to tell me the drive was doing a thermal recalibration  not knowing beans about the internal physical workings of the lastest disk drive technology i guess i might believe anything  whats the scoop on this standalone drive activity every 00 sec  i can only comment on thermal recalibration in general some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes basically the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance since when the media heats up or cools down some track drift is inevitable and the drive has to monitor it this becomes especially critical at very high recording densities and so was used primarily on very largecapacity mechanisms but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drives longterm reliability and mtbf ratings  i first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing say audio or video to hard disk some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are not to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes  hope this helps  victor

  well although this may be an uncommon occurrence or not i had a bad experience with techworks  this past summer i upgraded increased the memory in a powerbook and a ci   when i called to place the order for the pb ram i was told by the sales person that they would give me a 00 rebate if i would return the original ram which was also techworks ram  i followed the instructions for returning the old ram expecting to see a credit on my visa within a few weeks  well months went by and no credit  after many calls almost none of which were ever returned  arghhh i finally found someone who told me why we never received your old chips  i then explained i the procedure that i had followed to return them to which the person replied you mean you sent them us mail which i had per the original sales persons instructions  i was told that they their loss of us mail shipments is not uncommon come on and that i should have sent the stuff via fedex etc  i reasoned that i had done exactly what i had been told to but they would not budge the people i spoke with were absolutely no help  i sent letters copies of the original receipts attempted to trace the package through the us mail made many more phone calls to techworks all to no avail i wouldnt giveup because i was so disgusted salessupport people supervisors there was nothing i could do to pursuade them to make it right  i finally in total disgust wrote a letter to my credit card company asking them to investigate the problem   three weeks later the credit miraculously appeared on my statement  i have not in recent memory been so disgusted with the service that i received from a company  in all fairness they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off but i went to such great lengths to prove to them that this really happened  oh well cest la vie  i will never buy another product from them again  there  had to get that off my chest  
   could someone please post any info on these systems  thanks bob     robert novitskey  pursuing women is similar to banging ones head rrnpocwruedu    against a wallwith less opportunity for reward

   surprised shouldnt be  protective tarriffs almost always end up hurting the us in the long run  same with subsidies  they way to build a strong economy isnt to wall it off from the tough outside world but rather to compete in the global market place and dont come crying when the world doesnt always want to play by our house rules  tell that to the japanese their local market is neatly protected by the japanese government its one very tough nut to crack in fact the only current way to break into it is to do it with a japanese company as a partner in the venture   gary     gary snow uunetclarkgsnow  or  gsnowclarkedu

    first this is not an april 0 joke    a dealer in my town told me that the powerbook dont sell as they use to sell  the guy told me that apple is having the same problem it has when the desktop  mac was too expensive   the powerbook are too expensive in comparison to what  you can get on the dos side what do you think of this do you feel the same  thing about it just curious  sounds about right  if there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to aggresively cut prices  once the demand fall off a bit then is the time to start getting aggressive with pricing  waiting too long can really hurt your business though   the powerbooks have sold very well up to now if they are slowing down apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions the only reason i own a powerbook is that i could spring for a 000 pb000 the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me  id bet theyll be coming out with more power versions too    michael peirce         peirceoutpostsfbayorg   peirce software        suite 000 000 hibiscus place                          san jose california usa 00000   makers of             voice 000 0000000 fax 000 0000000              smoothie    applelink peirce  america online afc peirce  
  heres a question that may be simple enough to answer but has stumped myself and a few others  what does an external ram cache card do for you if you already have a large cache set through control panel in your simms  ex  i have a mac iici with 00 meg ram an external video card so i dont rob my simms and the default apple cache card i believe this is 00k  say i have my cache set at 0 meg what good does a measly 00k do me on the cache card  could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the simms  or does it still speed things up by providing a secondary staging area for data normally passed directly into the simm ram cache  im confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself  yet daystar fastcache has numbers which show around a 00 performance boost on some operations  are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most simm accesses  please help im trying to find the optimum memory settings for the iici system described in the ex above  patrick hurhfnalfnalgov  
   hello all i am thinking about buying an external monitor for my se00 and was wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me i am mostly thinking about a 00 color monitor and an 0 bit card that can switch between 000000 and something higher like 000000  i read an old report on a card from lapis that could do this but could not use the external monitor as the main screen with menubar which to me is a major draw back  has this perhaps been fixed or can any other cards do this like the micron xceed  also which monitor should i buy  at the moment i am leaning towards the sony 0000 0000s or 0000 what exactly is the difference between these but are there any other good cheap monitors i should know about  doesnt the monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions  please send me email and ill summarize  i would also greatly appreciate getting the email addresses of any mail order companys that sell monitors or cards  thanks in advance  eggert thorlacius university of iceland  
   i believe that in order to get at the innards of the new mouse you must remove the label on the bottom that says apple desktop bus mouse ii  there you should find two screws on either side i havent tried it myself yet but when i ran my fingernail accross the label these two divots appeared and i can only assume that these are the elusive screws in question  cheers john   john m graham the cleveland institute of music jmg00pocwruedu brought to you by the letters j m and g and the number 00

   a while ago i posted a note asking for specs on the quadra 000 and opinions on the q000 upgrade of a iici vs an accelerator card  so far no responsed that ive noticed  please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade paths  cost efficiency proscons etc thanks    complete q000 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent copy of macworld or macuser  my foggy memory suggests that the most relevant comparison factors visavis a iici are as follows    00 mhz 00000   00 mhz data path dont recall this for sure but its slower       than q 000 style machines for sure   ethertalk card onboard   audio inout   0 mb ram on motherboard   0 simm slots   0 nubus slots   more flexible buildin video than the ci  uses vram  in comparison a iici with an accelerator wont give you   audio or ethernet  or the same video options   with a 00000 accelerator cpu performance can be comparable but i   think it ends up costing more  greg dudek

  you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational prices   i would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices i went for a retailer actually mail order cda computers because its price was better thant the campus computer store i found out why later on when i tried to get a repair done at an apple registered repair center  the cpu was a resale the serial number had been removed and replaced with a nonstandard number probably from cda computers consequently the apple repair man could not do any warrenty repairs so i ended up with just a 00day warrenty from cda over the apple 00month warrenty boy was i pied moral of the story caveat emptor  however if you go with a reliable trustworthy mail order firm if they exist  maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences you will probably get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order out of state does not require sales tax yet though for how much longer remains to be seen the addition in sales tax on a cpu purchase will probably wipe out an educational discount again caveat emptor some mail order companies do include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state so check  richard    richard j appleyard  f0000000jaguarcscwsuedu  o o  washington state university        voice 000 0000000  fax 000 0000000   o  to err is human but to really screw things up takes a computer

   in the macuser article on the new centris and quadra machines mentioned that the c000 and the q000 and not the c000 had rom accelerated video  what is it  i dont recall seeing it in dale adams post  of course it was in dales post just not in the words that macuser  used  rom accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands has been rewritten inside the rom to take advantage of the 00000 addressing modes  commands that do fills should be slightly faster since the new instructions fetch 0 bytes at a time versus one

  in article c0iz0nkyvcsdalca hayesugcsdalca kevin b hayes writes you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational prices   i would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices i went for a retailer actually mail order cda computers because its price was better thant the campus computer store i found out why later on when i tried to get a repair done at an apple registered repair center  the cpu was a resale the serial number had been removed and replaced with a nonstandard number probably from cda computers consequently the apple repair man could not do any warrenty repairs so i ended up with just a 00day warrenty from cda over the apple 00month warrenty boy was i pied moral of the story caveat emptor   apple does not authorise sales through mail order  as a result mail order companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market  this market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have more machines than they can sell  they come into this state of affairs by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better wholsale price from apple  in either case they often obscure the serial nunber to protect their identity  as a result the warranty is void  you may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping  i should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer cost  as a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs and trimming margins  unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well  the lowest prices i have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest prices available from authorised local dealers  they are even further away from educational prices  erik speckman

  ive just completed a successful upgrade of a an si to 000 mhz im waiting on delivery of a 00 mhz clock for a final speed trial definitely needed the heatsink the cpu was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until i glued on a 00 cent radio shack sink   i made a call for reports of failures last week no reports have arrived here locally in seattle there is a reported cpu damage due to the user slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board  not exactly a problem due to the cpu running too fast  i think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system configurations including pds and nubus cards which were used id be happy to coordinate and report results  guy kuo guykuouwashingtonedu

  the trackbal on my pb000 no longer moves in the horizontal direction  when i called the nearest authorized apple service person i was told that it probably needed replacing and that would cost me over 000  ouch   can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem  one strange symptom of the problem is that when i take the ball out of the socket and shine a light into the hole i can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the wheel with my finger it works fine that way but wont work if i turn off the light  any suggestions or comments  ben roy just a poor college studentinternetbr0000aamericanedu   ben  since youre obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works the only thing short of repairing it that i can think of is a thorough cleaning of all the parts and then checking for the proper placement of the little blue rollers since they arent fixed in position on their stainless steel pins you might try sliding them into a slightly different position on my powerbook 000 i can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball in fact one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its edge contacts the ball not the center cylindrical area  ive done this with my pb000 and it does seem to improve the feel but needs to be adjusted from time to time i just popped open one of our offices pb000s and while there isnt as much latitude for movement one could still adjust the roller slightly if your pb000 is the same it might help  i would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller if you can take it out clean it with a mild soapy solution or isopropyl  alcohol also be sure the ball is greasefree  if you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin   if all this still doesnt solve it then maybe a new one is in order  it could be an electrical connection in which case replacement would be necessary but my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem not an electrical malfunction  hope this helps  murray      murray m altheim      ils ont lorteil de bouc  dun chevreil loreille instructional consultant    la corne dun chamois  la face vermeille csu sacramento          comme un rouge croissant  dancent toute nuict altheimmcsusedu       dedans un carrefour ou pres dune eau qui bruict

  i just recently bought a 0 mb ram card for my original mac portable  backlit and have since had some bizarre crashes it happens when i put  the machine to sleep and wake the machine up sometimes it will just  freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset  switch other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error  message of co processor not installed   i know one solution is not to put the machine to sleep but does anyone  have any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix  it the memory card is psuedostatic ram and goes into the pds slot that  probably figures into the problem the manufacturer is king memory not  kingston from irvine ca they say the problem is in my machine   any ideas  gene wright        genejackatakraidernet gene wright jackatakraidernet   000 0000000

  i havent seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac we would like to try it and i wonder if someone had some good advice  we have a mac iicx with the original internal quantum 00mb hard disk and an unusable floppy drive we also have a new spare connor 00mb disk which we would like to use the idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk but there seems to be some problems  the internal scsi cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk drive  if i made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each 0 for motherboard 0 for each of the 0 disks would it work  is the iicx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk  what about terminators i suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard but leave them installed in the other disk  the scsi id jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets id 0 the old one should have id 0  it is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive as we have an external floppy that we can use if it wont boot of the hard disk  thank you   torbjrn rognes                            email rogntorbidtunitno

  the internal hd in my lc disappeared for a day last week and id like to hear any reasonable theories folks can suggest for what happened  it is an lc with 00mb of ram and an 00mb internal drive running system 00 with a few scsi devices in a so far as i know properly terminated chain  i had shut down the system for a day i was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year and upon restarting got a blinking question mark  i booted from a floppy and saw that my external hd seemed okay but there was no sign of the internal  i installed a system folder on the external and was indeed able to boot from it  i tried things like disk first aid and silverlining to inquire about the internal drive  they either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it silverlining claimed it was a connor drive but it is a quantum   well id backed things up so i was able to work  but at some point i noticed that the internal had reappeared  now disk first aid says that alls well etc  things seem to be fine  but what happened  was this a warning that something the internal hd or something else is about to die  im definitely nervous  and if this is a signal that the internal hd is sick is it true that i can only put up to a 000mb drive inside an lc  some folks have claimed theres a limitation in the lc othern size or power while others and that includes lacie over the phone say anything that fits is okay  thanks for answers

  i hear that the performa 000 is really an lciii with an internal modem  can the modem part be obtained and installed in an lciii  it would be nice if it were actually a powerbook internal modem but that might be too much to hope for  i believe you were misinformed  i checked out one of the p000s at sears last week  the modem is external 0000bps data with sendonly fax

  doucetfsquadmnorg andrew geweke writes         i cannot speak for dale but i am quite sure that the macintosh  uses the full 00bit or 00bit data path to its full advantage that is  it is running as fast with two or four 00pin simms as it would with one  00pin simm now it may be that longword accesses assuming a 00bit  data path here get the first byte from the first simm the second byte  from the second and so on this would mean that each longword of memory  is actually split among four simms one for each byte on the other hand  it could be that the simms are interleaved by word or longword not just  by byte or they could be successive in memory and the memory  controller deals with the eightbit data path that each one has i  suspect though that they are interleaved to some extent so that 00 bits  can be read or written at once this would indicate a bytelevel  interleave         i am not confusing this with the new machines longword  interleave with two 00pin simms of the same sort although that seems to  be the same sort of idea there you get an essential 00bit data path ro  excuse me to ram instead of just a 00bit one yes the cpu cant  handle it but when writing to successive addresses it speeds something  up         so dale am i right 00pin simms are interleaved by bytes  allowing the full data bus or as is common with usenet and me in  particular am i as clueless as everyone else  what conclusion can be drawn from this  im trying to figure out what kind of memory configuration for the lc iii 00bit datapath would be fastest  any ideas  thanks jason macdonald   jason scott macdonald       jsm0cornelledu  jsm0crux0citcornelledu technology sufficiently advanced is          indistinguishable from magic                     cats exist so that we                   arthur c clarke                 may caress the lion

   hi what alternatives to the express modem do duo owners have if they want to go at least 0000 baud  every place in town says they are back ordered and part of the reason i want a laptop mac is so i can use it as a remote terminal from wherever i am but i really would hate to have to wait 0 months to get a modem in or have to settle with 0000 baud  thank you

  i have an old mac plus a couple of years ago i bought a shiney new lc it came with apples new keyboard with abd ports i replaced it with a macproplus extended keyboard which i thoroughly enjoy thank you very much   well i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but theres a little problem the plus uses an rj00 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards dont i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer theyre such nice people but they couldnt tell me the order of the wires   there are four wires in the adb cables black white red tan i know ones a ground one gets the serial signal one supplies 0 volts and i forgot what the fourth one does anyway if you hook them up wrong youll fry a board and i really dont want to do that   if any brave souls out there have done this before please email your experience directly to me i would greatly appreciate it especially since apples original keyboard is not    ergonomically correct   btw i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj00 jack and the adb since it has both but no such luck the connections are soldered inside of little boxes oh well      one more thing in case you are thinking that the abd ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus youre right however you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the macproplus keyboard via its own rj00 jack in other words this little engineering feat i wish to do is possible its merely a matter of finding out the correct order   omt when i get this to work i definitely will post the solution so others can too thanx for the input      tis the blink of an eye tis the draught of a breath           from the blossoms of health to the paleness of death          from the gilded saloon to the briar in the shroud             o why should the spirit of mortal be proud                                                                   william knox     shagbergvmcmpilstuedu                                       
  i too have been watching the iisi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in the next few weeks  the plan i have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel switch  this way i can get the speed when i want but i can also run at slower stock speeds it i experience any compatability problems with any applications  i dont expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running but if i can switch without any lockup problems then i could switch to 00mhz when needed and put it back to idle 00 mhz when not needeed  this would further reduce the wearandtear on the cpu even with a heat sink  of course i would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and route it directly to the mother board  i havent started probing around inside my si yet  does anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilators    thanks     tom dickens  boeing computer services  tpd0000yakcaboeingcom      these statements are mine and not boeings

  i am having trouble with scsi on a mac iifx the machine is 0 years old and i have been using the same hard drive internal maxtor lxt000s for two and a half years the disk recently crashed i reformatted silverlining 000 but during the reformat i received random write errors during testing the error message reported was like  sector 0 write error detected after testing good  sector not mapped out  this occurred randomly all over the hard disk which makes me suspect the diagnostics reference to sector 0   on the third reformat and after reinstalling the scsi readwrite loops i was able to get through passes 00 and 0 with no errors pass 0 for some reason reported a lot of errors but still mapped out no sectors i decided to go ahead and try to resinstall system 0 and reload my data from a backup this proceded normally however i now have suboptimal performance symptoms include     o frequent crashes    o instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to        correct    o instances of not finding the disk on the scsi chain on reboot         if i boot from norton utl after this occurs it cannot find the          disk either         the only thing that fixes this is recycling the power it sometimes          requires several attempts  questions     0 has anyone had this type of problem before    0 is the problem with the fx motherboard and its nonstandard       scsi implementation or with my maxtor disk is there some       diagnostic software that would help me make this determination    0 is it a termination problem i currently have external syquest       and an external dataframe xp00 on the chain the xp00 is at the       end and has internal termination so i am not using the iifx       terminator i do have the scsi filter installed on the internal       drive i have run with this exact steup for 0 00 years with       one previous disk crash requiring a reformat about a year ago       i also have symptoms if i disconnect the external devices       so i dont see how scsi termination would now be an issue of       course who knows   help would be much appreciated  forrest e lumpkin iii nasa ames research center lumpkincorvusarcnasagov  
  ig00fg00rzunikarlsruhede thomas koenig wrote    we are doing heavy  duty image processing with some seriously  underpowered macs mac iisi for example  most of the cpu time is  burned in doing ffts    what cards are out there which would allow us to take away that part  of the load from the cpu  any dsp 00000 or i000 cards out there  for example  theyd have to be callable from think pascal to  replace the one  and two  dimensional ffts routines in an already  existing program  check out the national instruments nbdsp0000 this uses the texas instruments tms000c00 chip which is a true 00 bit floating point dsp its pricey however

  its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a   vertical position  if the drive is formatted in a horizontal position it can   not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position    im not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 0 months from now but   why take that chance  if you want more detailed info on the problem please    i think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive on its side  the point is this will only be sure to work on the new drives namely 00 ht lps drives that have a smaller platter and are also more stable why should i take the chance  because ive been running a maxtor 00 ht 000 lps on both its side and flat for about a year and ive had no problems with it  period like i always say never trust the manufacturer  just like everything else in life the right lane ends in half a mile  ravi konchigeri mongooselelandstanfordedu

    xposted to compsysmachardware and miscconsumers   youve heard about apples great new customer support program  well think again  sometimes the only real support out there is what apple computer users can give to each other  for another example read on  in the march 00th issue of macweek ric ford described a twoyear effort by liam breck to document and bring to apples attention a problem with certain defective mice  at random the switches on these mice stick in the down position until clicked a second time apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in malaysia and have an fcc id of bcga00000 youll recognize this sticky button symptom immediately if you have such a mouse the problem is intermittent but its not subtle  liam breck recently gave up trying to document this problem and instead  suggested that people contact apples customer assistance center directly macweek 0000 p 00 when i called apple on march 00rd and described my defective mouse i was eventually given a case number f00y and told apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty  after waiting for three weeks i called back today wondering where my new mouse was this time i was told that apple had decided the serial number on my mouse mb00000fc00 is not within the undisclosed range apple is willing to replace and there is nothing i can do about it  nothing that is unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth apples while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice please if you have one of these mice i need your help dont assume you know what causes the problem there are lots of theories and start hacking around inside your hundreddollar mouse instead let apple do it please take five minutes to call apple right now at                    united states      00000000000                   canada             0000000000                   uk and europe      00000000000                   australia          0000000000                   japan and pacific  00000000000  if the number isnt tollfree call collect  describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse  even if they refuse insist that they register the details of your case including your mouses serial number  be firm  network managers and usergroup leaders especially please query your user bases everyone ask your friends and colleagues  please dont send mail to me or post yet another stickybutton report call apple directly  if enough victims take the trouble to report this wellknown problem apple will eventually be forced to respond  if apple continues to find it easy to stonewall on this issue dont expect them to offer support when the next potentially more serious mac defect is uncovered   bill sloan  
   hello all  for few past days ive been fighting to get my nec multisync 0d predecessor of 0fg to work properly with the internal video of mac iivi  with a vgaadapter as described in dale adams posting about quadra video it works only some minor interferences occur small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible  clear  but because the scanrates  stuff of 0d are well enough for emulating apple 00 rgb i first made an adapter then got one fron the local distributor of nec with both adapters i can get a picure which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then but with radical changes on screen opening palettes large windows etc there are major interferences in sync the picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally even when it is clear there are some spiky interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pulldowns etc with the selfmade adapter almost identical to the vga one only sense pins differ it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu with the adapter from nec everything is well most of the time but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost but not nearly as often as with the selfmade one  i know with self made adapters there can always be interference but with the one provided by nec wheres the source of this interference  ill give you the pinouts of the whole mess and i hope that you can at least someone please try  figure out what could be the best pin assignment for nec 0d i am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and isolations as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be arranged especially syncs and groundings  yes i have checked that the monitor is not defective it works perfectly well with all pc graphic adapters up to 0000x000 pixels and also atari 00hz monochrome which i am using now with it  here are the pinouts  stuff  00 pin mini dsub nec 0d00 pin dsub mac at least quadra  0  red video0  red gnd 0  green video0  red video 0  blue video0  composite sync 0  gnd0  sense 0 0  gnd0  green video 0  red gnd0  green gnd 0  green gnd0  sense 0 0  blue gnd0  nc 0  nc0  blue video 00 gnd00 sense 0 00 gnd00 csync  vsync gnd 00 nc00 vsync 00 hsync00 blue gnd 00 vsync00 hsync gnd 00 nc00 hsync shell gndshell gnd    connection suggested by apple for vgasvga sense pins changed to emulate apple 00 with multisync my selfmade adapter  multisync 00pin mini dsubmac 00pin dsub      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   00   00  00   00  00   00  00     0 sense0 grounded to 00 sync gnd   connection measured from an adapter to make nec 0fg0fg  emulate apple 00 adapter provided by nec representative  nec 00 mini   mac 00  0    0 0    0 0    0 0    shell gnd 0 0 0 00 0    same as above 0    same 0    same 0    same 00   same 00   same 00   0 00     not connected    well i am waiting for your solutions  and thanks   jartsu

  yes it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac iicx internally this is definitely not a recommended procedure by apple but i have done the equivalent to my cx after upgrading it to a quadra 000 the power supply is still the stock cxs and it was able to power two quantum lps drives a pli scsi  accelerator a micron technologies 00 bit video board daystar quickcache new technologies overdrive and 00 meg of ram simultaneously  i added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive tower the internal scsi cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto which i added an extra connector about midway the final hd was internally terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final hd had its terminator resistor packs removed cooling has not been a problem and no scsi problems occur with either the pli scsi chain or motherboard scsi hooked into the two internal hard drives  it works very well for me but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same   
  i have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 00 mhz clock and a higher speed clock oscillators outputs through a double throw switch to allow different  speeds there was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but if the si uses timing loops anything like a quadra for accessing its floppy drive dynamic switching will wreak havoc a quadra must reboot after having its clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its floppy drive

   when the computer is set for 000 colors and certain operations are done  particularly vertical scrolling through a window horizontal white lines  appear on the monitor which generally but not always spare open  windows  these lines accummulate as the operation is continued  if a  window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away  the line disappear from that area of the screen  this problem is not  observed if the monitor is configured for 00 colors or a 00 inch apple  monitor with 000 colors is used     i suspect a bad video ram chip but cannot be certain  the problem has  been apparent since day 0 but has gotten worse  im having exactly the same problem  again its fine when i switch to 00 colors or a smaller monitor  my configuration is  model centris 000 with 0 mb00 hd 000 vram no cards monitor mag mx00f with 00 monitor adaptor for resolution of 000000  i just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my new mag monitor  it seems to appear either when scrolling through a window or when using alpha or word and i enter return  my guess is bad vrams as well  i really hope it isnt a design flaw  is anyone at apple listening  pushpinder singh pushmediamitedu

  the duo powerbooks seem to park the heads after a few seconds of inactivity is that builtin into the drive logic or is it being programmed via software any way to tune the iddle timeout that makes the heads park themselves i think the heads are being parked since after a few seconds of inactivity you can hear the clunk of heads parking   denis

  according to the official documentation failure to use the iifx terminator can not only affect scsi bus performance but can also damage the bus whether this is your problem or not i dont know i have had sporadic scsi problems with my iifx since i bought it i cannot connect more than three devices fourth one causes major problems  first thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system if you continue to get errors it is probably the drive if it formats fine then i would try to format it on your system with no externals if this  fails then the scsi controller on your iifx needs repairreplacement  hope this helps     david c salmon salmonunomahaedu

  ive just installed a 000 tape backup in my c000 lot of the issues are the same  so to answer your questions    my pli 00m syquest drive has a wire from the  drive to an id switch on the outside of the case  where do i connect  this switch  can the computer just tell with internal drives  you probably want to hardwire the scsi id with shorting jumpers  put it at a convenient number like 0  you could cut a hole in the back of the machine to route the id switch but why go through the hassle  you probably wont be needing to frequently change the id of your internal drive  i noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard i didnt look closely but i seem to recall it laying over the ram thats soldered onto the motherboard  would that cause problems  yeah when i first installed the tape drive i was a little concerned too  but its no problem the device is designed to fit just fine with the overhang  it shouldnt reach back beyond the romramvram simms though  one last question  is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover   the drives front panel is smaller than the space left in the case the drives panel is the same size as the spotsbm clones cases  should i just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place  you can specialorder parts to mount the device from your local apple dealer  the relevant parts are    0000000  blank bezel faceplate   0000000  cdrom carrier ie generic 000 device mounting bracket  note apples unfortunate choice of name for the slidein bracket to mount a 000 device  the service techs i talked to said oh sure we stock those  of course they were thinking of the cd caddies to hold a cd disk when you stick it in the drive  as far as i can tell apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already cut out for a standard 000 device  why not  they advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the 000 bay why not provide the faceplate   they do sell a cutout for their cdrom drive of course but thats of no use  im going to hack up the extra bezel i ordered to make a cutout for my tape drive which is a standard 000 device  good luck with your syquest  fred

   i write i recently got a zyxel u0000e modem  its great but im still having some problems figuring out what strings to use in what applications i basically need strings for zterm firstclass client and telefinder client  ive been able to get firstclass and zterm working by using  another modems settings in firstclass and copying them for zterm however it still has problems  zterm for example will list error the first time i try dialing after starting the problem  if i cancel and try again it works fine  telefinder is even worse  i cant get it to even wake up the modem  so if anyone uses a zyxel for any of these programs id greatly appreciate you sending me the setup strings you use thanks in advance   yoshiocsuclaedu writes for zterm i initially did the following atz0 atd0 atw0 then i set my init string to atz0 thats it   rsmithpearltuftsedu rod smith writes i cant help you with firstclass or telefinder but ive been using zterm and a zyxel for close to two weeks now  heres what i did  once in zterm set hardware handshaking on and the bps rate to 00000 youve probably already done this  then i typed  atd0 atw  the first line sets the modem to ignore the dtr line necessary for hardware handshaking with most though not all mac hardware handshaking cables the second stores this setting in nonvolatile memory in the modem so its the default when the modem starts  in the modem preferences dialog i have the modem initialization string set to atz0m which just insures that the stored setting is used useful if starting zterm after using something like the fax software or macwoof which change the settings in other ways  alternatively you could leave the factory default the way it is and just set the zterm initialization string to atd0m which would accomplish the same thing if the modem is always on before you start zterm and if other programs dont modify the settings  or atz0d0m would work even if other programs modify the modems settings  i do it the way i do because i sometimes forget to turn on the modem before launching zterm and this way im assured of having the correct dtr handling when the modems powered up   after comparing the above strings with my at commands reference guide i came up with atz0l0n0x0d0s0000m this is entered in the initialize box on the modem preferences in zterm quick summary of each commmand z0 reset modem to user profile 0 l0 speaker volume at 0 fairly quiet n0 ring volume at 0 fairly quiet x0 display connect info according to setting 0 see manual d0 assume dtr computer is always on s0000 dial speed at 00 as fast as zyxel can handle  in firstclass i used this same string with the addition of s00 right before the s00 command in the setup box  this disables the autoanswer  function of the modem for firstclass  i based my modem setting on the supra 000fax and just changed the above mentioned string  in telefinder i based my setting on the zoom v00  hh setting  i changed the modem initialization string to the same one i used for firstclass and everything seems to work fine  sorry it took so long to get this summary out  if someone wants to forward this to the infomacreports directory at sumexaim it might save other newbie zyxel users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings and also save the net some redundant messages  if anyone else has something to add feel free  marcus mlobbiaucsdedu     marcus lobbia               mlobbiasdcc00ucsdedu    
  hi everyone just the other day i ordered a vram chip for my new lciii from mac connection they sent it overnight very nice and i got it installed and we found that it didnt work properly when you put the computer in  thousands mode the bottom of the screen using the new chip is all flickering and fuzzy so i called them up and im going to return it for a new one  my question is how often does such a thing happen with simm chips in general do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad is this a rarity this is the first chip ive ordered so i have no other experience in this area im just curious if anyone else has had the same type of experience  thats about it please email me and if people want i can post a summary thanks all   hillel sims    simshrpiedu    rensselaer polytechnic institute  is rot00 rotated 00 forward or backward anonymous  
  here is the story i have a network with 0 macs on localtalk one of them has an ethernet card and is currently connected to a next dont laugh i got it for the price of a mac iisi the next is connected to the internet over slip running on a 0000 baud modem  currently we can telnet from the mac w ethernet to the next and then telnet out again to the rest of the world  what we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that will route telnet sessions from the localtalk macs to the next via the ethernet mac from what we have heard air doesnt do the trick  software solutions would be good too but my impression is that there arent going to be any  our immediate interest is to be able to get to the next and telnet out again the slip connection doesnt allow us to assign ip numbers to machines so everyone shares that 0 numberoh well  thanks in advance    benjamin s chuangitdcss consultantuniversity of michigana0 benjaminchuangumccumichedu    consulting  referals here  bchuangcssitdumichedu         unix and long messages here

    hello  i remember running across an ad in the back of macuserworld a few years ago for a nubus board that had umpteen simm slots to be used to recycle your old simms when you upgraded memory  i dont remember who made this board and i havent seen it advertised in any of the latest mac magazines  it mentioned that it included software to make the simms on the board act like a ram disk as someone who has simms  he cant get rid ofuse but hates the waste this sounds to me like a majorly good idea  does anyone out there know what boardcompany im talking about   are they still in business or does anyone know where i can get a used one if they are no longer made  any help would be greatly appreciated  please email me to save netbandwidth   thanks  cap          internet cptnerddigexcom    aol cptnerd    compuserve 00000000      consilio manuque     otium cum dignitate     credo quia absurdum est         parturient montes nascetur ridiculus mus

  if you get teh iivx c000 upgrade does it include a new sticker to cover the iivx identifier with a centris 000 indetifier  i cant say for sure with the iivx  c000 upgrade but i wondered the same thing when i ordered my lc  lc iii upgrade  turns out the upgrade is actually an entire cpu minus any disk drives  you pull the floppy and hard drives out of the old one stick them in the new one and youve got an lc iii  the iivx  c000 may be the same thing  it might be something to look into for those people who are unhappy that apple only sells macs prepackaged with the drives  of course the price is quite a bit higher without the tradein  brian   cherkaueeerochesteredu

   hi there  does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c000 regarding fpu  in all mac price lists ive seen every c000 has the message fpu optional  i know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all c000 have the fpu built in except the 000 configuration  why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list im planning to buy the c000 0000cd pretty soon but im now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not why say optional if its built in please anybody help me understand this game  regards  thian

  hi all thanks to you all who have responded to my request for info on various kinds of fax modem id like to ask a few more questions 0  what are the advantages of buying a global village teleport gold over other cheaper brands like supra zoom etc 0  i heard that both supra and zoom use the same software why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems of supra  what kind of incompatibility is it 0  if i decided to buy the teleport gold is there any possibility to add a voice option in the near future 0  has anyone heard of a possible voice option that supra will offer this coming summer 0  a person did mention a new att modem  is it getting good reviews from various mac magazines 0  if i want the best fastest most economically sound and possible voice option what fax modem should i buy  sorry for posting so many questions but i think theyre necessary i promise to repost any answers if theyre not already posted by a responder  thanks so much in advance  regards  thian   since i repost this message again for the second time i hope to hear from some folks on this topic  please reply  regards  thian

  a professor of mine once said the difference between a computer engineer and a computer scientist is about 0000 meaning the engineer makes 0000 more than the cs seriously though the main difference is that most cs people write programs that people will use ie database graphics word processors etc while an engineer writes for machines or control systems ie the computer in your car a flight control system computer controled devices etc in other words cs writes software while cse writes firmware  these are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is  ps the 0000 is not just a joke scott  for the most part this is a bunch of bunk  ive got a computer engineering degree yet ive spent the last 0 years writing software that people actually use  moreover the salary distinctions are incorrect i received 0 job offers upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were 0000year lower  my advice is to decide which classes and projects most interest you and pick the major that allows you to take them  emt

  i just hooked up my mac iisi to a relatively old 0 year asante ensc adapter the 00baset connection works like a charm i installed the newest drivers from asantes ftp server  the problem begins when i attach one more device to the scsi chain  specifically a 00mb drive i power up the drive then the mac the mac tests memory etc just before the happy mac face normally shows up the power light on the ensc goes out and the boot process stops so i can use the network or the external drive but not both at once this makes the asante box pretty much unusable  it doesnt look like a purely electrical scsi problem because if i turn on the drive just a second or so too late so that it doesnt get noticed during the initial scsi polling the mac boots normally and the adapter works even though the hard disk is powered on and connected the mac has never once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now and ive had it for over a year  here is what i tried changing the scsi ids of the ensc and the disk  several permutations changing the order of devices ie the ensc at the head or tail of the chain overterminating with an external terminator both devices have internal ones underterminating ie removing internal resistors from the hard disk trying another ensc box trying another identical drive trying several different scsi cables  has anybody seen this more importantly does anyone have a solution thanks a lot    e    eric behr illinois state university mathematics department behrmathilstuedu   or   behrilstubitnet  please avoid

   i just bought a select 000 and rushed home to print  some grayscale pictures for my kids when i discovered that grayscaleand photograde are not available if you are using an seeven if you are running with an 000 cpu you wont see this in the printers docs and the apple rep didnt mention it to our users group either it seems that se roms wont support those features okay i  guess i should have somehow known that this was the case let the buyer beware huh apple be that as it may i have been thinking about the  problem and im puzzled why  cant a defencieny in the  rom be made up for in software i write software for a living on unix platforms and i dont understand the it just cant be done responses ive gotten from those i have asked so far  isnt mode00 or somesuch piece of  soft ware just such a fix  anyway i was hoping someone knowledgeable about mac internals could set me straight is it simply impossible for a mac se to print grayscale or could someone armed with enough info and a little pro gramming experience cook something up that would supplement the roms capabilities also how does one know if ones mac can support the grayscale and photograde that the select 000 is supposedly capable of  short of buying the printer and trying it out like i did thanks for your help   bill wright wgwnetcomcom   
  writes  afterall apples literature is not always 000 correct a funny one i  noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the macs with cd  capability refer to the auto inkjet feature this should have read auto  inject feature as it does on some other correct brochures ive seen from  apple since it was correct on some older brochures i can only guess  that someone edited the copy saw inject and thought it was a typo and  changed it to the more familiar word inkjet    hmmm what would that be a printer built into the cd player a way of  writing information to a cd    how do you think they get the cool images on the top serface of cds  anyway  they gotta have something to do the top surface artwork  
  its my understanding that when you format a magnetooptical disc 0 the formatting software installs a driver on the disc 0 if you insert the disc in a different drive then this driver is loaded into the computers memory and then controls the drive and 0 if this driver is incompatible with the drive then the disc can not be mounted andor properly readwritten is that correct  thanks jim frazier 000000000compuservecom  
     anyway i was hoping someone knowledgeable  about mac internals could set me straight is it simply  impossible for a mac se to print grayscale or could  someone armed with enough info and a little pro  gramming experience cook something up that would  supplement the roms capabilities  also how does one know if ones mac can  support the grayscale and photograde that the select 000  is supposedly capable of  short of buying the printer  and trying it out like i did  thanks for your help     bill wright  wgwnetcomcom   to use the grayscale features i believe you need a mac equipped with colour quickdraw i was told this somewhere or other but its not mentioned in apple facts guide for apple sellers in the press release or in the technical specs  sean

  some kind soul told me that i could change the serial port buffer size of zterm via resedit he did not tell me how i could change it using resedit and i have lost his email address  could he or any one else please tell me what to do  i assume that the relevant resource is zset but i do not know and i have no template for that resource if you have a tmpl for the correct resource i would be grateful to receive it that way i could play around a bit and maybe get my duo to do something useful with its serial port other than appletalk  btw i believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is 0000 bytes that that means increasing the buffer will help if you are using hardware handshaking i can cram text data pretty fast into my duo and can monitor that cts is being lowered but the buffer never gets beyond 0000 out of 0000 bytes makes sense to me  scott petrack petrackhaifasc0vnetibmcom

    so far i have only seen pictures of the new ergonomic keyboard  but it seems that the b is placed on the left part after the split  however when i learned typing in school some years ago i was taught  to write b with my right hand is this a difference between danish  and american typing or what    thanks a lot in advance    in germany you usually use the left hand for the b  yours frankie    frank probul emanuelstr 00 d0000 munich 00 germany  applelink probulfapplelinkapplecom internet  probulfinformatiktumuenchende  munich university of technology department of computer science germany   
     anyone know what would cause my iicx to not turn on when i hit the keyboard  switch  the one in the back of the machine doesnt work either  the only way i can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes  then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately  sometimes this doesnt even work for a long time  tj this problem is most likely the same that all cx users are experiencing thanks to one very adventurous usenet reader sorry i cant remember the guys name  somebody please post ithe deserves the credit for saving us all  it is easily fixed if it is the same problem   best i can figure it is due to time heat and repeated warmupcool downs in the power supplyie bad solder joints in the power supply circuit card  go get a desolder tool from radio shack a low wattage iron and some good nonacid solder and resolder the lower left quadrant of the circuit card with the ac plugs facing away from youor get someone to do it for you  it took me less then 00 minutes and saved me at least 000 for a new supply

  daniel salber salberimagfr writes  i have a question regarding quadras vram i have tried to find info on this but i could not get precise answers  on one hand we have a quadra 000 with a 00 monitor which is capable of 00bit color how much vram does it have      to display millions of colors on a 00 monitor you need 0mb of vram in the q000  on the other hand we have a quadra 000 with a 00 monitor which is capable of 0bit color only so it must have 000 ko of vram      correct this is the amount of onboard vram that the q000 comes with  i would like to take vram simms for the 000 and put them in the 000 so that both machines have 00bit color capability is it possible and if yes how many vram simms should i take from the 000      yes this is possible technically you only need to take out 0 of the vram simms but leaving in the other two will not get you anything because the 000 cannot really do anything with 00mb of vram it only knows 0mb and 0mb  from the documentation i have the quadra 000 must get 0 mo vram to have 00bit color is that correct      yes this is correct you get to 0mb by putting 0 000k vram simms into the vram simm slots on the q000s motherboard  bonus question where do vram simms hide from the 000 documentation they seem to be behind the power supply do i really have to take off the power supply to access the vram simms      yup you have to take off the power supply its only a couple of screws so you should be ok just make sure that everything is disconnected from it and watch out for static discharges

  ubscarsonuwashingtonedu university bookstore writes bunt0000studenttcumnedu monthian buntan0 writes   does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c000 regarding fpu  in all mac price lists ive seen every c000 has the message fpu optional  i know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all c000 have the fpu built in except the 000 configuration  why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list      i think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesnt have an fpu it does seem to be an option even though it really isnt  im planning to buy the c000 0000cd pretty soon but im now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not      well then allow me to end your confusion the c000 only come with an lc000 in the base 000 configuration if you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an fpu  why say optional if its built in      good question i have been wondering that since feb 00th  if you get the centris 000 with cd configuration you are getting a mac with a 00rc000 processor that has builtin math coprocessor support  my  understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing the centris 000 000 without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu       this is possible but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it what apple has done is given the buyer a choice between configurations and not an option  apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonfpu system to become an fpu system  and it is unclear whether the 000 processor on the nonfpu system a 00lc000 can be replaced with a 00rc000 supplied by another vendor      this is not unclear at all in fact apple has included in the roms of those machines with lc000s code to recognize the presence of the full 000s fpu and use it thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips you pop the lc000 out and pop in a full 000  apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris 000 which only comes with a nonfpu 00lc000 processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu  the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another again according to apples memo      they did i think i would doublecheck this it has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the centris hardware designers that the lc000 and the full 000 are pin compatible and that the c000 can be upgraded to a full 000  hades   
  davidanthonyguevaracupportalcom writes  sorry if this is a faq  i dont normally read compsysmachardware i am purchasing a couple of centris 000s  i configured the systems as follows  eight 0 mb ram ethernet 0 mb vram math coprocessor option  my purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent me the apple summary documentation to prove it  i ordered the coprocessor option but im really not sure that we needed it  i thought the 000 chip had a math coprocessor built into it  has apple had a math coprocessor chip architectured to keep up with the speed of the 000 chip in the centris 000 i am concerned that i may have set up a hardware bottleneck      apple has really confused people with this whole thing i think well be answering this question for about the next year or so there is no option to get an fpu on a c000 what you have is a choice of cpus there is the 00lc000 that does not have an integrated fpu like the full 000 and is only present in the base 000 model of the c000 appleusa and there is the full 000 which you get when you order anything other than the base 000 configuration therefore since you have ordered one of the 0mb versions with onboard ethernet models you will not be getting the lc000 but even if you wanted to have the lc000 you wouldnt be able to order a c000 with 0mb ram onboard ethernet and an lc000 its not an option     also a note to people out there that have 000 c000s and c000s thinking that there is an optional fpu the 000 class chip cannot recognize an external fpu so there is no socket on the motherboard for a fpu chip and you cannot go out and purchase an fpu on a pds card or something like that the only way to get an fpu in these machines is to replace the lc000 with a full 000 and if you have a c000 you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the lc000 with the full 000 but if you have a 000 c000 you do need to have a heat sink  hades

  hi  i am working on a project for my marketing class and id like to ask your help  the assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it  technical issues are not terribly important at this point  well my groups plan is to market a full page monitor for laptop computers  it would be a thirdparty product to be installed by authorized repair centers like newer technologys palettebook screen  the idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen remember technical issues aside  in fact by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration you could have regular or full height  the screen would probably be monochrome the motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people  business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document  because of the target users and applications color screens arent really a neccessity  we could hopefully keep the cost between 0000 and 0000  now please dont write this off as completely ridiculous  i really need some constructive feedback  so if you would please reply to me via email and let me know 0 if you would consider buying a full page laptop screen 0 how much you would be willing to pay for it 0 any helpful commentaries on the idea  also if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it doubtful but who knows please send me some  thanks in advance  mike

  were about ready to take a bold step into the 00s around here by accelerating our rather large collection of stock macplus computers yes indeed difficult to comprehend why anyone would want to accelerate a macplus but thats another story suffuce it to say we can get accelerators easier than new machines hey i dont make the rules  anyway on to the purpose of this post im looking for info on macplus acelerators  so far ive found some lit on the novy accelerator and the micrmac multispeed accelartor both look acceptable but i would like to hear from anyone who has tried these  also if someone would recommend another accelerator for the macplus id like to hear about it  thanks for any time and effort you expend on this  karl  
  is there a fix for this we have a quadra 000 that will not finish startup unless there is a monitor connected this would be no problem but since were running it as a file server there is no need to have a monitor connected all the time     horsefeathers shawn fitzgerald     umcc u of m computing club   michigan chungkuoumccumichedu  whether you are quiet and alive or quiet and dead makes no difference to cerebus  
   
   a question in general about displaying ntsc through a mac  if i understand correctly the video spigot can display ntsc in a small window as well as capture the data in quicktime format  however if i want to use a larger window what are my options perhaps i misunderstood the video spigot review    also i am not interested in quicktime  i would merely like to use my mac as a television from time to time  i have a nice sony 0000 monitor and i would like to use it as a second tv when my wife is watching sitcoms on our regular tv    perhaps some of the video cards for the mac accept ntsc input i have a iisi and i am willing to buy a nubus adapter  thanks in advance for any help  george micahels

   i have an se00 with a 00 meg hd which dates back to april 0000  when i originally purchased it i experienced the failure to boot problem  this was fixed soon after by a rom upgrade on the hard drive  lately a similar problem has been occuring  when the computer is powered on the hd light flashes a few times and then i am given the no disk to boot from icon  however upon turing the computer off and on again the drive always boots up just fine   furthermore if instead of turning the power on and off i press the reboot  button the same problem occurs  but as i said turning the power off and on always works  this problem is different from the 0000 boot problem in that before it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot  does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how it can be fixed  im wondering if its getting old and requires more time to  come up to speed now  is there a pram or scsi setting that allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before  trying to access the hd  thanks   altan j stalker astalkernickelucsindianaedu indiana university computer science dept

  dpbsdchemw0ucsdedu writes hi  i think i have a problem with the stereo sound output on my quadra 000 but i am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem on his powerbook 000  any info or experience anyopne has would be greatly appreciated  when i hook my quadra up to my home stereo system the following types of sounds mono as far as i can tell all play fine through both speakers  system beeps  already provided ones such as indigo and ones i record  armor alley spectre spaceward ho   but the following games only play out of the left channel  lemmings out of this world  awesome game btw glider 00 oids   but still stereo system beeps do play in stereo through both speakers the one im specifically referrring to is apocolyptic beginning which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site sumex   all of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 000 he cant run ootw because he doesnt have color  were both running system 00    does anyone with lemmings or the other three games i mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a mac ii class quadra lc powerbook 000 or greater centris se00 etc stereo machine  i used to have a mac ii and i sort of rememeber lemmings playing in stereo on that machine not just on the left channel  i could be mistaken though  if there were a problem with the quad 000s and pb 000s i am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo  if there isnt a problem with our machines i wonder why the 0 games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers  like spectre etc do  quadra 000s and powerbook 000s have the same roms to my knowledge so maybe this is a rom problem  if so though why wouldnt system 00 patch over this problem     thanks for any help you can provide  d00jwahemulnadakthse writes mac sound hardware is diverse some macs play in stereo and mix the output the se00 for instance while others play in stereo but only has the left channel for the speaker while some are truly mono like the lc  developers know that stuff played in the left channel is guaranteed to be heard while the right channel isnt some send data to both some only send data to the left channel the first is preferrable of course  okay i guess its time for a quick explanation of mac sound  the original documentation for the sound hardware im0 documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware  basically you jam values into all the even bytes from soundbase to soundbase0x000 this was because of how the mac 000 and some later machines generated sound was by scanning this block and daing every even byte the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines  when the mac ii and apple sound chip was invented it was designed to generate stereo sound it was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented so storing bytes at the even values at soundbase meant i want to play a mono sound and so it was emulated but apple had since retracted the documentation on soundbase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation so apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound  enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games furthermore people who port from the ibm dont want to learn more apis so it has become popular for game writers to write to soundbase to make sound since it is very easy  since the mac ii apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware and the only things they have in common are that writing to soundbase works on some hardware mac ii iix iicx iici at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound through both speakers on some macs quadra 000000000 at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound on the left channel only both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons  if developers use the sound manager and i think the sound driver mono sounds will typically come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware it is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only but no one does if developers write to sound base their games will only come out the left on some games  the other problem the original mac ii only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker while the se00 mixes both isnt really related it is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines it only affects true stereo sounds sounds which are actually mono will play on the internal speaker no matter what machine you have  now to more directly address the question the games you list lemmings out of this world  awesome game btw glider 00 oids and also hellcats super tetris oxyd and many more these are just what ive tested  cheat and write to soundbase and so are only left channel on quadras   other games you list armor alley spectre spaceward ho and also pga tour golf civilization and more these are again only from personal experience  use the sound manager and work fine on all machines  the more of the story is to developers dont cheat really i am absolutely positively not allowed to do what i am about to do but im going say it anyway stop cheating on sound really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware the grace period is about to end the sound manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will work even better soon so use it  in conclusion to doug it isnt a hardware problem at least not a bug to jon it isnt a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels if they do it the right way it is taken care of automatically if you cheat there is not way to make it work on all hardware   have fun  disclaimer number 0 i dont work on sound here at apple im just pretty well informed so dont write me with sound questions  disclaimer number 0 if it says up above that i wrote anything like the grace period is about to end then it is a bug in your news feed since i am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that you know what i mean  disclaimer number 0 i dont speak for apple just me  steve bollinger

  the subject says what i would like to do here are the details  i have a 000ke with the macrescue upgrade board that makes it the equivalent of a plus system 0 and macenvy both identify it as such  the macrescue board clips onto the 00000 on the mb  it also has a 00000 itself  periodically i have to remove the clip not an entirely easy thing to do and clean the legs of the 00000 larry pinas book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with snap on upgrades  the 00000s legs will oxidize causing  unusual system errors  well thats me  so i would like to do something permanent and i think it would be fairly easy to put a socket in where the 00000 currently is and modify the macrescue board to plug in  what im not 000 sure of is whether it will work  it seems to me that the two 00000s arent acting independently so removing one shouldnt have any effect on the performance of my mac  im about 00 sure  will someone provide the extra 0  erik erikcheshireoxyedu   
  i remember someone mention about a 000meg syquest  has anyone else heard anything about this  id be interested in the cost per megabyte and the approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the bernoulli 000

    the quadra 000 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware reads pram obtains all info from last session including the volume setting and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound and waits on the scsi controller to respond to the boot up code   if the dram produces an error or a registers cannot be read from a device or the device corrupts that addressdata or control paths then if it is possible the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the  sad mac sound   this is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac if you cannot control the volume of the quadra even at boot up then i feel there is something incorrect with the logic board   my quadra 000 does not show the problems you are having   steve h

  well folks my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after starting life as a 000k way back in 0000  sooo im in the market for a new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be  im looking into picking up a powerbook 000 or maybe 000 and have a bunch of questions that hopefully somebody can answer   does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook introductions are expected  id heard the 000c was supposed to make an appearence this summer but havent heard anymore on it  and since i dont have access to macleak i was wondering if anybody out there had more info   has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the ones the duos just went through recently   whats the impression of the display on the 000  i could probably swing a 000 if i got the 00mb disk rather than the 000 but i dont really have a feel for how much better the display is yea it looks great in the store but is that all wow or is it really that good  could i solicit some opinions of people who use the 000 and 000 daytoday on if its worth taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display  i realize this is a real subjective question but ive only played around with the machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful   how well does hellcats perform    thanks a bunch in advance for any info  if you could email ill post a summary news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the corner    tom willis    twillisecnpurdueedu        purdue electrical engineering  convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies   f w nietzsche  
   i would like more info on this if anybody has it our exabyte  0000 tapedrive has never been working from the quadra 000  we have been trying it since september 0000 replaced cabling  inits i dont know what all all the industry experts we  phoned the tapedrive dealer our apple dealer the software  dealer all say its our fault or they dont know the last  thing they said was that we needed a special quadra scsi terminator   anybody know more thanks  mark h nodine wrote    in article c0l00p0qznewsudeledu johnstonmeudeledu bill johnston writes   in article 0000apr000000000000mintakalcsmitedu nodinelcsmitedu mark h nodine writes   i dont know about the specific problem mentioned in your   message but i definitely had scsi problems between my   q000 and my venerable jasmine megadrive 00 cartridge   drives  my solution was to get silverlining  none of   the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives   in fact the only loop that worked was the macintosh   software loop whatever that means      i doubt this is a quadraspecific problem  i had to get   rid of my venerable bernoulli 00 last year with enough    cartridges purchased at 00 each to make the whole thing    worth more than my whole computer   the tech support guys   at ocean microsystems suggested that some thirdparty drivers    might fix the problem  in my case the cartridges wouldnt    formatmountpartition for aux      all i know is that the megadrives worked perfectly on both my  mac plus and my powerbook 000  it was for this reason i assumed  the problem had something to do with the quadra  even with the  quadra they mostly worked ok  the problem occurred when i ejected  a cartridge from a drive it would start popping up dialog boxes  saying this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware  even though there was no cartridge in the drive    mark  i have been using the pli sony 00 mo drive and now a sharp color scanner using standard scsi cables and standard 00 terminator on my q000  no problems  if you were using a iifx that might be another story  make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end  some boxes have internal terminators some can be switched out and others are socketted  these count  if the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling they have to be disabled ie switched out or pulled out of their sockets  if you have 0 boxes with internal terminations the terminations in one box has to be disabled etc  i am sure that this has been covered by the experts  my experience with scsi boxes that connect to the mac indicates that they must have some software package for the mac to talk to them  my pli mo drive and sharp scanner has one for each  good luck  art beattie  i only speak for myself   
  ha all this talk about changing the clock speed of the q000 makes me ask  if i replaced the 0mhz 00000 in my plus with a 00mhz 00000 with a 00mhz clock occilater of its own not shared by the rest of the mac just the new 00mhz00000  would my mac work and if it would work would you think there where be any problems with sound vidioscsi  it seems like a simple solution to keepa dead slow mechine a live a little longer    oh if this would not work any idears on how to make it work thanks   alex  arp0000ritvaxiscritedu    
    0    i have an old jasmine drive which i cannot use with my new system  my understanding is that i have to upsate the driver with a more modern one in order to gain compatability with system 000  does anyone know of an inexpensive program to do this   i have seen formatters for 00 buit have no idea if they will work   0     i have another ancient device this one a tape drive for which the back utility freezes the system if i try to use it  the drive is a jasmine direct tape bought used for 000 w 0 tapes techmar mechanism  essentially i have the same question as above anyone know of an inexpensive beckup utility i can use with system 000   all help and advice appriciated   
  question for those familiar with quadra vram  i put 0 000k vram simms in my quadra 000 in the 0 slots closest to the ram simm slots and i got no results whatsoever  i have been told that the builtin video should support at least 00bit and maybe 00bit color on a macintosh color display  however the monitors control panel still lists 0bit 000 colors as the highest possible  does it make any difference which slots you put the simms in do you have to do something to activate them do you have to do something to the monitors control panel  btw i am running system 00 with 0 megs of ram    charles p cox jr computer engineering case western reserve university cpc0pocwruedu coxsnowhiteeeapcwruedu

  i remember someone mention about a 000meg syquest  has anyone else heard anything about this  id be interested in the cost per megabyte and the approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the bernoulli 000  i think you must be talking about the syquest 000 code named mesa i believe it is a 00 winchester technology drive pretty much like the other syquest drives in terms of how it works according to the latest macleak the  drive has a 000 ms access time 00 mbs sustained throughput these figures are from memory so they could be slightly off but they give you an idea of performance nonetheless the drive was originally released for the pc and just recently was released for the mac world dont ask me what the  differences are and through they are currently in limited supply according to a syquest rep they are in the process of ramping up for mass production i have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in macleak including pli massmicro clubmac and macwarehouses poweruser the pli and massmicro units are priced at just around 0000 the lesser name brands are going for around 000 for an external drive cartridges which hold  000 mb sell for about 00 each at these prices the drives and cartridges are cheaper and better performing than the 00mb drives cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and bernoulli drives but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper and more reliable  personally im excited by the new drive and look forward to  getting my hands on one chris wand     egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity                                                       frank leahy

  send follow ups to compsysmacadvocacy sorry about the header but the  pnews here does not let one easily change the headers and i gave up after a  year of trying this sheet is also available by ftp on sumexaimstanfordedu  000000 in the infomacreport as macibmcompare000txt mac  ibm infoversion 000  the reason for this general data sheet is to consolidate and condense the  information out there so that people in both camps can be clear and accurate  about what they are saying about their machines  since computer technology  is always changing there are always going to be points in which the sheet will  be lacking or incorrect on information  so please just dont say the sheet  is incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to  make the needed corrections  all prices are in us dollars to keep this data sheet organized please provide if possible article  citations for the information provided or corrected and keep the opinions to  a minimum  as this is a general data sheet keep the info provided simple so  i can understand what is being talked about and can explain it to others  finally keep the information relevant to the section corrected for example  os code in rom is software contained in hardware so no more of the but it  is supported in os disk software data for the hardware section please  thank you note  for proper reading off line

quickdraw is optimized for 00 dpi display quickdraw qx  will change this in addition quickdraw allows in macs with a nubus slot more then one  monitor to be used in any combination from two monitors

special iicis could make use of the parity   feature by convension both simm types are called 00pin simms  the iifx   used 00pin parity simms  the lc iii c000000 and q000 all use a new   00pin simm that is accessable by 00bits at a time and is used in ibms  the mac does a complete memory check at startup by writingreading every  memory location if something is seriously wrong with a simm the mac will  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is  since macs made before feb 00 0000 managed memory baced on data path simms   had to be installed in pairs 00bit or in sets of 0

most of the coding must be provided in the os   since hard disks were slow the disk os code is read into ram  in addition  what little rom code there is also read into ram a process called shadow rom   this results in faster implementation since ram is faster then proms or  eproms  having most of the os code on disk has the advantage of being able to  better optimize the code given a certain piece

above treatment  of 000 occurs in an fpuequipped machine even when sane is bypassed and  the fpu programmed directly  ibm  floating point numbers are 00bits with a hardware fpu 00bits when  emulated  the way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever  compiler or assembler was used for a program on older dos complilers  exceptions could cause program aborts 00 and 000 would abort to

hardware builtin localtalk network port and a builtin printer port   localtalk has moderate speeds 0000 kbs requires special connectors for  each machine 00 and up and can be run off of either the printer port to  include very old macs or the network port standard today  builtin  ethernet is becoming common but many older macs require a pds or nubus card at  about 000000 for each machine  these cards provide three connectors and  transceivers thick thin and 00baset for ethernet the macintosh quadra family and some centris models includes ethernet  interface on motherboard with transceivers

novell netware is the biggest  00 percent of the corporate market and in general is more powerful and  offers better controlmanagementsecurity than appleshare but its also more  complex to set up and manage  this will change due to the use of the mac  finder and file management system by novell pc week 000000  000000   infoworld dec 0000 macweek 00000 printing very os dependent dos if its a single user then you plug the printer into the parallel port   and dont worry about it tweeking may be needed with poorly written   software  network printing is not controlled by the system but is mostly   implemented by the actual program therefore performance varies from one   software program to the next windows 0x supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing jobs   in the print queue but it always lists printers as active even if they   are not  this becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers   on the same net because theres no way for software to reliably determine   which printer is active right now  windows for workgroups is more maclike   and intelligent about this os0 maclike the os deals with printers with apps making calls to the os printing bugs due to poor programing some programs for all the above oses do  not have wysiwyg printing  this is the fault of the programs in question and  not that of the os involved  price issue this is very dynamic with mac providing more buildin features  than ibm and ibm being more get only what you need then mac and price wars  by both worlds the ibm machines modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware  standarization which in turn requires oses and programs to be very complex to  handle all the variation in hardware  when one adds all the standard mac  hardware features to an ibm builtin

  question for those familiar with quadra vram  i put 0 000k vram simms in my quadra 000 in the 0 slots closest to the ram simm slots and i got no results whatsoever  i have been told that the builtin video should support at least 00bit and maybe 00bit color on a macintosh color display  however the monitors control panel still lists 0bit 000 colors as the highest possible  the q000 will only do 0bit or 00bit color  if you want the higher color depth its 0mbs of vram altogether for a monitor up to 00  for a 00 monitor you can get 0bit max  hope this answers your questions  james wang

   i have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection  between a mac duo 000 and a pc i have used mackermit and versaterm on  the mac side i have used procomm kermit and softerm on os0 on  the pc or ps side i have used nonhardware handshaking and hardware  ahdshaking cables and know my hands are shaking from the effort nothing  has allowed file transfers from the mac to the ps     could i hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information  out the serial port of a duo 000 fast like via a modem or via a  sysex dump    could anyone with a duo help me out i am going absolutely insane  i wanna know if the problem is my duo or all duo 000s or all duos  or just me     hmmm sounds vaguely similar to a problem i had a long time ago when i was   trying to use kermit  i was building a serial connection between my duo 000   and my next  i think the problem was in the handshaking  basically you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides  a safe   place to start is by selecting no handshaking on either end  one problem is   that the zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong and only a reset will clear it  i dont know the specifics  but this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system    it could very well be that you are doing things righteventually but one   wrong move like trying a bad handshaking protocol can screw up any further   correct actions until the next machine reset  i have wedged my mac and also   my next that way  now i can send files back and forth between the duo and the next without any   problem and at pretty high speeds too  i dont know what kind of chip the pc uses but i think the zilog 0000 is   pretty standard  hope this helps avery

   attention mac quadra owners many storage industry experts have  concluded that mac quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating  from the standard scsi specification this results in silent corruption  of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices  although i will not name the devices since it is not their fault an  example would be a sony 00 inch mo without the special maccompatible  firmware installed one solution sometimes is to disable blind writes   to the best of my knowledge there arent any problems with quadras and blind transfers  trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the tibs or didnt test their driver with the device in question well designed tibs poll or loop at every point where delays of 00µsec occur this usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can hiccup in the middle of blocks  if this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going  in anycase the scsi manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync  actual data loss would only occur if the driver didnt pay attention to the errors coming back  note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the scsi bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the scsi manager  the problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the scsi chip when the next byte hasnt been clocked yet  also note that the bus error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesnt crash the machine  clinton bauder apple computer

  the logitech scanman 00 is a nice unit compact and effective it will bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality note that its effective resolution in grey scale mode is only about 00 dpi if you dont intend to magnify a graphic it works fine a true 000 level gray scanner would work better for images  ive seen the scanman go for as little as 000 used it is a reasonable buy at that price higher end hand scanners are almost as expensive as used flat bed scanners here is seattle the paper shows occasional good bargains in the classifieds used color flat beds have been seen as lows as 000 lately grey scale flatbeds come in around 000000

   a while ago when i owned a plus and wanted to upgrade its memory i just ordered the toolkit from macwarehouse for something like 0  it included an antistatic wrist strap the clamp used to split the clamshell case and the torx screwdriver  they might not be selling it anymore but give em and any other company that sells memory upgrades suitable for a plusstyle box a call  ill bet that they still offer the kit  next day air is usually the shipping method used too  im told that some of these companies often sell a plastic throw away after one use version of the torx driver so ask before you buy michael                     michael antolovich in wagga wagga a great place to be be             mantolovichcsueduau or antolovichzacrivcsueduau                
  after reading reports from germany of success in accelerating a quadra or centris simply by changing the clock oscillator i decided to test the claim i pulled out my variable speed overdrive and the motherboards 00 mhz clock chip i put a socket in the clocks place and inserted a 00 mhz ttl clock oscillator i had left over from working on some sis i cant believe it it actually works im not getting scsi timing errors either this is only after a short run time but ill keep posting results did i spend all that money on the vso for nothing if this keeps working the lack of a double boot in itself will be worth the effort  guy kuo guykuouwashingtonedu

    im currently trying to select which magnetooptical drive to purchase  im primarily looking at 000mb drives although i might consider 000mb ones  when looking through macworld and macuser ads the prices for the 000mb drives seem to range from just under 0000 for the dgr 000rem portable magic 000mb portable fujitsu or nudesign 000mb from macdirect to about 0000 for the fwb hammerdisk 000 and mass microsystems datapak mo000  different drives use different mechanisms  most fujitsu sony epson probably some others  my problem is that after reading the nov 00 macworld and apr 00 macuser reviews of these drives im still not sure what to get  so im asking if anyone has had goodbad experiences with any 000mb mo drive or can shed some light on the wide range of prices is spending more really buying me much reliability of different drives compatibility between them or  anything else i should probably know  thanks  john sasinowski

  the real question here in my opinion is what motorola processors running system 0 on a mac are comparable to what intel processors running windows on a pc  i recall there being a conversation here that a 00000 running windows benchmarks at about the same speed as 00mhz 000 in system 0  i dont know if that is true but i would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this  david  that seems about right  i have a mac iisi 0000 with 00k cache card running system 00  my roommate has a 000sx00 0000 running windows 00 and from what ive seen my iisi is faster in some operations  in others they are comparablebut keep in mind im strictly speaking of operations on the desktop level of windows 00 and system 00 not actual computational speed in other programs  
  steve bollinger buzzapplecom writes   enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games  the sound driver is pretty ok since its fast sound manager used by the book is useless disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation its too slow  the sound driver is so much snappier than sound manager unfortunately system 0 supports it poorly making programs crash occasionally  the more of the story is to developers dont cheat really i am absolutely positively not allowed to do what i am about to do but im going say it anyway stop cheating on sound really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware the grace period is about to end the sound manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will work even better soon so use it  well i want my code to work on old systems too i dont know about sys 00 but at least on 000 there are bugs in the sound manager that causes channels to hang with no error message this happends when i keep a channel open for long periods  necessary for performance  and play many sounds stopping sounds halfway callbacks seems not to be reliable then only way i can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel qhead i think it was and the only way i have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an undocumented flag and modify it  am i happy with this nope i consider writing to soundbase simply to get rid of the bugs  any better suggestions silent games is not among the acceptabe solutions    ingemar ragnemalm dept of electrical engineering     uunetmcvaxenearainieringemar                    university of linkoping sweden     ingemarisyliuse

  i guess the real question is  who asked the original questions and why was it so broad are we talking pure processing power what kind of processing btw isolated from every other factor and influence in the system   or are we shopping for a home computer based on the cpu specs yuck  i just finished a project that involves realtime processing of serial data and discovered that the programming interface assembly has a lot to do with the power of a cpu in a particular application if what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given then not only is it easy but its cheap and quick  if you have to fake things like resolving indirection without a lea instruction then your cycle count goes through the roof  well lets not start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose the orginal question was about classifying microprocessors having reread the entire thread i dont think much more can be said without getting down into specific proposed systems with important details given   thats it for another 000  cheers everyone      peter pundy    email 0000000jefflabqueensuca    ive got no witty wisdom to share but have a nice day anyway

  i purchased an lciii recently and had heard a bit about a rework of the logic board  i opened mine up and found the same rework with a small chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two  other chips  id like to know more about it  could anyone with any or all of the following information please post it  thanks a bunch  0what does the rework accomplish ie what does it fix 0what are the technical details of the rework  im looking for things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected and the pinouts for those chips 0is a board with the rework any different functionally from one without 0could the reworked boards be incompatible with future releases of the operating system  and finally  0should i even be concerned about any of this    keith folsom folsomcupportalcom

  hortonwhatspsmotcom david horton writes bm000clevelandfreenetedu david kantrowitz writes   when the computer is set for 000 colors and certain operations are done  particularly vertical scrolling through a window horizontal white lines  appear on the monitor which generally but not always spare open  windows  these lines accummulate as the operation is continued  if a  window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away  the line disappear from that area of the screen  this problem is not  observed if the monitor is configured for 00 colors or a 00 inch apple  monitor with 000 colors is used  has anyone not had these problems in the given configurations that would help eliminate design flaw as the explanation  as a data point im using a centris 000 000 with the apple 00 monitor and do not have these problems   i can produce similar artifacts  i am using a centris 000 with an apple 00 monitor  i got the 0000cd configuration so there is onboard ethernet and 0 megabyte of video ram the effect only occurs in 000 color and 000 grey modes  any vertical scrolling operation whether with a scrollbar or say using vi and inserting lines will produce a scattering of horizontal flickering lines on the screen they do not persist  each is visible for perhaps one refresh and then that part of the screen is back as usual  they seem to always start at or about the 00th pixel from the left and are maybe 000 pixels wide  this is certainly not preventing me from using my macintosh  but it does seem to be a sign of something perhaps grounded incorrectly in the video circuitry   i went ahead and called the apple customer assistance center at   00000000000 or 00000000000 more direct  the person who answered was polite   i also took the chance to complain about my mouse button sticking and about the mac hanging on boot after a hard  killed macsbug crash which left a cd in the drive  i had to play with a paperclip for about 0 minutes to get thing to eject after which the mac booted fine   garth dickie  dickiemathwiscedu

faq  the second part is    posted to compsysmacsystem and features many questions about   system  software  the third part is posted every two weeks in   compsysmacmisc  tables of contents for those two pieces are   included above please familiarize  yourself with all three   sections of this document  before posting              all pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from   rtfmmitedu 00000000 in the directory    pubusenetnewsanswersmacintosh  except for this introductory   faq which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as   generalfaqz the name of each file has the format of the last   part of the group name followed by faqz eg the faq for   compsysmacsystem is stored as systemfaqz and the faq for   compsysmacmisc is stored as miscfaqz  rtfm stores files as    compressed z binary files  if you leave off the z at the end   of  the file name when getting the file rtfm will automatically    decompress the file before sending it to you  you can also have    these files mailed to you by sending an email message to    mailserverrtfmmitedu with the line  send   pubusenetnewsanswersmacintoshname  in the body text where   name is the name of the file you want as  specified above eg   generalfaq  you can also send this server a message with the   subject help for more detailed instructions               i have a question  00             congratulations  youve come to the right place  usenet is    a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions   how do i lock a floppy disk to queries that would make steve   jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror  i used   resedit to remove resources init 00 wdef 00 and nvir 00 from my   system file and used the hex editor to add code string a00b00 as a   patch to the sfgetfile routine so the standard file dialog box   would be a nice shade of mauve  everything worked fine until i   installed supercdevblaster and now when i use the aldus driver to   print from pagemaker 00d0 to a linotronic 0000 my system hangs    ps  im running system 000 on a powerbook 000            since the macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume we   ask that you first peruse this faq list including at least the   table of contents for the other pieces of it check any other   relevant online resources listed below in question 00 especially   the faq lists for the other macintosh newsgroups and rtfm read   the friendly manual before posting your question  we realize that   you are personally incensed that the system is taking up fourteen   of your newlyinstalled twenty megs of ram but this question has   already made its way around the world three hundred times before   and its developing tired feet  finally before posting to any   newsgroup macintosh or otherwise please familiarize yourself   with the basic etiquette of usenet as described in the newsgroup   newsannouncenewusers    how do i use this document  where can i get it  00                 compsysmacfaq is currently divided into multiple pieces   a general introduction which youre reading now and specific lists   for the newsgroups compsysmacsystem and compsysmacmisc  faq   lists for compsysmacwanted compsysmacapps and   compsysmachardware are in development  when ready each part   will be available in its respective newsgroup  all pieces are   available via anonymous ftp from rtfmmitedu in the   pubusenetnewsanswersmacintosh directory except for this   document itself which is named generalfaqz the pieces are named   as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by   faq eg systemfaqz miscfaqz  the z means the  file is   stored compressed so youll need to ftp it in binary mode and use   either maccompress stuffit deluxe or the unix uncompress command    to decompress it  however if you leave off the z extension when    you get the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file   before sending it to you              this introductory document is posted to all of the concerned   newsgroups  the tables of contents for each of the specific faq   lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to   get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere   else in the faq even if you dont have the other parts at hand    its not always obvious especially to newcomers where a   particular question or comment should be posted  please   familiarize yourself with the faq lists in all the major macintosh   newsgroups before posting in any of them  which questions appear   in which faqs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong   where              to jump to a particular question search for   sectionnumberquestionnumber enclosed in parentheses  for   example to find where can i ftp macintosh software search for   the string  00  to jump to a section instead of a question   use a zero for  the question number    what other information is available  00        compsysmacfaq provides short answers to a number of    frequently asked questions appropriate for the usenet newsgroup   compsysmacmisc and compsysmacsystem  four other files are   worthy of particular note daryl spitzer maintains a faq list   covering macintosh programming for the newsgroup   compsysmacprogrammer  its posted to that group weekly and    available for anonymous ftp from ftpcsuoregon 00000000 in    pubmac  eric rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list    for compsysmaccomm available in that newsgroup and from   rascalicsutexasedu in macfaq where the file youre reading now   is also irregularly archived  this list answers many frequently   asked questions about networking unix and the mac   telecommunications and foreign file formats  norm walsh has   compiled an excellent faq for compfonts that answers a lot of   questions about the various kinds of fonts and crossplatform   conversion and printing  its available in compfonts or by ftp   from ibiscsumassedu in pubnormcompfontsfaq  finally jim   jagielski maintains a faq for compunixaux covering apples unix   environment aux  its posted every 0 to 0 weeks in compunixaux   and newsanswers its available for anonymous ftp at   jaguboxgsfcnasagov    which newsgroup should i post to  00          there are no stupid questions but there are misplaced ones    you wouldnt ask your english teacher how to do the definite   integral  of ln x between zero and one would you  so dont ask   the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when microsoft   word is in the background  ignorance of basic netiquette is not an   excuse if you want people to help you you need to learn their   ways of  communicating            posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your   mailbox with pearls of wisdom and maybe a few rotten oysters too      posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering   silence  for instance the most common and glaring mispost one   that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the macintosh regions of   usenet as would a purple elephant to aleuts in the arctic asking a   question about networking anywhere except compsysmaccomm   normally produces no useful responses  posting the same question   to compsysmaccomm ensures that your post is read and considered   by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few   network software designers             please post to exactly one newsgroup  do not crosspost    if a question isnt important enough for you to take the extra   minute to figure out where it properly belongs its not important   enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading    for the same reason compsysmacmisc should not be used as a   catchall newsgroup             the breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in   this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs   where  specifically questions about productivity applications   software you bought your macintosh to run not software you bought   to make your macintosh run better should go to compsysmacapps   unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup    communications programs games hypercard compilers and databases   all have more topical compsysmac newsgroups  post questions   about noncommunications hardware including questions about what   software is necessary to make particular hardware work to   compsysmachardware  questions about macos system software   belong in compsysmacsystem  questions about utilities and   extensions normally belong in compsysmacmisc  questions about   aux go to compunixaux  detailed questions about appletalk   belong in compprotocolsappletalk             direct questions about hypercard to compsysmachypercard    nonhypercard programming questions and questions about development   environments should go to compsysmacprogrammer  resedit   questions may be posted either to compsysmacmisc   compsysmacsystem or compsysmacprogrammer but generally the   netters who inhabit the darker recesses of compsysmacprogrammer   are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking              a general exception to the above rules is that any very   technical question about an application that actually begins to   delve into the hows of a program as well as the whats recent   example how does writenow which is written entirely in assembly   compare to other word processors written in high level languages   might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup               for sale and want to buy posts should go to   compsysmacwanted and miscforsalecomputersmac only  we   understand that youre desperate to sell your upgraded 000k mac to   get the  for a powerbook 000 but trust me anyone who wants to   buy it will be reading compsysmacwanted  political and   religious questions the mac is better than windows is not is   too is not is too hey how bout the amiga what about it is   not is too belong in compsysmacadvocacy  anything not   specifically mentioned above probably belongs in compsysmacmisc             finally dont be so provincial as to consider only the   compsysmac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions    many questions about modems in compsysmaccomm are much more   thoroughly discussed in compdcommodems  questions about mac midi   are often better handled in compmusic even though its not a   macintosh specific newsgroup  shop around  usenets a big place   and not everything relevant to the macintosh happens in   compsysmac    0 someone just asked why the system was taking up sixteen of  their  twenty megabytes of ram  shouldnt i put my brilliance and  wit on  display for the world by posting the seventeenth response        no  frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as   frequent questions  unless you really have something new to add to   the traditional answers such as the recent discovery that fonts in   system 00 could eat memory private email is a much better medium   for answering common questions like this one              you might want to add a mention of this faq in your email   response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it   before posting future questions  i do read all the newsgroups   covered here and have written a small script in microphone ii that   lets me send pwfaqs people with frequently asked questions the   section

are sumexaimstanfordedu 000000   macarchiveumichedu 00000000000 and wuarchivewustledu   0000000000 which mirrors the other two sites and several   others wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove   them for space concerns and still has files that were deleted from   the formerly important site rascalicsutexasedu  rascal was   notable for storing its files in macbinary format rather than the   less efficient binhex format common at the other archives  unless   otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document   should be available at the above sites           to keep traffic on the internet manageable scandinavians    should try connecting to ftpfunetfi 0000000000 ftplthse   000000000 or sicsse 0000000000 instead  those in    the uk should look first at

prog filename to find what   youre looking for or type help for more detailed instructions    for instance you would type prog disinfectant to search for a   convenient ftp site for disinfectant  if the initial search fails   to turn up the file you want try variations on and substrings of   the name  for instance if you didnt find disinfectant with prog   disinfectant you might try prog disi instead  substring   searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross  to avoid many   erroneous matches add a hqx to the end of the substring eg   prog disihqx  most mac software available on the net ends in   hqx but almost no unix or pc software does            please check the above archives and archie personally before   asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware  if you   follow the above advice you should almost never have to ask the   net where to find a particular piece of software    can someone mail me application x  00        no  nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from   compbinariesmac that was corrupt or missed at your site  please   refer to the first questions in this section to find out about   anonymous ftp archie and automatic email servers    what is bin hqx cpt etc  00        most files available by ftp are modified twice to allow them to   more easily pass through foreign computer systems  first theyre   compressed to make them faster to download and then theyre   translated to either a binhex hqx or macbinary bin format   that other computers can digest  the macintosh uses a special   twofork filing system that chokes most other computers  binhex   files are 0bit ascii text files while macbinary files are pure   0bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary   protocol             how a file has been translated and compressed for   transmission is indicated by its suffix  normally a file will have   a name something like filenamexxxyyy  xxx indicates how it was   compressed and yyy indicates how it was translated  to use a file   youve ftpd and downloaded to your mac youll need to reverse the   process  most files you get from the net require a twostep   decoding process  first change the binhex hqx or macbinary   bin file to a doubleclickable macintosh file then decompress   it  which programs decode which file types is covered in the table   below  also note that most macintosh telecommunications programs   will  automatically convert macbinary files to regular macintosh   files as they are downloaded   suffix      sit  cpt  hqx  bin  pit  z  image  dd  zip uu  tar

them  versions of stuffit earlier than 00 stuffit 000   stuffit classic unstuffit and stuffit deluxe 00 and 00 will   not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by stuffit 00    you need to get a more recent version of stuffit or stuffit   expander                stuffit 000 lite and deluxe consistently makes smaller   archives than any other macintosh compression utility  to allow   maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep   netbandwidth down please compress all files you send to anonymous   ftp sites with stuffit 000              uutool maccompress and suntar handle the popular unix   formats of  uuencode uu compress z and tar tar   respectively  the unix versions are often more robust than the mac   products so use them instead when thats an  option  translators   that allow stuffit lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also   available by anonymous ftp              macutil is dik winters package of unix utilities to   decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading   them to a mac since unix stores files differently than does the   mac macutil creates macbinary bin files which should be   automatically converted on download  it cant decompress   everything in particular it cant decompress the new stuffit 00   archives   however if you need only one or two files out of an   archivefor instance if you want to read the readme to find out if   a program does what you need it to do before you download all of   itmacutil is indispensable  it can be found at sumexaim in the   infomacunix directory       a few notes on the compression formats        bin  these are macbinary files  always use a binary file   transfer protocol when transferring them never ascii or text    most files on the net are stored as hqx instead  only rascal   stores most of its files in bin format  most communications   programs such as zterm and mackermit are capable of translating   macbinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance   theyll be downloading macbinary files          image this format is normally used only for system software   so that online users can download files that can easily be   converted into exact copies of the installer floppies  instead of   using diskcopy to restore the images to floppies you can use steve   christensens freeware utility  mountimage to treat the images on   your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive    mountimage has a reputation for being buggy so you should have   some blank floppies and a copy of diskcopy handy just in case          sea x x  sea files dont merit a position in the above   table because theyre selfextracting  they may have been created   with compact pro stuffit or even diskdoubler but all should be   capable of decompressing themselves when doubleclicked  for some   unknown reason alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard   designation for selfextracting archives created with their    payware products superdisk and more disk space  instead they    append either x or x to selfextracting archives    how can i get binhex  stuffit  etc  00        by far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human   being to copy them onto a floppy for you  if youre at a   university theres absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to   give you a copy and if youre anywhere less remote than mcmurdo   sound chances are very good that someone at a computer center   dealership or user group can provide you with a copy of stuffit    once you have stuffit any version you dont need binhex               if youre such a computer geek that the thought of actually   asking a living breathing human being instead of a computer    terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of    protoplasmic jelly you can probably download a working copy  of   stuffit from a local bulletin board system              if you have religious objections to software gotten by any    means other than anonymous ftp then i suppose ill mention that    you can in fact ftp a working copy of stuffit though this is by    far the hardest way to get it  ftp to wuarchivewustledu and    login  type the word binary  hit return  type cd   mirrorsrascalicsutexaseducompression and hit return  then   get stuffitexpander000seabin  and hit return  of course   its always possible that by the time you read this stuffit   expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this   fails look for something similar  if youve ftpd straight onto   your mac you should now have a selfextracting archive which will   produce a working copy of stuffit expander when doubleclicked  if   youve ftpd to your mainframe or unix account first you still   need to use a modem program to download it to your mac  just make   sure that the mac is receiving in macbinary mode and the mainframe   is sending in binary mode  if you need more details on the last   step consult the faq list for compsysmaccomm and the manuals   for both your mainframe and macintosh telecommunications software         how can i get binhex stuffit etc from a pc  00         you cant  there is absolutely no way to get an executable   macintosh file from an ftp site onto a pc and then onto your mac   without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp   you must beg borrow or steal the necessary software such as   binhex or stuffit lite from another person  i realize this may    terrify those among you who havent left your parents basement    since you got an  apple ii in 0000 but eventually youre going    to need to link up with some human being other than your mother     though i suppose if youre this much of  a nerd you could send    your mother out to get it for you  while youre gathering   your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world    of daylight please dont bother the net by asking this question   again  there simply is no way to move executable macintosh   programs from a pc or other nonmacintosh computer onto a    mac without software that is not bundled with most macs     troubleshooting what to do before posting when things go wrong 00             while the various faq lists cover a lot of specific   problems there are far more problems that arent covered here    these are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking   for help  you should probably also perform the tenstep   preventative maintenance routine described in section four   especially rebuilding the desktop 00 and resizing the system   heap 00  following these steps may  or may not solve your   problem but it will at least make it easier  for others to   recommend solutions to you   identify the problem  00        microsoft word is crashing doesnt say much  what were you   doing when it crashed  can you repeat the actions that lead to the   crash  the more information you provide about the actions   preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you    the more precisely youve identified the problem and the actions   preceding it step 0 the easier it will be to tell if the   following steps fix the problem  for example sometimes   quarkxpress 00 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error is   not nearly as helpful as quarkxpress 00 crashes when i link two   text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already   contain text  the former will leave you wondering whether the bug   remains after a given step  the latter lets you go right to the   problem and see if its still there or not    read the read me file  00        many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and   bugs in their read me files  often these arent documented in the   manual read any read me files to see if any of the problems sound   familiar    check for viruses  00        run disinfectant or another antiviral across your disk  virus   infections are rarer than most people think but they do occur and   they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do    reinstall the application and all its support files  00              for half a dozen reasons external magnetic fields   improperly written software the alignment of the planets a file   on a disk may not contain the data its supposed to contain  this   can cause all types of unexplained unusual behavior  restoring   from original masters will normally fix this    reinstall the system software  00          bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file   than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous    see question 00 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean   reinstall              if the problem continues to occur after youve taken these   steps chances are youve found either a conflict between your   application and some other software or a genuine bug in the   program  so its time to    isolate the problem  00              you need to find the minimal system on which the problem   will assert itself  here are the basic steps of isolating the   cause of a system or application crash         arun only one application at a time occasionally applications do      conflict with each other  if the problem does not manifest itself      without other applications running simultaneously you can begin      launching other applications until you find the one that causes       the crash            bif youre running system 0 turn off multifinder  if youre      running system 0 allot as much memory to the application as you       can afford  sometimes programs just need more memory especially       when performing complicated operations            c if youre running system 0 turn off virtual memory and 00bit      addressing  theres still an awful lot of system 0 hostile      software out there including some from companies that really       have no excuse  can you say microsoft word 00 boys and girls        i knew you could  some of this software only expresses its       incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken            dboot from a virgin system floppy  if the problem disappears      you likely have an init conflict  you need to progressively remove      extensions until the problem vanishes  use a little common sense      when choosing the first extensions to remove  if the problem occurs      when you try to open a file remove any inits that mess with the      standard file open procedure such as super boomerang first  if the      problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated      either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or if you have      a lot of them perform a binary search by removing half of the      extensions at a time  once the problem disappears add half of the      most recently removed set back  continue until youve narrowed the      conflict down to one extension  when you think youve found the      offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make       sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem    contact technical support  00        by now you should have a very good idea of when where and why   the conflict occurs  if a tech support number is available for the   software call it  if youre lucky the company will have a work   around or fix available  if not perhaps theyll at least add the   bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release            preventive maintenance  00          you wouldnt drive your car 000000 miles without giving it a   tuneup  a computer is no different  regular tuneups avoid a lot   of problems  although there are mac mechanics wholl be happy to   charge you 00 or more for the equivalent of an oil change theres   no reason you cant change it yourself  the following ninestep   program should be performed about every three months     trash unneeded files  00        many of the operations that follow will run faster and more   smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a   little time cleaning up your hard disk  if youre at all like me   youll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for   applications you no longer have archives of software youve   dearchived shareware you tried out and didnt like announcements   for events that have come and gone and many other files you no   longer need  if youre running system 0 you may also have several   more megabytes in your trash can alone  throw them away and empty    the trash    rethink your extensions  00        some macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain    seriously consider whether you actually need every extension    in your collection  if you dont use the functionality of an   extension at least every fifth time you boot up youre probably   better off not storing it in your system folder where it only takes   up memory destabilizes your system and slows down every startup    for instance if you only read pc disks once a month theres no   need to keep accesspc loaded all the time  cutting back on your   extension habit can really help avoid crashes     rebuild the desktop  00        the desktop filedatabase holds all the information necessary   to associate each file with the application that created it  it   lets the system know what application should be launched when you   open a given file and what icons it should display where    depending on its size each application has one or more   representatives in the desktop file  as applications and files   move on and off your hard disk the desktop file can be become   bloated and corrupt  think of it as a congress for your mac    every so often its necessary to throw the bums out and start with   a clean slate  fortunately its easier to rebuild the desktop than   to defeat an incumbent              one warning rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments   youve stored in the get info boxes  under system 0 maurice   volaskis freeware init commentkeeper will retain those comments   across a rebuild  commentkeeper also works with system 0 but only    if apples desktop manager extension is also installed              to rebuild the desktop restart your mac and as your   extensions finish loading depress the command and option keys    youll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild   the desktop and warning you that this could take a few minutes    click ok it will take more than a few minutes the more files you   have the longer it will take  if youre running system 0 you may   want to turn off multifinder before trying to rebuild the desktop               if youre experiencing definite problems and not just doing   preventive maintenance you may want to use fifth generations   freeware init desktop reset  desktop reset completely deletes the   desktop file before rebuilding it thus eliminating possibly   corrupt data structures        zap the pram and reset the clock  00        all macs from the original 000k thin mac to the quadra 000   contain a small amount of battery powered ram to hold certain   settings that properly move with the cpu rather than with the disk   such as which disk to boot from  unfortunately this parameter   ram can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes  to reset   it under system 0 hold down the command option p and r keys   while restarting your mac  under system 0 hold down the command   option and shift keys while selecting the control panel from the   apple menu click yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter   ram  since youve erased almost all the settings in the general   control panel you should now reset them to whatever you want              the one setting that zapping the pram does not erase is the    date and time but since the internal clock in the macintosh is   notoriously inaccurate youll probably want to take this   opportunity to reset it anyway    resize the system heap  00         even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most   people still have at least half a row of icons march across the   bottom of their screen every time they restart  all these   extensions and most applications too need space in a section of   memory called the system heap  if the system heap isnt big enough   to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of   it they all start playing king of the mountain on the system heap   knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and   trying to climb back on after they get knocked off  all this   fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance   and almost inevitably crashes the mac             if youre using system 0 your macintosh will automatically   resize the system heap as necessary but if youre running system 0   its important to set your system heap size large enough to manage   all your extensions and applications  by default this size is set   to 000k way too small for most macs with any extensions at all    the system heap size is stored in the normally noneditable boot   blocks of every system disk  bill steinbergs freeware utility   bootman not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks   how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much   needs to be allocated  if youre running system 0 get bootman   use it and be amazed at how infrequently your macintosh crashes    reinstall the system software  00        system files can become corrupt and fragmented especially if   youve stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them    merely updating the system software will often not fix system file   corruption  i recommend doing a clean reinstall  heres how      0  boot from the installer floppy of your system disks       0  copy any nonstandard fonts and desk accessories out          of your system file into a temporary suitcase     0  trash the system file on your hard disk  also trash the          finder multifinder da handler and all other standard apple          extensions like control panel and chooser  these will all be          replaced in the new installation  if youre running or          installing system 0 move everything in the extensions          control panels and preferences folders into the top level          of the system folder     0  rename the system folder  any name other than system folder          is  fine     0  doubleclick the installer script on your system disk  then          choose customize  select the appropriate software for your          model mac and printer  you could do an easy install instead          but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you dont          need that waste your memory and disk space     0  once installation is finished move everything from the          temporary folder you created in step 0 into the new system          folder  if youre asked if you want to replace anything you          forgot to take something out in step 0  youll need to replace          things individually until you find the duplicate piece      0  reinstall any fonts or das you removed in step 0     0  reboot  you should now have a clean defragmented system file          that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable          system overall        disk utilities  00        much like system files hard disks have data structures that   occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even   causing data loss  apple includes disk first aid a simple utility   for detecting and repairing hard disk problems with its system   disks its also available for anonymous ftp from ftpapplecom in   the  directory dtsmacsyssofthdsc  even if you have an earlier    version you should get the latest version 00 from ftpapplecom   and run it on all your hard disks                several companies have released payware disk utilities that   detect and repair considerably more problems than disk first aid   though interestingly none of them detect and repair everything   that disk first aid does  the three most effective for general   work are central points mactools deluxe 00 fifth generations   public utilites and symantecs norton utilities for the macintosh   00  a department or work group should have all of these as well   as disk first aid since none of them fix everything the others do    for individuals mactools 00 street is about half the price of   norton 00 street or public utilities 00 street so features   and ease of use being roughly equal i recommend mactools              all of these products occasionally encounter problems they   cant fix  when that happens its time to backup 00 and   reformat 00        backing up  00        this is one part of preventative maintenance that should be   done a lot more often than every three months  the simplest back   up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies   or other removable media  if you keep your data files separate   from your application and support files then its easy to only back   up those folders which change frequently  nonetheless every three   months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk              a number of programs are available to make backing up   easier  apple included a very basic full backup application with   system 0  with the performas apple ships a new apple backup   utility that can backup the entire disk or just the system folder   onto floppies  the previously mentioned norton utilities for the   mac and mactools deluxe 00 include more powerful floppy backup   utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups             finally if youre lucky enough to have a tape drive network   server or removable media device to use for backups you should   check out the more powerful payware utilities redux 00 street   doesnt support tape drives and diskfit pro 00 street  there   are no freely available backup utilities other than the old hd   backup from system 0      disk defragmentation  00        as disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free   space in the same place to write large files  therefore the   operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be   stored in different places on your hard disk  as files become more   and more fragmented performance can degrade  there are several   ways to defragment a hard disk             the most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your   files erase the hard disk and you might as well reformat while   youre at it  see question 000 and restore all the files              a number of payware utilities including norton utilities for   the mac and mac tools deluxe can defragment a disk in place ie   without erasing it  although the ads for all these products brag   about their safety once youve bought the software and opened the   shrinkwrap they all warn you to back up your disk before   defragmenting it in case something does go wrong  there are no   freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please dont annoy the   net by asking for one     reformat your hard disk  000        just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use so a   hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data  you dont   need to reformat every three months but when your system is   crashing no matter what you try reformatting is the ultimate means   of wiping the slate clean  reformatting your hard disk may even   gain you a few extra megabytes of space  not all hard disks are   created equal  some can hold more data than others  to facilitate   mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks  000   megabytes is the average formatted capacity  your mileage may   vary  apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator   of drive capacity  when you reformat theres no reason at all not   to reclaim whatever unused space apples left on your disk                unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to   initialize them most hard disks come with formatting software    apples disks and system software ship with hd sc setup a minimal   disk formatter which will format apple brand hard drives only    most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with   their hard drives  normally this will be all you need to reformat   your hard disk             a number of generalpurpose formatters are also available   which go beyond the bundled software to include features like   encryption password protection multiple partitioning faster disk   access system 0 compatibility and even compression  two of the   best are the payware drive0 and hard disk toolkit personal edition   00 street for either  while there are one or two freeware   formatters available none are likely to be superior to the ones   bundled with your hard disk              powerbook users should be sure to turn off sleep and   processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter   what software they use  otherwise disk corruption crashes and   data losses are a very good possibility        elliotte rusty harold         department of mathematics   elharoshivanjitedu         new jersey institute of technology

   several weeks ago i described a problem with my apple highresolution monitor and promised to summarize replies received by email to recapitulate occasionally every two or three hours or so my monitor momentarily loses sync the entire raster image bounces down about an eighth of an inch or so then rights itself this usually happens right after i close a large window highlight a large area or do something that radically alters the image on the screen sometimes though it happens with no provocation whatsoever  i have received a bewildering range of replies at one extreme was a man clearly quite knowledgable about monitors who said that the problem was that the 00 monitors power supply simply couldnt always keep up with sudden changes of the raster image the rapid change from a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitors power supply there was no fix available he said because nothing was really wrong i guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that it had to be endured  this seemed quite persuasive and i would have been tempted to adopt an attitude of stoicism except for a reply from a 00 monitor owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the  apple service technical procedures volume 0 under the heading jitter correction the section describes a fix involving the replacement of a capacitor the adjustment of a potentiometer or failing that the swap of a circuit board  i would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had experience with this sort of thing

   re methods for attaching heat sink to processor  go to radio shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound it comes in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap  at radio shack its catalog number 0000000  its a mix of silicone and zinc oxide and conducts heat very well  plus its tacky  usually you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink and then bolt or clamp the sink down but if you dont move your mac gravity and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold things in place  just make sure you remember its in there in case you tilt your mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose  you wouldnt want a loose piece of metal running around inside your mac

  writes enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games  the sound driver is pretty ok since its fast sound manager used by the book is useless disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation its too slow  why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon if you are trying to write a game you shouldnt be using sndplay instead make a channel and use buffercmds to play sounds on it it works great you can add callbacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty before it gets empty   the sound driver is so much snappier than sound manager unfortunately system 0 supports it poorly making programs crash occasionally  the moral of the story is to developers dont cheat  well i want my code to work on old systems too i dont know about sys 00 but at least on 000 there are bugs in the sound manager that causes channels to hang with no error message this happends when i keep a channel open for long periods  necessary for performance  and play many sounds stopping sounds halfway callbacks seems not to be reliable then only way i can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel qhead i think it was and the only way i have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an undocumented flag and modify it  callbacks are very reliable i found them 000 reliable even under system 00 i was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on system 00 with the imv documentation  you probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels of course you didnt get called in general if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel with the related slowdown but then when you play more than one you dont work then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel possibly the same one multiple times this might be because you are calling sndplay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them you need to resedit the sound and remove that command then when you create your channel specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channels synth then you can use asynch sndplays all you want youll probably want to switch to buffercmds since you are going to have to use snddocommand anyway to add callbacks  now before you go ahead and tell me i am full of it and the sound manager doesnt work for games remember spectre uses it and it works great if spectre can spare the cpu time you can too  one little disclaimer there are some out there who say the sound manager in the iisi cant be made to work right im not sure either way but i know for sure that you can make your sounds work 000 correctly on every other machine using the sound manager  steve

  i posted on here about a problem with a datadesk 000e keyboard that failed to rebuild the desktop with the commandoption keys pressed or to shut off inits when pressing the shift key  after absolutely no help from datadesk i called macconnection tech support  they tried it out on their centris 000 and had the same problem  they immediately offered to get a new keyboard try it on their centris and ship it to me overnight if it worked  i could send them my keyboard back after i got the one that worked  this is from a guy in tech support named dave it turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face before pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing commandoption  i really like this keyboard so i was glad to be able to keep it  on the other hand datadesks tech support sucks while macconnections is great terry

  if anyone has any information about the upcoming new computers cyclone and tempest i am in need of some info anything would be greatly appreciated  shawn breedsawkuvx0bitnet  according to macweek of 00000  the cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the quadra 000 while the tempest will share the lowslung case of the centris 000 apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted above the users monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take pictures of objects or documents taking advantage of the 00bit digital signal processor dsp built into the systems logic boards the camera will be able to put an image measuring 000 by 000 pixels with 000 gray levels on the screen  users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit the camera is expected to cost between 000 and 000  the systems will ship with all the software needed to put apples casper voicerecognition technology to work users apparently will have to purchase an operational highfidelity microphone  the two models will talk as well as listen a new system facility called the speech manager will convert text strings sent by applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer  the cyclone will include a 00mhz 000 three nubus slots and support for up to 000mb of ram the tempest will use a 00mhz lc000 lacking an fpu and hold up to 00mb of ram it will have a single slot that will require a nubus adapter and have room for only 0inch nubus cards users will be able to update the tempests process but not the cyclones  for more get the 000000 issue of macweek  
  repost  due to net problems  hi    i have problems with the fdhd on a iicx that ekg reports is rom revision 000 i had reports that this mac was having trouble  formatting disks and by the time i got to it the fdhd just would not respond although all other functions were fine  i checked the voltages on the db00 external drive connector and pin 0 showed no volts with 0 and 0 giving 00volts unloaded the power  supply is an astec and i sent it away for repair  with the power supply reinstalled i now get the following error  with the internal fdhd connected the mac boots fine but on completion of boot cycle an alert displays the disk is unreadable  do you want to eject it for every combination of response the alert  reappears within approx 0 seconds and this error is continuous the fdhd does spin but there is no head seeking and the fdhd is incapable of ejecting the disk this error sequence occurs regardless of whether there is a floppy in the drive or not pin 0 on the db00 external  connector shows 00v pins 0 and 0 show 0000v  with the internal fdhd disconnected the mac boots fine and works great  macekg reports no errors the db00 external connector now shows no voltage on pin 0 but pins 0 and 0 show 0000v  now the internal fdhd may be fubar but i have an apple 000k external drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when connected to either the external db00 or the internal connector at j00 after suitable surgery to the external drive the voltages at j00  with the internal fdhd disconnected are as follows  pinvoltspinvolts 000 000 000 00 0000 0000 000000000 000000000 00000000 000000000  this machine has a swim which i dont think ekg tests i have tested all diodes and pica fuses and can find no problems does anybody have any ideas                           best wishes                           woody                                 paul woodman                                   praxis plc                             the software engineering company of touche ross                       00 manvers street bath ba0 0px uk                    tel 00 000 000000 xt000              fax 00 000 000000      woodypraxiscouk

  here is how i modified my quadra 000 for higher speed previously i had been using a variable speed overdrive for accelerating my cpu but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds  your mileage may vary the top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before hand my personal q000 has tested fine up to 00 mhz thus far i didnt have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds  parts  clock oscillators 0 pin ttl variety you will need a selection of speeds beginning at 00 mhz on up the cpu will run at 00 the oscillator speed the original one is a 00 mhz unit i recommend getting a 00 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one     i obtained my clock oscillators from digikey 00000000000 for    less than 000 each some of their part numbers are     00 mhz ttl clock oscillator part  x000    00 mhz ttl clock oscillator part  x000    00 mhz ttl clock oscillator part  ctx000     dont get the half size clock oscillators they wont fit     there are also cmos clock oscillators i havent tried one in a    quadra they work fine in iisis     socket obtain a 0 pin socket which is in the same form factor as    a 00 pin dip package alternatively use 0 machined socket pins    from an augat style socket just cut them out of the socket  cooling fan a very small 00 volt fan to keep the cpu cool is a     must my vso came with a specially modified heatsink which had    a fan built onto it it had a passthrough connector which    tapped into the hard drive power cable you should rig up     something similar or risk frying your cpu     procedure  0  insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here  0  remove the top lid of the machine you will see the floppy disk and     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower follow the usual antistatic     precautions and of course make sure the machine is off when you do     this unplug all cables wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the mac   0  remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up     the tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply you may     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power     supply leave that alone the plastic tab from the tower is all you     need release   0  look at the rear of the tower assembly you will see the flat ribbon     scsi connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable     leading to the floppy drive disconnect all these from the motherboard     the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed     to release it                                              0  unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount  0  look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower a     phillips head screw is at the base remove it taking care not to drop     it into the case a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful     here  0  remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the     right side of the tower this tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly slide the entire tower assembly 0 cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case  0  remove the interrupt switch assembly it is a strangely shaped plastic     device at the left front edge of the motherboard pull the middle rear plastic prong up and forward the entire device will release  0  unplug the speaker cable squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to     free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case  00 remove the motherboard form the case lift the front right corner of     the motherboard about 0 mm this allows it to clear the clear plastic power light guide slide the motherboard forward about 0 cm the motherboard then comes directly out  00 locate the 00 mhz clock crystal it is a small metal box near the     cpu chip note and remember its orientation the new clock oscillators must be aligned with pin 0 in the same orientation  very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator some of the pins may be bent over simply desolder then unbend them be sure your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board  i used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task this is not appropriate for a first soldering experience the motherboard is a multilayer design with very fine traces  easily damaged without proper care  00 install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was  00 put a 00 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket you could use the old clock but it has solder on its pins this may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problems later i suggest using a new 00 mhz clock  00 install your cooling fan system to complete the modification  00 reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place  00 snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother     board firmly plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard  00 reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 0 cm posterior of its intended position lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case     once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks     into place  00 reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables dontt forget the floppy     drive cable  00 replace the phillips head screw  00 drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in  00 plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount  00 reattach your cables and power cords cross your fingers and turn      on the mac it should make the usual power on chord if it doesnt something is amiss immediately turn of the power and recheck your handiwork if all is not well you have my sincere condolences  hopefully all will work normally turn the machine back off and replace the 00 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one reboot and be astounded   you will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding a particular speed is truly usable with my vso a machine lockup might take 0 hours of operation to occur in the brief time since modifying my clock oscillator 00 hours i have not had a single problem  good luck to all who attempt this modification there is a small but real risk but you could well reach quadra 000 speeds or higher with less than 00 in parts  guy kuo guykuouwashingtonedu

   the cd000 external is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile now  demand for the units are high so they are pretty rare  ive seen them   listed for around 000000 at local computer stores and the campus mac   reseller  ive also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of cds  i had mention in a previous article that i was searching for the 000 external drive  i did call apple catalog as recommended and they told me the drives were back ordered until may 0  i placed an order anyways and two days later i had a visit from federal express  well you can guess how i spent my weekend of course i ended up paying list price but you do get a free copy of pc exchange when you order from the apple catalog  you may want to check if they have any internal drives  btw an older version of gatekeeper i dont recall which version hung up my mac when trying to access a photocd or audio disk  i got the newer version which did mention a conflict with the apple 0xx cd driver

  my recently modified quadra 000 with a socket for clock oscillators has now completed nearly 00 hours of error free operation at 00 mhz with a 00 mhz clock oscillator i have also tried a 00 mhz cmos clock and that works as well on the more stupid side ive discovered you can use a 00 mhz clock and make your q000 as slow as a centris 000 however a 00 mhz clock which would have yielded a 000 mhz quadra 000 whod want one didnt work at all  impatiently awaiting a 00 mhz clock         guy kuo guykuouwashingtonedu

  i read in a recent tidbits0000 about the possibility of putting a 00000 in a pb000 i am interested in doing so but would like to know more about it does it involve just replacing the 00000 that is on the daughterboard or does it involve getting a new daughter board also would the 00000 be able to run qt with the pb000s screennot pretty i know but possible and of course what would the damage be  any info would be appreciated thanks in advance jay fogel

   yes i know computers and harddisk drives should be always on but what about monitors they generate a lots of heat should i or shouldnt i keep them on 00 hours a day any advice thanks take carepaul   i vote for turning them off at night  the stress of offon is a little  harmful so dont turn it off then back on an hour later etc but turning them off for 00 hours or overnight is a good idea  the electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight along with heat   we have a lot of 00year old machines in the basement that still work but who cares they are off 00 hours a day    
  stubbshawkcsukansedu jerry stubbs writes  the electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight  along with heat  i wonder how hard it would be ie what it would add to the cost to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than some amount of time  this is pretty standard in portable machines and the same kinds of tricks could be played spinning down disks turning off screens reducing clock speed etc  the advantage of this over just turning the thing off would be 0 you dont have to remember to do anything and 0 the machine is still available over the network  the tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity certainly you dont want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody pinged you but you do want to wake up at least the cpu if somebody logs in via a telnet connection  i wouldnt worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter months that energy is just getting turned into heat  it may not be as efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant but its not too bad  in the summer though its a disaster  not only are you wasting that power but youre probably also running the air conditioning to get rid of the waste heat   roy smith roynyuedu hippocrates project department of microbiology coles 000 nyu school of medicine 000 first avenue new york ny 00000 this never happened to bart simpson

   i wonder how hard it would be ie what it would add to the cost to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than some amount of time  i believe that apple sun and a number of other desktop machine manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate powersaving techniques  this is also something that governments in other countries are likely to require in the future so expect to see it  this may include the ability for the system to fully power down the monitor via a controllable power outlet and power it back on automatically  is this a sell on screen saver software companies  goals for idle power consumption have been set at something like 00 watts for the system not including the monitor  dont quote me on this  note that in many businesses the savings will be substantial especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for the night would save the company sun itself on the order of 0m per year  putting other and automatic powersaving features in would probably have greater than double that value  given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and home computers on getting faxes automatically getting email  building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to cut 0 off the national power consumption based on data i heard  btw when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving work it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors with the power switch on front  there was some indication that monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate lots of power cycling  this may only apply to the monitors we use but might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in back

     yes i know computers and harddisk drives should be always on but what about  monitors they generate a lots of heat should i or shouldnt i keep them on  00 hours a day any advice thanks take carepaul    there has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement  true  there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage but  the internal power supply is wellprotected ive turned my mac on and off   six or seven times a day for three years without problem  the monitor is  the same  to leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity  twice as much  as a television possibly more  the computer itself uses far less electricity than a tv  monitordepends on the size   but one thing not to do is use a selfshutdown or powershutdown  ironappliance on the same electric line  after a new monitor and power supply and modem my wife still doesnt think her iron is at fault she should know better being a biomed engineer   brett  theres nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as an intellectual conviction  sean ocasey in the white plague by frank herbert

  i was reading a review of the centris 000 in this  months macworld and the reviewer said that for  0 you could make an adjustment on the clock speed of the chip and change it from 00mhz to 00mhz  i  havent heard of this before and i dont think that this is the 000 chip replacement with fpu that i have seen so much talk about  anyone have any ideas cweraduedu      
  the article was probably referring to changing the clock oscillator in a manner similar to that done on quadra 000s and iisis i havent read a report of this actually being done on a centris 000 but supposedly this also works on q000 q000 and centris 000 machines  
  heres the scoop  for the past two years i have been using an se00 with a sony 0000s and a lapis video card  this past month i bought a quadra 000 and am now  using the sony on it  my se00 has been shipped home to my father who is planning on getting an apple 00 monitor the trinitron one  my question is this  what kind of power cord will he get with the apple monitor  does it come with two types  as i recall one can hook up the power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my  quadra 000  however for my fathers se00 there is no extra plug which allows use of the se00s power supply  he needs to plug it into the socket separately  sodoes the monitor come with a cable that will allow him to do this  will have to buy a different cable  if yes where can he purchase such a cable or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables  thanks in advance derek        derek fong                              email thewhoplumemitedu   dept of physical oceanography                 thewhodarlawhoiedu  bldg 000000a                           clark laboratory 000 massachusetts institute of technology   woods hole oceanographic institution cambridge ma 00000                     woods hole ma 00000 000 0000000                          000 0000000 x0000

      the origional bit is missing but longshort follows      the origional poster asked if heshe could use any old vgasvga monitor with a centris hence title        the answer ot this question is an unqualified yes  you can use any old vgasvga monitor with a centris  you do need an adaptor i use a mac vgaq from james engineering 000 0000000 to run between the two machines  the adaptor i have mentioned will convert a centris to a three row vgasvga 00 pin adaptor for your monitor      now the special interest disclaimer  the above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 000x000 resolution  if your monitor will sync to 00khz horizontal the above adaptor will allow you to choose 000x000 resolution i prefer this on my 0000s  then you have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates  i would advocate calling james engineering because they seem to have a clue  as to the comment by the person who said dont bother calling apple because they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue     apple will treat you like a fking assanine idiot for even considering going third party and if you want this treatment wants you to pay for their thech support line the supposedly compitantly one and then still has no fu clue  personal experience  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers doesnt see to extend to macs sony magnavox  in addition to this to find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the sync rates elsewhere as ads like hardware that fits  that rate monitor resolutions give the most favorable rating which usually means you can get this if you use a specialized application video cardie well you can get a resolution 0000x000 on this 0  0 super smelly sock monitor that will let you display two full pages side by side  all you need is our reasonably priced oder eater video board for 00000 and it will give you an ultra fast horizontal sync rate of six fast kilohertz and three khz vertical    note  with the sony 0000 at least on the centris 000 built in video board using an 000x000 adaptor there is a boarder of an inch  to the sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as possible  using a 000x000 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an inch                                                                      a

  hi do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture   apple uses in the powerbook duos  or in the powerbook in general  what are the factors that make the duo 000 so slow compared to a desktop   machine running the same processor at the same speed 00mhz 00000  how many   wait states are in the memory system etc  what kind of a data bus does it   use  00bit or 00bit    its still slow when plugged into a duodock  anyone know in general what kind of shortcuts notebook manufacturers take when   making notebooks  i heard of a 000dx000 notebook getting a whopping 00   mips rating  a similar desktop machine should be getting about 0 times that   i guess  avery  
  we are having a problem with a quadra 000 that has stumped a couple of techs sent to us by the vendor as well as us  this quadra is stuffed with 00mb ram 0mb vram and some large disk 000mb i think what happens is that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry loses vertical sync it is quite apparent that the mac cpu is still ok and the problem really seems to lie with the video circuitry since you can still save your documents quit your aplpications even pull down menus etc only the display is scrolling lik crazy so its pretty hard to hit menu items  we had the original logic board replaced twice now and the same problem has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has varied the first board had this problem every about 0hr more often if the cache was turned off yes off  this is the only symptom that is not obviously related to the video circuitry after all the cache is on the cpu right the second board had the problem every about 00 minutes we did not keep it rather we put the original back the current board we have has this problem a lot less often has gone about a week without doing it but did it twice within an hour yesterday the technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty sharp and tried a number of sensible things most of which we had previously tried ourselves anyway these included swapping the ram swapping the vram swapping monitors 0 different 00 apple rgb and 0 00 apple rgb swapping cables disconnecting hd and booting from floppy sacrificing various small mammals here are some other facts when we put a rasterops procolor 00 on the nubus the problem is fixed  it does not occur with the internal video or the procolor video out the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards  that exhibit it in our lab apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards  that they cannot find anything wrong with and getting them shipped back as  faulty according to us here are some speculations i bet that neither apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that  much ram and vram on them simultaneaously which may have something to do  with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem though we can  reproduce it with just 0mb of ram so this is probably a red herring the vendors representative blames metal in your walls  claims that our  walls have metal in them which interferes with the macs operation we  have another 000 in the lab which works like a charm though its not in  the exact same spot please dont tell me this is probably it i do  not want to believe it its probably not poltergeists since they do not have badges to get past  security at the entrance to our site  has anyone any ideas please please email as well as posting cause i seem to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less time available to read news  thank you in advance carlo tiana nasa ames research center carlovisionarcnasagov   carlocvsrochesteredu       carlowhitestanfordedu         we always remember you have a choice carlovisionarcnasagov

   a friend of mine recently acquired an 000 gc card for his iisi  and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white  i know there have been numerous reports about the worth of  the gc but i was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little  more on the subject  any replies encouraged  thanks in ad  vance  you may have been emailed this but the iisis power supply is not rated to handle the gc board  remember when the si came out and everyone complained about its power supply  this is one result of apple providing a lowcost computer and i think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end computer at the time anyways that couldnt even support their own video board  even if this isnt what is causing your problems you might develop one later  eric  
  bredelltdbuuse mats bredell writes  it was a paper from apple sweden that announced some new products the new docking station was only one of them and the paper arrived before it showed up on the price list i dont know if its still called the duodock plus in the price list it could be a mistake by someone at apple sweden      ah ok i didnt realize that you were talking about an apple division other than appleus appleus being the main division is the one that contains what most people feel are the correct names and configurations for the majority of apple customers and it is generally assumed that you are talking about appleus when you just say apple at least thats how it has always been in this newsgroup all other apple divisions are apparantly free to change names and configurations if they feel like it i know that apple canada does this kind of stuff all the time its not a mistake its apple sweden giving a different name to an apple product other than what appleus calls it  hades

  gary sager gsagerheliacalengsuncom wrote   btw when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving work it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors with the power switch on front  there was some indication that monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate lots of power cycling  this may only apply to the monitors we use but might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in back  im not an expert but having spent much too much of my life looking for the power switch or the brightness control or the degauss etc etc etc it is my firm belief that the only reason any controlsswitchesknobswhatever in places where they are hard to reach is because the designers put them there deliberately  the real question is weather this is because of stupidity or maliciousness    charles herbig unable to locate coffee  operator halted masc0000ucssun0sdsuedu

  the most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than the smaller one if your running the drive on a mac i would recommend a shareware utility called timedrive which tests seek scsi throughput and rotational speed this utility should let you know what the differences are between the drives   the views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only  bbs number000 0000000      maccontent is victoriaus first iconic bbs   larger drives tend to have multipule platters which can allow adjacent bits to be read in parallel resulting in higher throughput  they also have higher spindle speeds which leads to both increased throughput and reduced seek times due to reduction of rotational latency  erik speckman

  has anyone heard of a scsi device that can capture video   we need some sort of device that can capture about 00 frames or so per second and work off the scsi bus the idea is to use it for some sort of video conferencing application   if i told you all that went down it would burn off both your ears  these thoughts are only my own chbeckanlgov  
  i have the logitech hand scanner for the mac  it uses a scsi interface box that the standard scanner unit plugs into  i have tried my friends ibm hand scanner with the scsi box and it works  see if you can get logitech to sell you the scsi box by itself  warning  most of the cost of mac handscanners is contained in the scsi interface box so it could run up to around 000  when i upgraded my old style scanner to the new gray scale model it cost 00 they just gave me a new scan head and software the box was the same  the gray scale scanner  interface runs about 000 making it around 000 for the interface  collin   
  i recently bought a pli 00mgbyte floptical drive and i was very happy  with it until i tried to use it to format a 00 hd diskette i put the hd floppy in my superdrive to check that the floptical had formatted it correctly and now my superdrive refuses to recognize any floppy it says this disk is unreadable and asks if i want to format it even original systems floppies from apple nor will it format the disks if i try to initialization failed  strangely enough the floptical still reads both the 00 mb and 00 hd disks but i cant look at my 000k floppies and if i have a crash im screwed because the floptical cant be used as a startup disk  pli has been unresponsive  any ideas has this happened to anyone before i was looking for an inexpensive storage solution and now i am looking at an expensive repair  help respond to this thread or email mfeldmanacsbuedu

  i have done several of these upgrades about 0 iisis and 0 quadra 000 and the best thing to use would be some sort of heat sink compound if possible you should look for the siliconfree stuff theres a comany who makes the stuff called tech spray their address is po box 000 amarillo tx 00000  you should be wary in using most kinds of tape and definately dont use duct tape  that stuff is for ducts  when using the heat sink glue or compound only use enough to fill the small space between the heat sink and the cpu  mario murphy   from planet bmug the firstclass bbs of bmug  the message contained in  this posting does not in any way reflect bmugs official views   
  i believe that that would be the same as a system error 00 since there is no error 00 then i would guess that it would be a 00 error which is a font manager error of error during font declairation  i would assume that the system thats on the floppy that you are trying start up on has a corrupted font in it or something like that  mario murphy   from planet bmug the firstclass bbs of bmug  the message contained in  this posting does not in any way reflect bmugs official views

    the us environmental protection agency has formed an alliance  with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy  efficient pcs that power down automatically when not being used  this is a bad idea my machine is on 00 hours a day but its actually  doing things 00 hours a day i use it as an all purpose alarm clock  scheduler ive got routines that run in the middle of the night phone  calls it makes during the day when im out if your machine is on 00 hours  a day then you can count on it to be working 00 hours a day i could call  it from work and download a file that i might need i could call it from  work and have it turn the lights on if im going to be late oops more  wasted electricity  but conversely i could have it turn the lights  off heck i suppose i could even connect the microwave and have dinner  ready when i get there  oh well nevermind im just babbling  
  hi  i own a iisi and im considering buying a powerbook  can anyone give me a listing of all the models and tell me what im looking for ie passive matrix vs active memory sizes upgradeability internal modems disk size  if you could provide some prices too that would help  im not informed enough on powerbooks to know how well they operate   i have been following the posts on some of the problems that have been encountered such as the trackball not working in the horizontal i would appreciate the list as well as any advice you may have  thanks in advance kordi a wichita state university

  re the 00mhz iisi  i used the radio shack heat sink compound solution with no clamps works fine the caution holds though dont tilt your mac  
  ive been playing with a centris 000 0000 for the last couple weeks  the only problem that i have seen is that a couple of the applications i run are incompatible with the 000s processor cache so i have to run with it turned off actually the main thing i dont like it is that it doesnt have a software poweruppowerdown and the power switch is directly under the floppy drive  i havent hit it thinking it would eject the disk but some tired night im going to be really upset with that design decision  in all no problems with it floppy and printing have been just fine  printing is done across a localtalk net not a directly connected printer  bill

  so what does the net think did the dealer just get one flaky machine or did apple send the c000 out the door too early is your c000 working just great or is it buggy too  my 000 is working like a charm in fact if 000s are flaky i would consider it a great computer even if i had to return a couple to apple to get a good one     samuel christian zehrzeh0midwayuchicagoedu bio computing labswhitman 000 000 e 00th stchicago il 00000

  in the last two weeks i have the following problem on two 000s  0 has a 0mb simm and the other a 0 mb simm both are about 0 0 months old bought from different vendors and installed by different people   both computers begin crashing frequently locking up and ultimately the memory chimes  crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen and sometimes would occur when you werent even touching the computer  in both cases taking the machine apart taking the memory out and putting it back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback  my marginally educated guess as to whats happening is that larger simms are lopsided in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after time they begin to move about  possible because of pressure on the keyboard or something    anyway has anyone else had such a problem or solution  if somehow you could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving  ive had no problem for the past 0 weeks by replacing my 0mb simm with a 0mbsimm although this is not desireble solution  please email any resp  andor post if usefull to the rest of the world  ted    ted schreiber mechanical enginering  northwestern university tel 0000000000 fax 0000000000 email rtsnwuedu

   according to what i saw in a store today the performa 000 is not the same as an lciii  it only has a 00mhz 00000 while the lciii has a 00mhz 000 correct me if i am wrong because it is possible that the dealer may have forgotten to remove the description that was next to the actual computer dealers who sell the performa are known to have about as much knowledge about macs as i do about dos machines  saurabh

  i thought id share a good experience too  i bought the aps quantum 000 zero footprint drive in may 00 back when they still used two separate leds on the front panel and the case was metal  while traveling with it it was in my se00 mac bag on top of the mac this past winter one of the plastic tabs holding the front panel on broke so that the right side of the front panel was coming forward away from the rest of the drive  i lived with this situation until it became completely intolerable which more or less coincided with a network shutdown at school and a trip out of town i had to take which gave me some dead time during which to have the drive sent out  i called aps for an rma  and got one with no questions asked about how the tab got broken it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers  though nothing else was damaged well except for the internal speaker in my modem which wasnt that well glued down to begin with  yeah yeah im never flying with my se00 again  and when i called back to ask whether i could send it in a little later rather than right away they had no problem with that  even when i exceeded the normal valid period for an rma  by a day theyre usually good for 00 days  the front panel was replaced under warranty and the drive was shipped back quickly i mailed it first class insured on a saturday by noon from la to missouri and it came back by fed ex by friday i dont know exactly what day it came back because i was traveling that week from wednesday afternoon to sunday afternoon  the only thing that couldve been bad was that the first service rep i talked to in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data suggested that i take the drive mechanism out and send just the case  unfortunately i discovered the day i was mailing the thing that would necessitate breaking the little seal and thus voiding the warranty  oh well  al albertseasuclaedu  
  well      you can always try and find a pc dealer who sells guaranteed memory i work at a company growing at 00 a year we have on order hundreds of computers per year  it never fails machines come in with bad simms now for those of you who are wondering just why your pc or mac just crashed i can tell you i always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or designed the software     well i dont think that way anymore especially with the results i have gotten with replacing bad simms in my own machine and others at work the moral to this story is to make sure your memory is good  i would be willing to bet lots of you out there have simms with either soft or hard errors on them and you dont even know about it but every once in awhile those bad simms just makes your life hell     i just got plain sick of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine just crashed and they lost thier work  in case your wondering or if you havent already guessed i work in an is department  service is a do or die perogative in this line of work so the moral is  have your memory tested with a simm hardware testerand no i dont mean the simple little software programs that you can run in your machine  simms are complicated little beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively  if any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices which are not cheap write me back  they make life a little bit easier and besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity people would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide  greg carter    
  according to the official documentation failure to use the iifx terminator can not only affect scsi bus performance but can also damage the bus whether this is your problem or not i dont know i have had sporadic scsi problems with my iifx since i bought it i cannot connect more than three devices fourth one causes major problems  first thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system if you continue to get errors it is probably the drive if it formats fine then i would try to format it on your system with no externals if this  fails then the scsi controller on your iifx needs repairreplacement  hope this helps     david c salmon salmonunomahaedu  have you tried having your scsi bus balanced  greg

  in article tecot000000000xenonstanfordedu tecotxenonstanfordedu edward m tecot writes a professor of mine once said the difference between a computer engineer and a computer scientist is about 0000 meaning the engineer makes 0000 more than ps the 0000 is not just a joke scott  for the most part this is a bunch of bunk  ive got a computer engineering degree yet ive spent the last 0 years writing software that people actually use  moreover the salary distinctions are incorrect i received 0 job offers upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were 0000year lower  my advice is to decide which classes and projects most interest you and pick the major that allows you to take them  emt  well here is my 000 worth  advice from a grad student  i agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me the important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and  learn as much as possible about it    in my five years of education in this field though brief  compare to alot of people i had to think about this kind of  question a lot  did i make the right decision in going into electrical engineering as opposed to computer engineering or cs  the more i go thru school the more i believe that this kind of question is irrelevant              interesting as i think computer technology is now becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position which must require a degree  i know of several people i work with that make just as much as i do and they dont even have a bs degree in comp sci yet they make 00 a year  they also didnt have to pay 00 grand to thier local university either         i think computer programming is being reduced to a trade practice than a truly specialty field  it will be even more so in the future        if your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you choose cs as i did i suggest checking out the emerging field of software engineering  the difficulties for example of designing scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person can handle 000000 to 0000000 million lines of code all by himself in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment is truly a gigantic problemnot going to be solved any time soon unfortunatelybut hey you could be the person that provides the missing key for some good groundwork  i have come to believe that choosing cs because one  does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something  everything is interwoven and inseparable  cs ce and ee are all a  part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other  my advice is dont limit yourself but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to  learn  that of course depends on the curriculum at your  persective school  i would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible  beside i dont know why the school would make a student choose a major before herhis sophamore year                    hey you may be so interested in this field that you  decided to learn all about the making of computers in which  case you suffer a little more and go to grad school  about the money  dont look at the averages if you are good you are going to earn more money than anyone else  if you are a superstar programmer you will earn millions   like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers          well if your like the poor slobs in the worldlike me you are in no financial position to continue graduate work right out of a top 00 comp sci school  the trick is to find some generous inc you work for to pay for the rest of your educationtrust me its the best way to goeven if you dont get a top salary  which i have always been a poor slob throughout school but if you follow this rule booksalaryfoodshelter you should always have a computer and you wont go hungry  what else could a man want     chung yang   greg carter

    hey all  we have an old 0000 external hd attached to the plus in our lab  it had   given us flawless service until last week  the problem someone in our lab   has an old 000 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a plus with an   aftermarket simmscsi setup digigraphics simmer  the db00 scsi plug runs   through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 00pin   rectangular connector  well this guy had removed the back from the machine   to put more memory in and had disconnected the the scsi plug  since the   00pin connector is symmetrical not keyed he may have reinstalled it upside   down essentially reversing the pins on the db00  he came in and asked if he   could try out our hd on his scsi port it had never been used  naive fools   that we are we said ok  his computer failed to recognize the drive  now   none of the computers in our lab will recognize it  we tried disk doctor and   it doesnt recognize anything on the scsi chain  could installing the scsi   upside down have wrecked the hds driver board  the drive seems to spin up   all right and unpark itself upon powerup  the events are too coincidental to   attribute the problem to stiction  any help greatly appreciated  james jakfffchemutahedu  next mail

  i ordered an external floppy drive from them 0 years ago  when i placed the order they said it was in stock and would ship the next day  a week passed and no drive  i called them up and they said they were out of stock and my drive should ship in 0 weeks or so  since i needed the drive right away both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead i cancelled my order and havent dealt with them since   chris kidwell ck00andrewcmuedu   i too had a very unpleasant experience with hardware thats shi it featured repeated lies about when things had shipped a salesperson who was totally ignorant about what he was selling a charge for duties i had specifically been assured were not payable and then a monitor their house brand 0page monochrome that was the most unadulterated piece of junk it has ever been my misfortune to experience in the world of electronics  i shipped it back and they refunded my money but it still cost me something over 000 for long distance charges nonrefundable taxes and duties and lost time  dont deal with them

  i believe apple has a patent on the region features of quickdraw  a mac clone would have to implement regions  this is why apples comment was that they believe it is not possible to make a mac clone without infringing on their patents  they may have other patents like this  apple has patented their implementation of regions which presumably includes the internal data structure which has never been officially documented by apple  apple cannot patent the concept of a region  im guessing that either nutek reverseengineered apples internal data structure for regions i dunno if this would hold up in court or they came up with their own data structure  if its the latter then they wont be able to draw pict files containing regions  besides pict files there arent many places where regions are stored on disk  quicktime movies perhaps  as long as the region isnt being stored on disk and transferred from a mac to a nutek clone or vice versa it doesnt matter if nutek uses a completely different internal data structure  i remember reading that apple also has a patent on their adb hardware and that the nutek clones would therefore be lacking an adb port  what other patents does apple have on the mac   joe schwartz       email xoracmrpiedu  or  xorclothoacmrpiedu mapinfo corp 000 broadway       these are my own opinions  any similarity to the troy ny 00000     opinions of mapinfo corporation is purely coincidental

  jbr0cbnewscbattcom josephabrownlee writes  could someone post a definitive answer about the vram configuration   for the  q000 and presumably the c000 and c000 as well  there seems to be a   lot of  confusion about this issue  id like to know           what kind of simms are the vram simms ie 00pin etc  theres only one physical size for vram simms unlike dram simms which  come in many many sizes and pinouts although they do come with  differing amounts of vram on them  the ones you need are 000kb simms are  organized as 000k x 00 and have two 000k x 0 vram chips on them  this is  the only size which the quadra and centris machines can use          how many vram simm slots are there  two          what rules if any must be followed in filling the slots eg in                  pairs sizes must match etc  both simm slots must be filled putting a simm in only one slot does  nothing for you          how fast must they be  00 ns for the q000 and c000 000 ns for the c000          is there any other relevant information  there are certain vram chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible  with the quadra and centris video hardware  make sure that the source you  get them from guarantees compatiblity  in general if it works in a q000 it will work in a q000   please dont reply unless you have the correct information  many   thanks in  advance for helping to eliminate some noise from this group  trust me     dale adams   apple computer inc

  as i said i know a multisession cdrom is necessary if you do more photos but what if it is just a writable cdrom drive and do a second session do you need one for that too  if you write a second time to a cd you need to have multisession capability to read the second session  whether it is photos or just data or whatever  here is a simplified way of looking at it the first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks  the second session has a newer directory structure but the first directory still exists because you cannot change only add  so if you put that in a normal drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data  multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc older systems look only for the directory not taking multiple directories into account  lex van sonderen philips interactive media  
  approximately four months ago i purchased a quantum 000lps hd from la cie for 000 after two months the drive started having problems first there were intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then silverlining 000 wouldnt even recognize the drive so i got an rma from la cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one  well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems often when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark sometimes if i then insert the silverlining 000 program i can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives at that point i can restart the iisi and boot from the hd ive called la cie again and theyve given me another rma their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesnt see the drive theres a definite hardware problem  given that this is the second bad drive in four months i asked la cie to send me a new one but they said no also within three weeks after i purchased my original drive la cie dropped the price on it by over 000  i can accept that a drive or two may be bad and i know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs and i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations nevertheless taken together the convergence of these factsevents have left a bad taste in my mouth i should have added above that when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will sendi think the data is still in good shape and ill have to again reinstall everything from floppiesthey said it would cost me 000 for data recovery  it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still covered under a 00day warranty should be new   i feel a little helpless about all this i dont mean to necessarily flame la cietheir support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful but cmon sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way i sent a letter to la cies customer service when the first drive was returned and i asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price i told them i would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another la cie product they didnt even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other  whats the moral of this story im not sure but i do know i wont buy any other products from la cie in the future  bill krauthammer f0ehg000umiamiirmiamiedu  ps please dont email or post about how good your la cie product and service has been im not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that all im saying is that ive had a disappointing experience with them and ill be taking my business elsewhere in the future

     there isnt any copyright equivalent of the res ipsa doctrine  but theres something kind of similar  to show infringement one  element you need to show is that the defendant copied from your work  if youre lucky youll have direct evidence of copying  the smoking  gun  normally you do this through circumstantial evidence by showing  evidence of access from which one might reasonably infer copying  this evidence of access is considered along with the similarities  between the two works in deciding whether you copied  however if  the similarities are so strong as to be striking an inference of  copying may be drawn even without any evidence that the defendant had  access to your copyrighted work    in that case the burden will be on the defendant to rebut the inference  of copying  for example evidence that hed been on a desert island for  the last ten years and had no contact with civilization    wow now we know why lawyers are rich and computer scientists are poor lawyers have to sound as if they understand this stuff

   my advisor has decided to get a mac for the lab now that we are funded again  the consensus in the lab was that all we really needed was an lciii but  he decided he wanted a centris 000  the lack of an fpu on that machine and the price struck me as making it worth less than an lciii so i have  suggested we get a iivx instead  it seems heavily expandable and for   what do people with iivxs think of them  they seem like good machines to me and i like the nubus slots in case we ultimately decide we want to do work with video on it  the iivxlciii performance at a centris 000 price the only reason to get an iivx is if you really need the fullsize nubus slots keep  in mind that the 000 supports all apple monitors and has optional ethernet this lessens but doesnt eliminate the need for nubus cards and unless youre running fpuintensive software the 000 will blow the doors off the lciii and the iivx the lciii on the other hand is sufficient for most people and has a great price  if you havent guessed i find halving the bus clock the iivx 00mhz up vs 00mhz bus a throughly bad thing and i hope apple never does it again    joe finete                                                                    jfinetecatsucscedu                                                           
  does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to apples specs that forces the external output on lcs and the powerbooks 000000 and duo 000 into a true vga style output signal the nec adapter does not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into the correct pinout but do not switch the macs output into vga mode  do i have to make one of these or does someone already have one madeup  the following is the apple spec for the lc cpu vga cable adapter im assuming that the powerbooksduos will work with the same adapter   macintosh lc to vga   the macintosh lc can supply a 000 x 000 vga timed signal for use with vga monitors by using an adapter cable  the standard macintosh lc supports vga to 00 colors and with the optional 000k vram simm the vga monitor is supported to 000 colors   note     the macintosh lc supplies signals capable of driving ttl level           inputs  however some low impedance input vga monitors do not work           with the macintosh lc   to connect a macintosh lc to a vga monitor you need to make an adapter cable from the macintosh lc video connector to the vga monitor  following is the pinout description for the adapter cable   macintosh lc        vga video connector     pin     signal name           0                   0       red ground 0                   0       red video signal 0                   0       green video signal 0                   0       green ground 0                   0       blue video signal 00                  0       blue ground 00                  00      hsync 00                  00      vsync 00                  00      hsync ground 000                nc      sense0  sense0 tied together   vga monitors are identified by shorting pin 0 to pin 00 on the macintosh lc video connector  the macintosh lc grounds pin 0 on its video connector which results in pulling down pin 00 and gives the correct monitor id for a vga monitor   this message was created on mcw bbs a jointly supported by new orleans mac user group  national home  school user group usermaccomwuucp        the views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only

    i have a radius precision color 00x video card for the mac that fits in a  nubus slot  the card has 0 mb of vram on it which means that 00bit color  is possible on the card  the card supports just about any monitor scan rate you can think of i used it at 000x000 000x000 and 0000x000 but it can go higher  you can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a software control panel    this is the accelerated version of the card which means all quickdraw  calls are not executed by the cpu but taken over by the video card freeing up the mac processor for other tasks     the cheapest i could find this card for when i called around last night was 0000 at macs place  i will sell it for 0000  shipping  it is just over a year old and never been any problem  it comes with software and the original manuals    hurry  chris magnuson chrismcolhpcom hewlettpackard company 000 0000000

   another thing why a scsi interface   because scsi works well with removable media and works well with large capacity devices the floppy interface you suggest handles the former but it doesnt have any hooks for dealing with the latter youd have to kludge it plus its extremely low performance and scsi has gobs of room for expansion compared with a floppy i can just see it lets stick a 000 a 00 a tape drive and a mo drive all on the floppy interface the possibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous   peter da silva                                             network management technologies incorporated               u  00000 west airport blvd  sugar land tx  00000  usa 0 000 000 0000                            zure otsoa besarkatu al duzu gaur  
   well i just got my centris 000 yesterday  it took just over two  weeks from placing the order  the dealer rutgers computer store  appologized because apple made a substitution on my order  i ordered the one without ethernet but they substituted one with ethernet he wanted to know if that would be alright with me  they must be backlogged on centri wout ethernet so theyre just shipping them with    anyway im very happy with the 000 with a few exceptions   being nosy i decided to open it up before powering it on for the first time  the scsi cable to the hard drive was only partially connected must have come loose in shipping  no big deal but i would have been pissed if i tried to boot it and it wouldnt come up the hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine  ive heard apple will exchange it if you complain so i might try to get it swapped i am also dissappionted by the lack of soft poweronoff  this wasnt mentioned in any of the literature i saw  also the location of the resetinterupt buttons is awful  having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient oh and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on powerup ive seen this mentioned by others so it must be afeature anyway above all its fast  a great machine at a great price  gnelsonphysicsrutgersedu

    whether the drive is hooked up to the computer or not the lps000 makes a disk seek noise every 00 seconds  this is consistent  and will continue as lomg as the drive is powered up  even if  i disconnect the drive from the computer this drive activity continues at 00 second intervals  someone tried to tell me the drive was doing a thermal recalibration  not knowing beans about the internal physical workings of the lastest disk drive technology i guess i might believe anything  whats the scoop on this standalone drive activity every 00 sec  i can only comment on thermal recalibration in general some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes basically the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance since when the media heats up or cools down some track drift is inevitable and the drive has to monitor it this becomes especially critical at very high recording densities and so was used primarily on very largecapacity mechanisms but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drives longterm reliability and mtbf ratings  i first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing say audio or video to hard disk some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are not to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes  hope this helps  victor

  f0ehg000umiamiirmiamiedu writes  it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a  discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still  covered under a 00day warranty should be new    well sounds like we need some kind of a lemon law on the hardware industry  after all it does sound unfair to me for someone that has paid the price of a new drive for a reconditioned one  what do you guys think  
  is it me my 000 or all 000s  it doesnt seem to broken  it isnt making grinding noises or anything its just loud  much louder that the fan in the iici i just sold  anybody else have this problem  how about a solution  is there a good replacement fan thats a lot quieter but moves the same air  any easy way to insulate the sound but not the cooling air  hah  i cant even hear the fan on my 000gee i wonder if its workingyup just checked its exhausting air out the back just fine  gary     gary snow uunetclarkgsnow  or  gsnowclarkedu

  i want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 0 megabytes  sec for very large data transfers  around 0 mb  i have a quadra 000  i have a nubus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 00 mbs          using blockmode transfers i have a highspeed disk array no asynchronous pb calls that can          achieve 00 mbs  lets say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card  it is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer then transfer all the data from the buffer to card  00 mbs then 00 mbs result in an overall 00 mbs  too slow  so i tried the following scheme for an nmegabyte transfer   step 0                                load the 0st mb from disk to buffer step 0 asynch send 0st mb out card   load the 0nd mb from disk to buffer step 0 asynch send 0nd mb out card   load the 0rd mb from disk to buffer          step n asynch send the n0 mb out card load the nth mb from disk to buffer step n0 send the nth mb out card  even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously and the card does not use the mac cpu at all  it is using the buffer tho each of the steps 0 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another  so there is no improvement in the rate  why  is the mac ram dualport  so the nubus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time is the problem that the two devices card and disk driver both have to use the same bus to mac ram  is there anything i can do  david   david blume             i get tired thinking of all the things i    dcbwdl0wdlloralcom   dont want to do  bukowski barfly

    first this is not an april 0 joke    a dealer in my town told me that the powerbook dont sell as they use to sell  the guy told me that apple is having the same problem it has when the desktop  mac was too expensive   the powerbook are too expensive in comparison to what  you can get on the dos side what do you think of this do you feel the same  thing about it just curious  sounds about right  if there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to aggresively cut prices  once the demand fall off a bit then is the time to start getting aggressive with pricing  waiting too long can really hurt your business though   the powerbooks have sold very well up to now if they are slowing down apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions the only reason i own a powerbook is that i could spring for a 000 pb000 the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me  id bet theyll be coming out with more power versions too    michael peirce         peirceoutpostsfbayorg   peirce software        suite 000 000 hibiscus place                          san jose california usa 00000   makers of             voice 000 0000000 fax 000 0000000              smoothie    applelink peirce  america online afc peirce  
  heres a question that may be simple enough to answer but has stumped myself and a few others  what does an external ram cache card do for you if you already have a large cache set through control panel in your simms  ex  i have a mac iici with 00 meg ram an external video card so i dont rob my simms and the default apple cache card i believe this is 00k  say i have my cache set at 0 meg what good does a measly 00k do me on the cache card  could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the simms  or does it still speed things up by providing a secondary staging area for data normally passed directly into the simm ram cache  im confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself  yet daystar fastcache has numbers which show around a 00 performance boost on some operations  are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most simm accesses  please help im trying to find the optimum memory settings for the iici system described in the ex above  patrick hurhfnalfnalgov  
   hello all i am thinking about buying an external monitor for my se00 and was wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me i am mostly thinking about a 00 color monitor and an 0 bit card that can switch between 000000 and something higher like 000000  i read an old report on a card from lapis that could do this but could not use the external monitor as the main screen with menubar which to me is a major draw back  has this perhaps been fixed or can any other cards do this like the micron xceed  also which monitor should i buy  at the moment i am leaning towards the sony 0000 0000s or 0000 what exactly is the difference between these but are there any other good cheap monitors i should know about  doesnt the monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions  please send me email and ill summarize  i would also greatly appreciate getting the email addresses of any mail order companys that sell monitors or cards  thanks in advance  eggert thorlacius university of iceland  
   i believe that in order to get at the innards of the new mouse you must remove the label on the bottom that says apple desktop bus mouse ii  there you should find two screws on either side i havent tried it myself yet but when i ran my fingernail accross the label these two divots appeared and i can only assume that these are the elusive screws in question  cheers john   john m graham the cleveland institute of music jmg00pocwruedu brought to you by the letters j m and g and the number 00

  you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational prices   i would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices i went for a retailer actually mail order cda computers because its price was better thant the campus computer store i found out why later on when i tried to get a repair done at an apple registered repair center  the cpu was a resale the serial number had been removed and replaced with a nonstandard number probably from cda computers consequently the apple repair man could not do any warrenty repairs so i ended up with just a 00day warrenty from cda over the apple 00month warrenty boy was i pied moral of the story caveat emptor  however if you go with a reliable trustworthy mail order firm if they exist  maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences you will probably get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order out of state does not require sales tax yet though for how much longer remains to be seen the addition in sales tax on a cpu purchase will probably wipe out an educational discount again caveat emptor some mail order companies do include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state so check  richard    richard j appleyard  f0000000jaguarcscwsuedu  o o  washington state university        voice 000 0000000  fax 000 0000000   o  to err is human but to really screw things up takes a computer

   in the macuser article on the new centris and quadra machines mentioned that the c000 and the q000 and not the c000 had rom accelerated video  what is it  i dont recall seeing it in dale adams post  of course it was in dales post just not in the words that macuser  used  rom accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands has been rewritten inside the rom to take advantage of the 00000 addressing modes  commands that do fills should be slightly faster since the new instructions fetch 0 bytes at a time versus one

  ive just completed a successful upgrade of a an si to 000 mhz im waiting on delivery of a 00 mhz clock for a final speed trial definitely needed the heatsink the cpu was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until i glued on a 00 cent radio shack sink   i made a call for reports of failures last week no reports have arrived here locally in seattle there is a reported cpu damage due to the user slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board  not exactly a problem due to the cpu running too fast  i think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system configurations including pds and nubus cards which were used id be happy to coordinate and report results  guy kuo guykuouwashingtonedu

  the trackbal on my pb000 no longer moves in the horizontal direction  when i called the nearest authorized apple service person i was told that it probably needed replacing and that would cost me over 000  ouch   can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem  one strange symptom of the problem is that when i take the ball out of the socket and shine a light into the hole i can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the wheel with my finger it works fine that way but wont work if i turn off the light  any suggestions or comments  ben roy just a poor college studentinternetbr0000aamericanedu   ben  since youre obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works the only thing short of repairing it that i can think of is a thorough cleaning of all the parts and then checking for the proper placement of the little blue rollers since they arent fixed in position on their stainless steel pins you might try sliding them into a slightly different position on my powerbook 000 i can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball in fact one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its edge contacts the ball not the center cylindrical area  ive done this with my pb000 and it does seem to improve the feel but needs to be adjusted from time to time i just popped open one of our offices pb000s and while there isnt as much latitude for movement one could still adjust the roller slightly if your pb000 is the same it might help  i would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller if you can take it out clean it with a mild soapy solution or isopropyl  alcohol also be sure the ball is greasefree  if you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin   if all this still doesnt solve it then maybe a new one is in order  it could be an electrical connection in which case replacement would be necessary but my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem not an electrical malfunction  hope this helps  murray      murray m altheim      ils ont lorteil de bouc  dun chevreil loreille instructional consultant    la corne dun chamois  la face vermeille csu sacramento          comme un rouge croissant  dancent toute nuict altheimmcsusedu       dedans un carrefour ou pres dune eau qui bruict

   mind you this doesnt mean you shouldnt do it  the parts that can blow the adb power fuse and rf filter arent too expensive so if you have a someone around who can do componentlevel repair it may be worth the risk especially if youre around seattle cause you might get to pay me to fix it   on the other hand if your only repair option is the applestandard logic board swap major  you should probably play it safe   scsi yes adb yes floppies yes  they can all cause trouble  otoh some of us get lucky ive unplugged and replugged scsi and adb quite often and never blown anything  i blew out the adb by shorting the cable though    matthew t russottorussottoengumdedurussottowamumdedu some news readers expect disclaimer here just say no to police searches and seizures  make them use force not responsible for bodily harm resulting from following above advice

  okay i dont use it very much but i would like for it to keep working correctly at least as long as apple continues to make system software that will run on it if slowly   here is the problem  when the screen is tilted too far back vertical lines appear on the screen  they are every 00 pixels or so and seem to be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus it looks to a semitechnical person like there is a loose connection between the screen and the rest of the computer  i am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer or taking this one to the shop  i would also like to not have to buy one of larry pinas books  i like larry but im not sure i feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual for it  on a related note  what does the monitor connector connect to  erik

  i havent seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac we would like to try it and i wonder if someone had some good advice  we have a mac iicx with the original internal quantum 00mb hard disk and an unusable floppy drive we also have a new spare connor 00mb disk which we would like to use the idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk but there seems to be some problems  the internal scsi cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk drive  if i made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each 0 for motherboard 0 for each of the 0 disks would it work  is the iicx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk  what about terminators i suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard but leave them installed in the other disk  the scsi id jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets id 0 the old one should have id 0  it is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive as we have an external floppy that we can use if it wont boot of the hard disk  thank you   torbjrn rognes                            email rogntorbidtunitno  
  i am in the market for a 000m hard drive i have a iisi with 000 and i am almost all filled up is anyone selling any hds for the mac for cheap where can i get one through mail order and where is the best place to buy from for the best prices is there anyone on the net or on this newsgroup that sells them for wholesale or cheaper any info would be appreciated thanks  
   i own a mac iisi and am considering upgrades cards hard drive etc can you tell me what the power limitations are for 0 the pds slot and 0 the hard drive power feed secondly can you tell me if there is a separate limit for each or if instead there is a single limit for both combined  felix lin a new reader of compsysmachardware feilimaulelandstanfordedu

  the internal hd in my lc disappeared for a day last week and id like to hear any reasonable theories folks can suggest for what happened  it is an lc with 00mb of ram and an 00mb internal drive running system 00 with a few scsi devices in a so far as i know properly terminated chain  i had shut down the system for a day i was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year and upon restarting got a blinking question mark  i booted from a floppy and saw that my external hd seemed okay but there was no sign of the internal  i installed a system folder on the external and was indeed able to boot from it  i tried things like disk first aid and silverlining to inquire about the internal drive  they either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it silverlining claimed it was a connor drive but it is a quantum   well id backed things up so i was able to work  but at some point i noticed that the internal had reappeared  now disk first aid says that alls well etc  things seem to be fine  but what happened  was this a warning that something the internal hd or something else is about to die  im definitely nervous  and if this is a signal that the internal hd is sick is it true that i can only put up to a 000mb drive inside an lc  some folks have claimed theres a limitation in the lc othern size or power while others and that includes lacie over the phone say anything that fits is okay  thanks for answers

  i have an old mac plus a couple of years ago i bought a shiney new lc it came with apples new keyboard with abd ports i replaced it with a macproplus extended keyboard which i thoroughly enjoy thank you very much   well i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but theres a little problem the plus uses an rj00 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards dont i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer theyre such nice people but they couldnt tell me the order of the wires   there are four wires in the adb cables black white red tan i know ones a ground one gets the serial signal one supplies 0 volts and i forgot what the fourth one does anyway if you hook them up wrong youll fry a board and i really dont want to do that   if any brave souls out there have done this before please email your experience directly to me i would greatly appreciate it especially since apples original keyboard is not    ergonomically correct   btw i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj00 jack and the adb since it has both but no such luck the connections are soldered inside of little boxes oh well      one more thing in case you are thinking that the abd ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus youre right however you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the macproplus keyboard via its own rj00 jack in other words this little engineering feat i wish to do is possible its merely a matter of finding out the correct order   omt when i get this to work i definitely will post the solution so others can too thanx for the input      tis the blink of an eye tis the draught of a breath           from the blossoms of health to the paleness of death          from the gilded saloon to the briar in the shroud             o why should the spirit of mortal be proud                                                                   william knox     shagbergvmcmpilstuedu                                       
  i too have been watching the iisi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in the next few weeks  the plan i have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel switch  this way i can get the speed when i want but i can also run at slower stock speeds it i experience any compatability problems with any applications  i dont expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running but if i can switch without any lockup problems then i could switch to 00mhz when needed and put it back to idle 00 mhz when not needeed  this would further reduce the wearandtear on the cpu even with a heat sink  of course i would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and route it directly to the mother board  i havent started probing around inside my si yet  does anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilators    thanks     tom dickens  boeing computer services  tpd0000yakcaboeingcom      these statements are mine and not boeings

    xposted to compsysmachardware and miscconsumers   youve heard about apples great new customer support program  well think again  sometimes the only real support out there is what apple computer users can give to each other  for another example read on  in the march 00th issue of macweek ric ford described a twoyear effort by liam breck to document and bring to apples attention a problem with certain defective mice  at random the switches on these mice stick in the down position until clicked a second time apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in malaysia and have an fcc id of bcga00000 youll recognize this sticky button symptom immediately if you have such a mouse the problem is intermittent but its not subtle  liam breck recently gave up trying to document this problem and instead  suggested that people contact apples customer assistance center directly macweek 0000 p 00 when i called apple on march 00rd and described my defective mouse i was eventually given a case number f00y and told apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty  after waiting for three weeks i called back today wondering where my new mouse was this time i was told that apple had decided the serial number on my mouse mb00000fc00 is not within the undisclosed range apple is willing to replace and there is nothing i can do about it  nothing that is unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth apples while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice please if you have one of these mice i need your help dont assume you know what causes the problem there are lots of theories and start hacking around inside your hundreddollar mouse instead let apple do it please take five minutes to call apple right now at                    united states      00000000000                   canada             0000000000                   uk and europe      00000000000                   australia          0000000000                   japan and pacific  00000000000  if the number isnt tollfree call collect  describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse  even if they refuse insist that they register the details of your case including your mouses serial number  be firm  network managers and usergroup leaders especially please query your user bases everyone ask your friends and colleagues  please dont send mail to me or post yet another stickybutton report call apple directly  if enough victims take the trouble to report this wellknown problem apple will eventually be forced to respond  if apple continues to find it easy to stonewall on this issue dont expect them to offer support when the next potentially more serious mac defect is uncovered   bill sloan  
   hello all  for few past days ive been fighting to get my nec multisync 0d predecessor of 0fg to work properly with the internal video of mac iivi  with a vgaadapter as described in dale adams posting about quadra video it works only some minor interferences occur small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible  clear  but because the scanrates  stuff of 0d are well enough for emulating apple 00 rgb i first made an adapter then got one fron the local distributor of nec with both adapters i can get a picure which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then but with radical changes on screen opening palettes large windows etc there are major interferences in sync the picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally even when it is clear there are some spiky interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pulldowns etc with the selfmade adapter almost identical to the vga one only sense pins differ it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu with the adapter from nec everything is well most of the time but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost but not nearly as often as with the selfmade one  i know with self made adapters there can always be interference but with the one provided by nec wheres the source of this interference  ill give you the pinouts of the whole mess and i hope that you can at least someone please try  figure out what could be the best pin assignment for nec 0d i am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and isolations as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be arranged especially syncs and groundings  yes i have checked that the monitor is not defective it works perfectly well with all pc graphic adapters up to 0000x000 pixels and also atari 00hz monochrome which i am using now with it  here are the pinouts  stuff  00 pin mini dsub nec 0d00 pin dsub mac at least quadra  0  red video0  red gnd 0  green video0  red video 0  blue video0  composite sync 0  gnd0  sense 0 0  gnd0  green video 0  red gnd0  green gnd 0  green gnd0  sense 0 0  blue gnd0  nc 0  nc0  blue video 00 gnd00 sense 0 00 gnd00 csync  vsync gnd 00 nc00 vsync 00 hsync00 blue gnd 00 vsync00 hsync gnd 00 nc00 hsync shell gndshell gnd    connection suggested by apple for vgasvga sense pins changed to emulate apple 00 with multisync my selfmade adapter  multisync 00pin mini dsubmac 00pin dsub      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   00   00  00   00  00   00  00     0 sense0 grounded to 00 sync gnd   connection measured from an adapter to make nec 0fg0fg  emulate apple 00 adapter provided by nec representative  nec 00 mini   mac 00  0    0 0    0 0    0 0    shell gnd 0 0 0 00 0    same as above 0    same 0    same 0    same 00   same 00   same 00   0 00     not connected    well i am waiting for your solutions  and thanks   jartsu

  yes it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac iicx internally this is definitely not a recommended procedure by apple but i have done the equivalent to my cx after upgrading it to a quadra 000 the power supply is still the stock cxs and it was able to power two quantum lps drives a pli scsi  accelerator a micron technologies 00 bit video board daystar quickcache new technologies overdrive and 00 meg of ram simultaneously  i added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive tower the internal scsi cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto which i added an extra connector about midway the final hd was internally terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final hd had its terminator resistor packs removed cooling has not been a problem and no scsi problems occur with either the pli scsi chain or motherboard scsi hooked into the two internal hard drives  it works very well for me but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same   
  i have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 00 mhz clock and a higher speed clock oscillators outputs through a double throw switch to allow different  speeds there was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but if the si uses timing loops anything like a quadra for accessing its floppy drive dynamic switching will wreak havoc a quadra must reboot after having its clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its floppy drive

   when the computer is set for 000 colors and certain operations are done  particularly vertical scrolling through a window horizontal white lines  appear on the monitor which generally but not always spare open  windows  these lines accummulate as the operation is continued  if a  window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away  the line disappear from that area of the screen  this problem is not  observed if the monitor is configured for 00 colors or a 00 inch apple  monitor with 000 colors is used     i suspect a bad video ram chip but cannot be certain  the problem has  been apparent since day 0 but has gotten worse  im having exactly the same problem  again its fine when i switch to 00 colors or a smaller monitor  my configuration is  model centris 000 with 0 mb00 hd 000 vram no cards monitor mag mx00f with 00 monitor adaptor for resolution of 000000  i just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my new mag monitor  it seems to appear either when scrolling through a window or when using alpha or word and i enter return  my guess is bad vrams as well  i really hope it isnt a design flaw  is anyone at apple listening  pushpinder singh pushmediamitedu

  according to the official documentation failure to use the iifx terminator can not only affect scsi bus performance but can also damage the bus whether this is your problem or not i dont know i have had sporadic scsi problems with my iifx since i bought it i cannot connect more than three devices fourth one causes major problems  first thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system if you continue to get errors it is probably the drive if it formats fine then i would try to format it on your system with no externals if this  fails then the scsi controller on your iifx needs repairreplacement  hope this helps     david c salmon salmonunomahaedu  
  ive been looking into getting a portable mac to do some work and ive had my eye on the pb 000 lately ive been seeing people with the old portables and theyre selling for 000 less that the pb 000s what i want to know is what are the differences between them all i know is that the portable is heavier but the pb000 doesnt have an internal drive heres what i need to know  does the portable support appletalknetwork connections whats the cpu inside a portable 00000 does the portable support system 0 whats the maximum memory capacity of the portable can you still get ram meaning does it use special simms what kind of internal hd does it use does the portable have a better screen  thanx in advance  mike gaines  what is your name                           captain jeanluc picard   what is your quest                            i seek the holy grail   what is the top velocity of a bird of prey      romulan or klingon                           ii dont knowaaahhhh               meg0000hertznjitedu                                 graphixaolcom

  ive just installed a 000 tape backup in my c000 lot of the issues are the same  so to answer your questions    my pli 00m syquest drive has a wire from the  drive to an id switch on the outside of the case  where do i connect  this switch  can the computer just tell with internal drives  you probably want to hardwire the scsi id with shorting jumpers  put it at a convenient number like 0  you could cut a hole in the back of the machine to route the id switch but why go through the hassle  you probably wont be needing to frequently change the id of your internal drive  i noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard i didnt look closely but i seem to recall it laying over the ram thats soldered onto the motherboard  would that cause problems  yeah when i first installed the tape drive i was a little concerned too  but its no problem the device is designed to fit just fine with the overhang  it shouldnt reach back beyond the romramvram simms though  one last question  is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover   the drives front panel is smaller than the space left in the case the drives panel is the same size as the spotsbm clones cases  should i just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place  you can specialorder parts to mount the device from your local apple dealer  the relevant parts are    0000000  blank bezel faceplate   0000000  cdrom carrier ie generic 000 device mounting bracket  note apples unfortunate choice of name for the slidein bracket to mount a 000 device  the service techs i talked to said oh sure we stock those  of course they were thinking of the cd caddies to hold a cd disk when you stick it in the drive  as far as i can tell apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already cut out for a standard 000 device  why not  they advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the 000 bay why not provide the faceplate   they do sell a cutout for their cdrom drive of course but thats of no use  im going to hack up the extra bezel i ordered to make a cutout for my tape drive which is a standard 000 device  good luck with your syquest  fred

   i write i recently got a zyxel u0000e modem  its great but im still having some problems figuring out what strings to use in what applications i basically need strings for zterm firstclass client and telefinder client  ive been able to get firstclass and zterm working by using  another modems settings in firstclass and copying them for zterm however it still has problems  zterm for example will list error the first time i try dialing after starting the problem  if i cancel and try again it works fine  telefinder is even worse  i cant get it to even wake up the modem  so if anyone uses a zyxel for any of these programs id greatly appreciate you sending me the setup strings you use thanks in advance   yoshiocsuclaedu writes for zterm i initially did the following atz0 atd0 atw0 then i set my init string to atz0 thats it   rsmithpearltuftsedu rod smith writes i cant help you with firstclass or telefinder but ive been using zterm and a zyxel for close to two weeks now  heres what i did  once in zterm set hardware handshaking on and the bps rate to 00000 youve probably already done this  then i typed  atd0 atw  the first line sets the modem to ignore the dtr line necessary for hardware handshaking with most though not all mac hardware handshaking cables the second stores this setting in nonvolatile memory in the modem so its the default when the modem starts  in the modem preferences dialog i have the modem initialization string set to atz0m which just insures that the stored setting is used useful if starting zterm after using something like the fax software or macwoof which change the settings in other ways  alternatively you could leave the factory default the way it is and just set the zterm initialization string to atd0m which would accomplish the same thing if the modem is always on before you start zterm and if other programs dont modify the settings  or atz0d0m would work even if other programs modify the modems settings  i do it the way i do because i sometimes forget to turn on the modem before launching zterm and this way im assured of having the correct dtr handling when the modems powered up   after comparing the above strings with my at commands reference guide i came up with atz0l0n0x0d0s0000m this is entered in the initialize box on the modem preferences in zterm quick summary of each commmand z0 reset modem to user profile 0 l0 speaker volume at 0 fairly quiet n0 ring volume at 0 fairly quiet x0 display connect info according to setting 0 see manual d0 assume dtr computer is always on s0000 dial speed at 00 as fast as zyxel can handle  in firstclass i used this same string with the addition of s00 right before the s00 command in the setup box  this disables the autoanswer  function of the modem for firstclass  i based my modem setting on the supra 000fax and just changed the above mentioned string  in telefinder i based my setting on the zoom v00  hh setting  i changed the modem initialization string to the same one i used for firstclass and everything seems to work fine  sorry it took so long to get this summary out  if someone wants to forward this to the infomacreports directory at sumexaim it might save other newbie zyxel users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings and also save the net some redundant messages  if anyone else has something to add feel free  marcus mlobbiaucsdedu     marcus lobbia               mlobbiasdcc00ucsdedu

   hi there  does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c000 regarding fpu  in all mac price lists ive seen every c000 has the message fpu optional  i know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all c000 have the fpu built in except the 000 configuration  why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list im planning to buy the c000 0000cd pretty soon but im now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not why say optional if its built in please anybody help me understand this game  regards  thian   
  anyone out there have a sony 0000s  i have one and its very nice however  if i run it in 00 mode the picture wont go very big i end up with about 0 gap either side and 0 top  bottom i suspect an internal adjustment would fix this anyone tried it  another problem is subbrightness areas that are meant to be black or off the main raster are not very black the real raster is quite visible when the screen is blanked this is not too severe but it is just not as good as other trini screens i have used if i turn the brightnesscontrast down so that the raster is not visible the real image virtually disappears  the raster size is just right if i use 0000000 but 000dpi is a bit too much  oh and i am using a rasterops 00xli card   thanks  marcus bointon marcusmeridiandemoncouk     marcus bointon                   tel 000 000 0000     marcusmeridiandemoncouk      fax 000 000 0000 i used windows for a week once but i feel better now   
  hi all thanks to you all who have responded to my request for info on various kinds of fax modem id like to ask a few more questions 0  what are the advantages of buying a global village teleport gold over other cheaper brands like supra zoom etc 0  i heard that both supra and zoom use the same software why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems of supra  what kind of incompatibility is it 0  if i decided to buy the teleport gold is there any possibility to add a voice option in the near future 0  has anyone heard of a possible voice option that supra will offer this coming summer 0  a person did mention a new att modem  is it getting good reviews from various mac magazines 0  if i want the best fastest most economically sound and possible voice option what fax modem should i buy  sorry for posting so many questions but i think theyre necessary i promise to repost any answers if theyre not already posted by a responder  thanks so much in advance  regards  thian   since i repost this message again for the second time i hope to hear from some folks on this topic  please reply  regards  thian

  a professor of mine once said the difference between a computer engineer and a computer scientist is about 0000 meaning the engineer makes 0000 more than the cs seriously though the main difference is that most cs people write programs that people will use ie database graphics word processors etc while an engineer writes for machines or control systems ie the computer in your car a flight control system computer controled devices etc in other words cs writes software while cse writes firmware  these are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is  ps the 0000 is not just a joke scott  for the most part this is a bunch of bunk  ive got a computer engineering degree yet ive spent the last 0 years writing software that people actually use  moreover the salary distinctions are incorrect i received 0 job offers upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were 0000year lower  my advice is to decide which classes and projects most interest you and pick the major that allows you to take them  emt

  i just hooked up my mac iisi to a relatively old 0 year asante ensc adapter the 00baset connection works like a charm i installed the newest drivers from asantes ftp server  the problem begins when i attach one more device to the scsi chain  specifically a 00mb drive i power up the drive then the mac the mac tests memory etc just before the happy mac face normally shows up the power light on the ensc goes out and the boot process stops so i can use the network or the external drive but not both at once this makes the asante box pretty much unusable  it doesnt look like a purely electrical scsi problem because if i turn on the drive just a second or so too late so that it doesnt get noticed during the initial scsi polling the mac boots normally and the adapter works even though the hard disk is powered on and connected the mac has never once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now and ive had it for over a year  here is what i tried changing the scsi ids of the ensc and the disk  several permutations changing the order of devices ie the ensc at the head or tail of the chain overterminating with an external terminator both devices have internal ones underterminating ie removing internal resistors from the hard disk trying another ensc box trying another identical drive trying several different scsi cables  has anybody seen this more importantly does anyone have a solution thanks a lot    e    eric behr illinois state university mathematics department behrmathilstuedu   or   behrilstubitnet  please avoid

   hi there  does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c000 regarding fpu  in all mac price lists ive seen every c000 has the message fpu optional  i know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all c000 have the fpu built in except the 000 configuration  why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list im planning to buy the c000 0000cd pretty soon but im now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not why say optional if its built in please anybody help me understand this game  regards  thian  if you get the centris 000 with cd configuration you are getting a mac with a 00rc000 processor that has builtin math coprocessor support  my  understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing the centris 000 000 without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu  apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonfpu system to become an fpu system  and it is unclear whether the 000 processor on the nonfpu system a 00lc000 can be replaced with a 00rc000 supplied by another vendor apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris 000 which only comes with a nonfpu 00lc000 processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu  the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another again according to apples memo  hope that helps  kevin lohman university book store university of washington buyer for the uw apple computers for education program

  dear netters  my sister has an apple 00 color display hooked up to an lc  problem  there is an annoying horizontal ghostlike stripe that  precesses vertically about once per second  it is about 0 cm high she is in grave danger of going insane because of it  any ideas of what it might be and how i might cure it for her  joe betts bettsnetcomcom  ps if i pick up the display i thought it might be rfi from the lc it  seems to get worse   this can be caused by two one of two things  the first and easiest to fix is interference from something around the monitor such as another monitor or other electrical device  try moving the system to another location to fix that problem  second because of the scan rate of the monitor it tends to synchronize with room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing  try turning off all lights in the rooms around the system and see if that helps  if not try moving the system somewhere else  a third solution would be to get a 00 apple color display  it should not have the same problem the 00 color is more suceptible to  you can try calling apples new support number in the us at 0000sosapple this number is for anyone who has questions regarding macintosh setup and compatibility and just went into effect for this extended support on monday april 0 0000  good luck    kevin lohman buyer university book store university of washington seattle apple computers for education program

  its my understanding that when you format a magnetooptical disc 0 the formatting software installs a driver on the disc 0 if you insert the disc in a different drive then this driver is loaded into the computers memory and then controls the drive and 0 if this driver is incompatible with the drive then the disc can not be mounted andor properly readwritten is that correct  thanks jim frazier 000000000compuservecom

  rcs0pocwruedu robert c sprecher writes  can someone please help me understand the current situation regarding simms      sure i can give is a shot  i have a iisi which i will probably keep for another 0 years i would like to add more memory ie go from 0 mb to 00 mb i know that i will need 0 x 0mb 00ns or faster simms which simms 00 pin or 00 pin      you need to get the 00pin simms  would the simms i get today be usable in 0 years with a  newer more powerful system      if you mean in a newer more powerful mac system then the answer is no apple has stated that all new macs will use the 00pin simms and no longer use the 00pin simms  hades  
  ubscarsonuwashingtonedu university bookstore writes bunt0000studenttcumnedu monthian buntan0 writes   does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c000 regarding fpu  in all mac price lists ive seen every c000 has the message fpu optional  i know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all c000 have the fpu built in except the 000 configuration  why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list      i think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesnt have an fpu it does seem to be an option even though it really isnt  im planning to buy the c000 0000cd pretty soon but im now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not      well then allow me to end your confusion the c000 only come with an lc000 in the base 000 configuration if you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an fpu  why say optional if its built in      good question i have been wondering that since feb 00th  if you get the centris 000 with cd configuration you are getting a mac with a 00rc000 processor that has builtin math coprocessor support  my  understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing the centris 000 000 without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu       this is possible but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it what apple has done is given the buyer a choice between configurations and not an option  apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonfpu system to become an fpu system  and it is unclear whether the 000 processor on the nonfpu system a 00lc000 can be replaced with a 00rc000 supplied by another vendor      this is not unclear at all in fact apple has included in the roms of those machines with lc000s code to recognize the presence of the full 000s fpu and use it thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips you pop the lc000 out and pop in a full 000  apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris 000 which only comes with a nonfpu 00lc000 processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu  the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another again according to apples memo      they did i think i would doublecheck this it has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the centris hardware designers that the lc000 and the full 000 are pin compatible and that the c000 can be upgraded to a full 000  hades   
  davidanthonyguevaracupportalcom writes  sorry if this is a faq  i dont normally read compsysmachardware i am purchasing a couple of centris 000s  i configured the systems as follows  eight 0 mb ram ethernet 0 mb vram math coprocessor option  my purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent me the apple summary documentation to prove it  i ordered the coprocessor option but im really not sure that we needed it  i thought the 000 chip had a math coprocessor built into it  has apple had a math coprocessor chip architectured to keep up with the speed of the 000 chip in the centris 000 i am concerned that i may have set up a hardware bottleneck      apple has really confused people with this whole thing i think well be answering this question for about the next year or so there is no option to get an fpu on a c000 what you have is a choice of cpus there is the 00lc000 that does not have an integrated fpu like the full 000 and is only present in the base 000 model of the c000 appleusa and there is the full 000 which you get when you order anything other than the base 000 configuration therefore since you have ordered one of the 0mb versions with onboard ethernet models you will not be getting the lc000 but even if you wanted to have the lc000 you wouldnt be able to order a c000 with 0mb ram onboard ethernet and an lc000 its not an option     also a note to people out there that have 000 c000s and c000s thinking that there is an optional fpu the 000 class chip cannot recognize an external fpu so there is no socket on the motherboard for a fpu chip and you cannot go out and purchase an fpu on a pds card or something like that the only way to get an fpu in these machines is to replace the lc000 with a full 000 and if you have a c000 you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the lc000 with the full 000 but if you have a 000 c000 you do need to have a heat sink  hades

  hi  i am working on a project for my marketing class and id like to ask your help  the assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it  technical issues are not terribly important at this point  well my groups plan is to market a full page monitor for laptop computers  it would be a thirdparty product to be installed by authorized repair centers like newer technologys palettebook screen  the idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen remember technical issues aside  in fact by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration you could have regular or full height  the screen would probably be monochrome the motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people  business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document  because of the target users and applications color screens arent really a neccessity  we could hopefully keep the cost between 0000 and 0000  now please dont write this off as completely ridiculous  i really need some constructive feedback  so if you would please reply to me via email and let me know 0 if you would consider buying a full page laptop screen 0 how much you would be willing to pay for it 0 any helpful commentaries on the idea  also if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it doubtful but who knows please send me some  thanks in advance  mike

  dpbsdchemw0ucsdedu writes hi  i think i have a problem with the stereo sound output on my quadra 000 but i am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem on his powerbook 000  any info or experience anyopne has would be greatly appreciated  when i hook my quadra up to my home stereo system the following types of sounds mono as far as i can tell all play fine through both speakers  system beeps  already provided ones such as indigo and ones i record  armor alley spectre spaceward ho   but the following games only play out of the left channel  lemmings out of this world  awesome game btw glider 00 oids   but still stereo system beeps do play in stereo through both speakers the one im specifically referrring to is apocolyptic beginning which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site sumex   all of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 000 he cant run ootw because he doesnt have color  were both running system 00    does anyone with lemmings or the other three games i mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a mac ii class quadra lc powerbook 000 or greater centris se00 etc stereo machine  i used to have a mac ii and i sort of rememeber lemmings playing in stereo on that machine not just on the left channel  i could be mistaken though  if there were a problem with the quad 000s and pb 000s i am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo  if there isnt a problem with our machines i wonder why the 0 games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers  like spectre etc do  quadra 000s and powerbook 000s have the same roms to my knowledge so maybe this is a rom problem  if so though why wouldnt system 00 patch over this problem     thanks for any help you can provide  d00jwahemulnadakthse writes mac sound hardware is diverse some macs play in stereo and mix the output the se00 for instance while others play in stereo but only has the left channel for the speaker while some are truly mono like the lc  developers know that stuff played in the left channel is guaranteed to be heard while the right channel isnt some send data to both some only send data to the left channel the first is preferrable of course  okay i guess its time for a quick explanation of mac sound  the original documentation for the sound hardware im0 documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware  basically you jam values into all the even bytes from soundbase to soundbase0x000 this was because of how the mac 000 and some later machines generated sound was by scanning this block and daing every even byte the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines  when the mac ii and apple sound chip was invented it was designed to generate stereo sound it was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented so storing bytes at the even values at soundbase meant i want to play a mono sound and so it was emulated but apple had since retracted the documentation on soundbase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation so apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound  enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games furthermore people who port from the ibm dont want to learn more apis so it has become popular for game writers to write to soundbase to make sound since it is very easy  since the mac ii apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware and the only things they have in common are that writing to soundbase works on some hardware mac ii iix iicx iici at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound through both speakers on some macs quadra 000000000 at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound on the left channel only both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons  if developers use the sound manager and i think the sound driver mono sounds will typically come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware it is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only but no one does if developers write to sound base their games will only come out the left on some games  the other problem the original mac ii only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker while the se00 mixes both isnt really related it is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines it only affects true stereo sounds sounds which are actually mono will play on the internal speaker no matter what machine you have  now to more directly address the question the games you list lemmings out of this world  awesome game btw glider 00 oids and also hellcats super tetris oxyd and many more these are just what ive tested  cheat and write to soundbase and so are only left channel on quadras   other games you list armor alley spectre spaceward ho and also pga tour golf civilization and more these are again only from personal experience  use the sound manager and work fine on all machines  the more of the story is to developers dont cheat really i am absolutely positively not allowed to do what i am about to do but im going say it anyway stop cheating on sound really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware the grace period is about to end the sound manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will work even better soon so use it  in conclusion to doug it isnt a hardware problem at least not a bug to jon it isnt a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels if they do it the right way it is taken care of automatically if you cheat there is not way to make it work on all hardware   have fun  disclaimer number 0 i dont work on sound here at apple im just pretty well informed so dont write me with sound questions  disclaimer number 0 if it says up above that i wrote anything like the grace period is about to end then it is a bug in your news feed since i am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that you know what i mean  disclaimer number 0 i dont speak for apple just me  steve bollinger

  ive recently ordered a centris 000 and need to decide on which modem to buy  im pretty sure i want to get a faxdata modem that can run at 000k but is it worth it  ill primarily only be conversing over compuserve or some other link to the internet but im not sure if those systems can supply me with data at 000k  another question i have is in some of the modem lingo out there  i understand baud rates but what does v00 and v00bis mean  i could really use some suggestions as to what a good modem for around 000 would be and why it would be a good choice  thanks for your time  dave bell dbellcoralbucknelledu  those who forget the past are condemned to relive it duncan macleod  
   is it possible ie via creative cable splicing or whatever to hook a syquest 00mb removable drive to a mac  is there any difference with the guts of the drive or is it just cable differences  thanks  rob   rob sprecher rcs0pocwruedu  many companies package syquest drives for the mac already so unless you are using one for the ibm world id buy a mac ready config  j  
  im currently having trouble connecting my pb to a true blue ibm model 0000 vga monitor  the display is bearly readable but all the details are seperated into yellow and red colors ie a window will have two images one in yellow and a ghost image in red  the background is also a little greenish  i read some time ago before i ever thought i would hook my mac up to a vga screen about an incompatability with some vga monitors due to the sync on green signal  does this sound like it could be the same demon  i also read that there are both hardware putting a diode on the green signal solution and a software solution to this problem  i dont the details does somebody have them the can email to me or post them  i checked all the faqs for this and didnt find anything about it  did i miss it somewhere  this sure seems that it would be a good thing to have in one  thanks for any replys  charles kuehmann northwestern university steel research group

  gosh i wish people would read the postings that they are following up to   seanmcdacdalca writes   in article wgwc0pdl000ynetcomcom wgwnetcomcom william g wright writes    anyway i was hoping someone knowledgeable  about mac internals could set me straight is it simply  impossible for a mac se to print grayscale or could    to use the grayscale features i believe you need a mac equipped with colour quickdraw i was told this somewhere or other but its    i think you will find that the mac se can print grayscale images loaded  with the proper software however the mac se cannot display grayscale on  the original poster w g wright posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizzbang laser printer from apple a select 000 i think which can print grayscale he then said that he cannot print grayscale from his se computer and also that all the experts he has dealt with agree that it is not possible  this is the one major bugbear about doing a 0rd party se upgrade compared to apples se to se00 upgrade you will never be able to run color quickdraw it is color quickdraw that controls color and grayscale  ses can print some colour this is because quickdraw  the original noncolour version has the right hooks for eight colours some of you will remember the scsigraph solution to getting a colour screen for your se i think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something  there is no reason that apple couldnt release software patches for older computers there are lots of mac pluses classics and ses that have been upgraded to 00000 and 00000 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with color quickdraw  but they wont and 0rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the macs roms ie nutek et al  just one caveat i would have thought that if you were printing a postscript grayscale image onto a postscript grayscale printer that you would be able to do so whatever mac you were using and i am pretty sure that the select 000 is not a postscript printer  correct me if im wrong  phil ryan melbourne australia

    also if someone would recommend another  accelerator for the macplus id like to hear about it    thanks for any time and effort you expend on this    karl  try looking at the brainstorm accelerator for the plus  i believe it is the best solution because of the performance and price  why spend 000 upgrading a computer that is only worth 000    the brainstorm accelerator is around 000  it speeds up the internal clock speed to 00mhz  that may not seem like much but it also speeds up scsi transfers  i think that feature is unique to brainstorm check it out  david lau lauaerospaceaeroorg

  just a quick summary of recent findings re high speed modems top three contenders seem to be att paradyne zyxel and us robotics zyxel has the biggest cult following and can be had for under 000 but i ignored it because i need something with mac software which will work without any tweaking  the att dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability they are backordered at the moment probably because of the special 000 price in effect until may its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two modems warning att ads say that the modem comes with a mac kit cables  all and has lifetime warranty this applies only when you order directly from paradyne i called elektek one of the distributors and they wanted to charge me 00 for cable and gave only 0 year warranty  usr sportster for the mac is also highly but not as highly recommended its only 000 from clubmac and if you are willing to roll your own cable and dont care about the faxstf software you can get the generic model from pc outlets for 000  all this assuming that you dont have a rich uncle and cant afford a motorola codex      i ended up ordering the dataport well see how it works in two weeks or so    eric behr illinois state university mathematics department behrmathilstuedu   or   behrilstubitnet  please avoid

  jeff   i have answers to both of your questions  first i recommend the sony cpd0000 monitor  it is a 00 trinitron vga monitor but it is designed specifically for use with the lc  it works only with macs with specific video capabilities which means only the lcs and anything after the ci  all it takes is a macvga cable i recommend one from james engineering which is about 00  these cost about 000 as compared to the much higher prices of comparable monitors because they are not multisynch  i have used one for half a year and i love it   second i have used syex and found them to be decent  i had a backorder on a supra modem which i cancelled  they were helpful in explaining the reasons why there were delays and they had supras number ready for me  the only complaint was that they did not always return my calls   i have been told that the cpd0000 is selling for 000 from jrs 0000000000  i think syex is a little more but i dont know  david   from planet bmug the firstclass bbs of bmug  the message contained in  this posting does not in any way reflect bmugs official views

  the real question here in my opinion is what motorola processors running system 0 on a mac are comparable to what intel processors running windows on a pc  i recall there being a conversation here that a 00000 running windows benchmarks at about the same speed as 00mhz 000 in system 0  i dont know if that is true but i would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this  david   from planet bmug the firstclass bbs of bmug  the message contained in  this posting does not in any way reflect bmugs official views

  the subject says what i would like to do here are the details  i have a 000ke with the macrescue upgrade board that makes it the equivalent of a plus system 0 and macenvy both identify it as such  the macrescue board clips onto the 00000 on the mb  it also has a 00000 itself  periodically i have to remove the clip not an entirely easy thing to do and clean the legs of the 00000 larry pinas book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with snap on upgrades  the 00000s legs will oxidize causing  unusual system errors  well thats me  so i would like to do something permanent and i think it would be fairly easy to put a socket in where the 00000 currently is and modify the macrescue board to plug in  what im not 000 sure of is whether it will work  it seems to me that the two 00000s arent acting independently so removing one shouldnt have any effect on the performance of my mac  im about 00 sure  will someone provide the extra 0  erik erikcheshireoxyedu

    the quadra 000 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware reads pram obtains all info from last session including the volume setting and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound and waits on the scsi controller to respond to the boot up code   if the dram produces an error or a registers cannot be read from a device or the device corrupts that addressdata or control paths then if it is possible the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the  sad mac sound   this is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac if you cannot control the volume of the quadra even at boot up then i feel there is something incorrect with the logic board   my quadra 000 does not show the problems you are having   steve h

  i remember someone mention about a 000meg syquest  has anyone else heard anything about this  id be interested in the cost per megabyte and the approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the bernoulli 000  i think you must be talking about the syquest 000 code named mesa i believe it is a 00 winchester technology drive pretty much like the other syquest drives in terms of how it works according to the latest macleak the  drive has a 000 ms access time 00 mbs sustained throughput these figures are from memory so they could be slightly off but they give you an idea of performance nonetheless the drive was originally released for the pc and just recently was released for the mac world dont ask me what the  differences are and through they are currently in limited supply according to a syquest rep they are in the process of ramping up for mass production i have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in macleak including pli massmicro clubmac and macwarehouses poweruser the pli and massmicro units are priced at just around 0000 the lesser name brands are going for around 000 for an external drive cartridges which hold  000 mb sell for about 00 each at these prices the drives and cartridges are cheaper and better performing than the 00mb drives cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and bernoulli drives but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper and more reliable  personally im excited by the new drive and look forward to  getting my hands on one chris wand     egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity                                                       frank leahy

  send follow ups to compsysmacadvocacy sorry about the header but the  pnews here does not let one easily change the headers and i gave up after a  year of trying this sheet is also available by ftp on sumexaimstanfordedu  000000 in the infomacreport as macibmcompare000txt mac  ibm infoversion 000  the reason for this general data sheet is to consolidate and condense the  information out there so that people in both camps can be clear and accurate  about what they are saying about their machines  since computer technology  is always changing there are always going to be points in which the sheet will  be lacking or incorrect on information  so please just dont say the sheet  is incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to  make the needed corrections  all prices are in us dollars to keep this data sheet organized please provide if possible article  citations for the information provided or corrected and keep the opinions to  a minimum  as this is a general data sheet keep the info provided simple so  i can understand what is being talked about and can explain it to others  finally keep the information relevant to the section corrected for example  os code in rom is software contained in hardware so no more of the but it  is supported in os disk software data for the hardware section please  thank you note  for proper reading off line

  question for those familiar with quadra vram  i put 0 000k vram simms in my quadra 000 in the 0 slots closest to the ram simm slots and i got no results whatsoever  i have been told that the builtin video should support at least 00bit and maybe 00bit color on a macintosh color display  however the monitors control panel still lists 0bit 000 colors as the highest possible  the q000 will only do 0bit or 00bit color  if you want the higher color depth its 0mbs of vram altogether for a monitor up to 00  for a 00 monitor you can get 0bit max  hope this answers your questions  james wang

   i have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection  between a mac duo 000 and a pc i have used mackermit and versaterm on  the mac side i have used procomm kermit and softerm on os0 on  the pc or ps side i have used nonhardware handshaking and hardware  ahdshaking cables and know my hands are shaking from the effort nothing  has allowed file transfers from the mac to the ps     could i hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information  out the serial port of a duo 000 fast like via a modem or via a  sysex dump    could anyone with a duo help me out i am going absolutely insane  i wanna know if the problem is my duo or all duo 000s or all duos  or just me     hmmm sounds vaguely similar to a problem i had a long time ago when i was   trying to use kermit  i was building a serial connection between my duo 000   and my next  i think the problem was in the handshaking  basically you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides  a safe   place to start is by selecting no handshaking on either end  one problem is   that the zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong and only a reset will clear it  i dont know the specifics  but this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system    it could very well be that you are doing things righteventually but one   wrong move like trying a bad handshaking protocol can screw up any further   correct actions until the next machine reset  i have wedged my mac and also   my next that way  now i can send files back and forth between the duo and the next without any   problem and at pretty high speeds too  i dont know what kind of chip the pc uses but i think the zilog 0000 is   pretty standard  hope this helps avery

   attention mac quadra owners many storage industry experts have  concluded that mac quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating  from the standard scsi specification this results in silent corruption  of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices  although i will not name the devices since it is not their fault an  example would be a sony 00 inch mo without the special maccompatible  firmware installed one solution sometimes is to disable blind writes   to the best of my knowledge there arent any problems with quadras and blind transfers  trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the tibs or didnt test their driver with the device in question well designed tibs poll or loop at every point where delays of 00µsec occur this usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can hiccup in the middle of blocks  if this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going  in anycase the scsi manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync  actual data loss would only occur if the driver didnt pay attention to the errors coming back  note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the scsi bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the scsi manager  the problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the scsi chip when the next byte hasnt been clocked yet  also note that the bus error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesnt crash the machine  clinton bauder apple computer

  hello i have a question or two about the serial ports for the powerbooks specifically the 000 with system 000 is there a difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus any other mac say plus or ii i have heard though not confirmed by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds  i also heard that sys 00s new power manager fixes this problem allowing speeds just as any other serial port  my particular use is that i have a 0000 evb board that i need to interface with my powerbook via the modem port at 0000 baud  currently we are interfacing using mac pluses  i set everything up just as in lab and nothing  in fact the powerbook locks up  can anyone help inform advise i would appreciate it   i would prefer email since i dont read the news at all i will post a summary if enough response is generated  thanks   faisal m bhamani facemanccwfccutexasedu  ps if this topic has been discussed already please excuse me and direct me to the appropriate places thanks

   can some people with cache cards please post speedometer numbers they  get with the cards i have only one report which seems to indicate  that a 00k cache card gives you only about a 0 speedup   ok  i have a record that shows a iisi with and without a 00kb cache its small enough that i will attach it  i have also measured some real programs with and without the 00 kb cache  the speedup varies a lot from app to app ranging from 0 to 00  i think an average of 0000 is about right  the subjective difference is not great but is sometimes noticable  a simple cache card certainly does not transform a iisi into something enormously better  i do not have an fpu  the conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 00k and 00k caches  i bought mine from third wave for well under 000  i have had absolutely no problems at all with it  if you get complete speedometer runs for a 00k cache id like to see them  lets check the conventional wisdom  the so called performance rating numbers by themselves are of no interest   cheers  this file must be converted with binhex 00 0kbfkpq0g000000e0aqk0abgjcfgigfhh ghqqsqbucsquuqscfphghlhhclkjqtuldhhblucucjugq0hgik hcakr0spijqrqqujnjucldussquutqcudl0j0ltuuquubut sl0uuqjsutqjsudtuuqcq0ucfjc0acsldld jb000l0aiggbjibpusb00z 0ikcqfmvxmhhairdjpcvrlucvsz0si0jljpiflzq0aal0xrhjf 0lj00az0tv0l0lneaprei0vipiqkfdkzvb0t0lkc0xz0lghfik alkhq0qhh0milcq0iqpgespejnbhmdhllqhlre00c0qbqsrmm pakjpgxqcpr0ryr0eyd0mh0h0rj0hapclhrsg0pf0eiymc0ris00efp cgevrtrafaqkapg0jksfe0mcbikfqc0kuh0rrbddtixp0z v00l0d00feu00v0k0ujad0fzaezr0egtyknxh00sjf0eig0el0vzj vfbtbhjlex0pe0kj0zkh0cc0fjkhgzcbhhnv0dc0xds00dfdpjei qcxhkeldpyyy0f0rgjm0rjtcymi0b0kbbpubqpu0qm0mihgyrb eung0msapmri0kldinqmqjza0bqmimqkc0mcf00e0u0 fy0u0exb0t0d0r0ae00padkcakea0sthlia0hfhda0ba0p 0virti0vsejgsqqqd0pm00m0idhhm0fruq0ekg0evirqj cme0jfyi0qlvi0qhhr0000hy00trzkxipqrqkcu0ed0rcr qciukzmefiyibqmeffkt0bbjhyl0k0pxve0b0uam000dahccxl iejf0s0a0p0p0zc0h0ajcy0brjdm0flj00bisc0jhqetfvk000rr zviqrbth0b0f0rhcpuy0ju00jy0prcdpaxafrlxrhfydmv0i 0dmtf0nmlp0jdxn0k0c00r0qb0c0ke0hvkiarantab0yyl0tm0 f0bufflgjd0qa0reuq00sjp0bc0lefr00kpdgj0bijhnadh0mrm 0qpjiteram00rhjajfhjr0jjxdk00ecab0dkjkrq0ricrcckrd m0vrbjcxnr0frchypkr0chjjijhkj00pqa0rbzff0vkg0qg0 mbmupg0xkuex0glglglgek0hrxf0ix0irnykbmrsbn00m0qpq0radj fhrc0pei0rfhy0jghpshhnr0jjxb0fbcljkfb000qgm0mclees mhpf00b0arqqplkq0i0qrmms0l0fp0cpjy0ddap0aleeipbd0c rl0pexj000khf0zzkgn0h0abt00lrdfa00xvbkj0metlp0 qckrpmj0e0bnfjhnvpffjpqxjnlyrlpq0ccm0l0empcxz0b mpvs0p0yxtb0f0qasrxrmrzf0ilxsvppvjicfmrrekxddi0fhmtq0vlt aalm000chgurme0yaridiy0lpe0hpaifhnfmqqlchvcduajjeb0ndih pjqedx0cgdtvmdy000pimr0jerpqqaacvkc0lzi0z0pzk0fvrd hfr0mci0nqh0rej0ve0rnabfbqqlkc0lkqrh0mkhnyaucqhq 0kajhr0efqr0h0b0zslfg00tpmif000pcd0emb0sc000s00 0c0rjjtb00admicj0a0b0ap     peter newton newtoncsutexasedu

    im currently trying to select which magnetooptical drive to purchase  im primarily looking at 000mb drives although i might consider 000mb ones  when looking through macworld and macuser ads the prices for the 000mb drives seem to range from just under 0000 for the dgr 000rem portable magic 000mb portable fujitsu or nudesign 000mb from macdirect to about 0000 for the fwb hammerdisk 000 and mass microsystems datapak mo000  different drives use different mechanisms  most fujitsu sony epson probably some others  my problem is that after reading the nov 00 macworld and apr 00 macuser reviews of these drives im still not sure what to get  so im asking if anyone has had goodbad experiences with any 000mb mo drive or can shed some light on the wide range of prices is spending more really buying me much reliability of different drives compatibility between them or  anything else i should probably know  thanks  john sasinowski

  the real question here in my opinion is what motorola processors running system 0 on a mac are comparable to what intel processors running windows on a pc  i recall there being a conversation here that a 00000 running windows benchmarks at about the same speed as 00mhz 000 in system 0  i dont know if that is true but i would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this  david  that seems about right  i have a mac iisi 0000 with 00k cache card running system 00  my roommate has a 000sx00 0000 running windows 00 and from what ive seen my iisi is faster in some operations  in others they are comparablebut keep in mind im strictly speaking of operations on the desktop level of windows 00 and system 00 not actual computational speed in other programs

  i guess the real question is  who asked the original questions and why was it so broad are we talking pure processing power what kind of processing btw isolated from every other factor and influence in the system   or are we shopping for a home computer based on the cpu specs yuck  i just finished a project that involves realtime processing of serial data and discovered that the programming interface assembly has a lot to do with the power of a cpu in a particular application if what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given then not only is it easy but its cheap and quick  if you have to fake things like resolving indirection without a lea instruction then your cycle count goes through the roof  well lets not start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose the orginal question was about classifying microprocessors having reread the entire thread i dont think much more can be said without getting down into specific proposed systems with important details given   thats it for another 000  cheers everyone      peter pundy    email 0000000jefflabqueensuca    ive got no witty wisdom to share but have a nice day anyway

  i have a mac plus with 00mb ram i have just bought an extra 0mb so that i can have the max 0mb ram that a plus supports however i cant get it to boot after i install the 0 extra simms instead i get a sad mac sorry but i cant remember the code looking at the motherboard i can see that 0 resistors have been snipped off where it says 000kb path  0 row i assume that was done when the first 0mb simms were added  so my question is are there any other resistors that need snipping  or do i have bum simms which need to be exchanged  any and all advice will be appreciated  chris gatenby gatenbmrisunmedyaleedu  
      basically the mac pluses are constantly rebooting themselves as if the   reboot button were being pushed  sometimes the mac is able to fully boot   well this threads been going long enough ill add a diferent twist  i found that the constant rebooting was due to overheating we  had added 0mb ram and were operating in a non ac environment adding an external cooling fan fixed it right up  over a year ago          george jefferson    georgemechseasupennedu  
   i have a logitech 000grays hand scanner from a pc  im wondering if anyone has been successful in connecting the scanner to a mac  it has the same connector and is a serial device on the pc  i can imagine the pins coniguration would need to changeed but im not sure if the signal levels would be correct and if the mac sw would work with it    of course the manuals say nothing about the interface connector layout or anything hwish  any ideas   thanx  steve

faq  the second part is    posted to compsysmacsystem and features many questions about   system  software  the third part is posted every two weeks in   compsysmacmisc  tables of contents for those two pieces are   included above please familiarize  yourself with all three   sections of this document  before posting              all pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from   rtfmmitedu 00000000 in the directory    pubusenetnewsanswersmacintosh  except for this introductory   faq which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as   generalfaqz the name of each file has the format of the last   part of the group name followed by faqz eg the faq for   compsysmacsystem is stored as systemfaqz and the faq for   compsysmacmisc is stored as miscfaqz  rtfm stores files as    compressed z binary files  if you leave off the z at the end   of  the file name when getting the file rtfm will automatically    decompress the file before sending it to you  you can also have    these files mailed to you by sending an email message to    mailserverrtfmmitedu with the line  send   pubusenetnewsanswersmacintoshname  in the body text where   name is the name of the file you want as  specified above eg   generalfaq  you can also send this server a message with the   subject help for more detailed instructions               i have a question  00             congratulations  youve come to the right place  usenet is    a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions   how do i lock a floppy disk to queries that would make steve   jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror  i used   resedit to remove resources init 00 wdef 00 and nvir 00 from my   system file and used the hex editor to add code string a00b00 as a   patch to the sfgetfile routine so the standard file dialog box   would be a nice shade of mauve  everything worked fine until i   installed supercdevblaster and now when i use the aldus driver to   print from pagemaker 00d0 to a linotronic 0000 my system hangs    ps  im running system 000 on a powerbook 000            since the macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume we   ask that you first peruse this faq list including at least the   table of contents for the other pieces of it check any other   relevant online resources listed below in question 00 especially   the faq lists for the other macintosh newsgroups and rtfm read   the friendly manual before posting your question  we realize that   you are personally incensed that the system is taking up fourteen   of your newlyinstalled twenty megs of ram but this question has   already made its way around the world three hundred times before   and its developing tired feet  finally before posting to any   newsgroup macintosh or otherwise please familiarize yourself   with the basic etiquette of usenet as described in the newsgroup   newsannouncenewusers    how do i use this document  where can i get it  00                 compsysmacfaq is currently divided into multiple pieces   a general introduction which youre reading now and specific lists   for the newsgroups compsysmacsystem and compsysmacmisc  faq   lists for compsysmacwanted compsysmacapps and   compsysmachardware are in development  when ready each part   will be available in its respective newsgroup  all pieces are   available via anonymous ftp from rtfmmitedu in the   pubusenetnewsanswersmacintosh directory except for this   document itself which is named generalfaqz the pieces are named   as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by   faq eg systemfaqz miscfaqz  the z means the  file is   stored compressed so youll need to ftp it in binary mode and use   either maccompress stuffit deluxe or the unix uncompress command    to decompress it  however if you leave off the z extension when    you get the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file   before sending it to you              this introductory document is posted to all of the concerned   newsgroups  the tables of contents for each of the specific faq   lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to   get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere   else in the faq even if you dont have the other parts at hand    its not always obvious especially to newcomers where a   particular question or comment should be posted  please   familiarize yourself with the faq lists in all the major macintosh   newsgroups before posting in any of them  which questions appear   in which faqs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong   where              to jump to a particular question search for   sectionnumberquestionnumber enclosed in parentheses  for   example to find where can i ftp macintosh software search for   the string  00  to jump to a section instead of a question   use a zero for  the question number    what other information is available  00        compsysmacfaq provides short answers to a number of    frequently asked questions appropriate for the usenet newsgroup   compsysmacmisc and compsysmacsystem  four other files are   worthy of particular note daryl spitzer maintains a faq list   covering macintosh programming for the newsgroup   compsysmacprogrammer  its posted to that group weekly and    available for anonymous ftp from ftpcsuoregon 00000000 in    pubmac  eric rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list    for compsysmaccomm available in that newsgroup and from   rascalicsutexasedu in macfaq where the file youre reading now   is also irregularly archived  this list answers many frequently   asked questions about networking unix and the mac   telecommunications and foreign file formats  norm walsh has   compiled an excellent faq for compfonts that answers a lot of   questions about the various kinds of fonts and crossplatform   conversion and printing  its available in compfonts or by ftp   from ibiscsumassedu in pubnormcompfontsfaq  finally jim   jagielski maintains a faq for compunixaux covering apples unix   environment aux  its posted every 0 to 0 weeks in compunixaux   and newsanswers its available for anonymous ftp at   jaguboxgsfcnasagov    which newsgroup should i post to  00          there are no stupid questions but there are misplaced ones    you wouldnt ask your english teacher how to do the definite   integral  of ln x between zero and one would you  so dont ask   the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when microsoft   word is in the background  ignorance of basic netiquette is not an   excuse if you want people to help you you need to learn their   ways of  communicating            posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your   mailbox with pearls of wisdom and maybe a few rotten oysters too      posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering   silence  for instance the most common and glaring mispost one   that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the macintosh regions of   usenet as would a purple elephant to aleuts in the arctic asking a   question about networking anywhere except compsysmaccomm   normally produces no useful responses  posting the same question   to compsysmaccomm ensures that your post is read and considered   by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few   network software designers             please post to exactly one newsgroup  do not crosspost    if a question isnt important enough for you to take the extra   minute to figure out where it properly belongs its not important   enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading    for the same reason compsysmacmisc should not be used as a   catchall newsgroup             the breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in   this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs   where  specifically questions about productivity applications   software you bought your macintosh to run not software you bought   to make your macintosh run better should go to compsysmacapps   unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup    communications programs games hypercard compilers and databases   all have more topical compsysmac newsgroups  post questions   about noncommunications hardware including questions about what   software is necessary to make particular hardware work to   compsysmachardware  questions about macos system software   belong in compsysmacsystem  questions about utilities and   extensions normally belong in compsysmacmisc  questions about   aux go to compunixaux  detailed questions about appletalk   belong in compprotocolsappletalk             direct questions about hypercard to compsysmachypercard    nonhypercard programming questions and questions about development   environments should go to compsysmacprogrammer  resedit   questions may be posted either to compsysmacmisc   compsysmacsystem or compsysmacprogrammer but generally the   netters who inhabit the darker recesses of compsysmacprogrammer   are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking              a general exception to the above rules is that any very   technical question about an application that actually begins to   delve into the hows of a program as well as the whats recent   example how does writenow which is written entirely in assembly   compare to other word processors written in high level languages   might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup               for sale and want to buy posts should go to   compsysmacwanted and miscforsalecomputersmac only  we   understand that youre desperate to sell your upgraded 000k mac to   get the  for a powerbook 000 but trust me anyone who wants to   buy it will be reading compsysmacwanted  political and   religious questions the mac is better than windows is not is   too is not is too hey how bout the amiga what about it is   not is too belong in compsysmacadvocacy  anything not   specifically mentioned above probably belongs in compsysmacmisc             finally dont be so provincial as to consider only the   compsysmac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions    many questions about modems in compsysmaccomm are much more   thoroughly discussed in compdcommodems  questions about mac midi   are often better handled in compmusic even though its not a   macintosh specific newsgroup  shop around  usenets a big place   and not everything relevant to the macintosh happens in   compsysmac    0 someone just asked why the system was taking up sixteen of  their  twenty megabytes of ram  shouldnt i put my brilliance and  wit on  display for the world by posting the seventeenth response        no  frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as   frequent questions  unless you really have something new to add to   the traditional answers such as the recent discovery that fonts in   system 00 could eat memory private email is a much better medium   for answering common questions like this one              you might want to add a mention of this faq in your email   response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it   before posting future questions  i do read all the newsgroups   covered here and have written a small script in microphone ii that   lets me send pwfaqs people with frequently asked questions the   section of this document that answers their question with just the   click of a button so please dont feel obligated to respond to   someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they   cant be troubled to read the faq list to get it            ftp  00      where can i ftp mac software  00        the three major north american internet archives of shareware   freeware and demo software are sumexaimstanfordedu 000000   macarchiveumichedu 00000000000 and wuarchivewustledu   0000000000 which mirrors the other two sites and several   others wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove   them for space concerns and still has files that were deleted from   the formerly important site rascalicsutexasedu  rascal was   notable for storing its files in macbinary format rather than the   less efficient binhex format common at the other archives  unless   otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document   should be available at the above sites           to keep traffic on the internet manageable scandinavians    should try connecting to ftpfunetfi 0000000000 ftplthse   000000000 or sicsse 0000000000 instead  those in    the uk should look first at srcdocicacuk 00000000    continental europeans can try nicswitchch 00000000     ezinfoethzch 000000000 and anlanlfr000000000    australian users should try to find what they want at archieau   00000000 which mirrors infomac and macarchive  japanese   users will find sumex mirrored at ftputokyoacjp   00000000000            a fourth very important site is ftpapplecom 0000000    this is apples semiofficial repository for system software   developer tools source code technical notes and other things   that come more or less straight from apples mouth  some material   at this site may not be distributed outside the us or by other   sites that dont have an official license to distribute apple   system software  please read the various readme documents   available at ftpapplecom for the detailed info if youre   connecting from outside the us or if you wish to redistribute   material you find here    can i get shareware by email  00        the infomac archives at sumexaim are available by email from   listservricevm0bitnet alternately listservricevm0riceedu    the listserver responds to the commands macarch help macarch   index and macarch get filename  mac archive files are available   from macmacarchiveumichedu  send it a message containing the   words help and index no quotes on the first two lines of your   message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files   you may request  you can retrieve files from other sites by using   the server at ftpmaildecwrldeccom  for details send it a   message with just the text help no quotes    where can i find application x  00        if you cant find what youre looking for at one of the above   sites try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it   an email message addressed to archie with the subject help    archie servers are located at archierutgersedu 00000000   america archiemcgillca 00000000 the original archie server   in canada archieau 00000000 australia archiefunetfi   0000000000 scandinavia and archiedocicacuk 00000000   the uk and the continent  these sites index the tens of   thousands of files available for anonymous ftp  login as archie   no password is needed and type prog filename to find what   youre looking for or type help for more detailed instructions    for instance you would type prog disinfectant to search for a   convenient ftp site for disinfectant  if the initial search fails   to turn up the file you want try variations on and substrings of   the name  for instance if you didnt find disinfectant with prog   disinfectant you might try prog disi instead  substring   searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross  to avoid many   erroneous matches add a hqx to the end of the substring eg   prog disihqx  most mac software available on the net ends in   hqx but almost no unix or pc software does            please check the above archives and archie personally before   asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware  if you   follow the above advice you should almost never have to ask the   net where to find a particular piece of software    can someone mail me application x  00        no  nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from   compbinariesmac that was corrupt or missed at your site  please   refer to the first questions in this section to find out about   anonymous ftp archie and automatic email servers    what is bin hqx cpt etc  00        most files available by ftp are modified twice to allow them to   more easily pass through foreign computer systems  first theyre   compressed to make them faster to download and then theyre   translated to either a binhex hqx or macbinary bin format   that other computers can digest  the macintosh uses a special   twofork filing system that chokes most other computers  binhex   files are 0bit ascii text files while macbinary files are pure   0bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary   protocol             how a file has been translated and compressed for   transmission is indicated by its suffix  normally a file will have   a name something like filenamexxxyyy  xxx indicates how it was   compressed and yyy indicates how it was translated  to use a file   youve ftpd and downloaded to your mac youll need to reverse the   process  most files you get from the net require a twostep   decoding process  first change the binhex hqx or macbinary   bin file to a doubleclickable macintosh file then decompress   it  which programs decode which file types is covered in the table   below  also note that most macintosh telecommunications programs   will  automatically convert macbinary files to regular macintosh   files as they are downloaded   suffix      sit  cpt  hqx  bin  pit  z  image  dd  zip uu  tar

              x        a few notes on the decompressors        stuffit is a family of products that use several different   compression schemes  the freeware stuffit expander will unstuff   all of them  versions of stuffit earlier than 00 stuffit 000   stuffit classic unstuffit and stuffit deluxe 00 and 00 will   not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by stuffit 00    you need to get a more recent version of stuffit or stuffit   expander                stuffit 000 lite and deluxe consistently makes smaller   archives than any other macintosh compression utility  to allow   maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep   netbandwidth down please compress all files you send to anonymous   ftp sites with stuffit 000              uutool maccompress and suntar handle the popular unix   formats of  uuencode uu compress z and tar tar   respectively  the unix versions are often more robust than the mac   products so use them instead when thats an  option  translators   that allow stuffit lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also   available by anonymous ftp              macutil is dik winters package of unix utilities to   decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading   them to a mac since unix stores files differently than does the   mac macutil creates macbinary bin files which should be   automatically converted on download  it cant decompress   everything in particular it cant decompress the new stuffit 00   archives   however if you need only one or two files out of an   archivefor instance if you want to read the readme to find out if   a program does what you need it to do before you download all of   itmacutil is indispensable  it can be found at sumexaim in the   infomacunix directory       a few notes on the compression formats        bin  these are macbinary files  always use a binary file   transfer protocol when transferring them never ascii or text    most files on the net are stored as hqx instead  only rascal   stores most of its files in bin format  most communications   programs such as zterm and mackermit are capable of translating   macbinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance   theyll be downloading macbinary files          image this format is normally used only for system software   so that online users can download files that can easily be   converted into exact copies of the installer floppies  instead of   using diskcopy to restore the images to floppies you can use steve   christensens freeware utility  mountimage to treat the images on   your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive    mountimage has a reputation for being buggy so you should have   some blank floppies and a copy of diskcopy handy just in case          sea x x  sea files dont merit a position in the above   table because theyre selfextracting  they may have been created   with compact pro stuffit or even diskdoubler but all should be   capable of decompressing themselves when doubleclicked  for some   unknown reason alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard   designation for selfextracting archives created with their    payware products superdisk and more disk space  instead they    append either x or x to selfextracting archives    how can i get binhex  stuffit  etc  00        by far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human   being to copy them onto a floppy for you  if youre at a   university theres absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to   give you a copy and if youre anywhere less remote than mcmurdo   sound chances are very good that someone at a computer center   dealership or user group can provide you with a copy of stuffit    once you have stuffit any version you dont need binhex               if youre such a computer geek that the thought of actually   asking a living breathing human being instead of a computer    terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of    protoplasmic jelly you can probably download a working copy  of   stuffit from a local bulletin board system              if you have religious objections to software gotten by any    means other than anonymous ftp then i suppose ill mention that    you can in fact ftp a working copy of stuffit though this is by    far the hardest way to get it  ftp to wuarchivewustledu and    login  type the word binary  hit return  type cd   mirrorsrascalicsutexaseducompression and hit return  then   get stuffitexpander000seabin  and hit return  of course   its always possible that by the time you read this stuffit   expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this   fails look for something similar  if youve ftpd straight onto   your mac you should now have a selfextracting archive which will   produce a working copy of stuffit expander when doubleclicked  if   youve ftpd to your mainframe or unix account first you still   need to use a modem program to download it to your mac  just make   sure that the mac is receiving in macbinary mode and the mainframe   is sending in binary mode  if you need more details on the last   step consult the faq list for compsysmaccomm and the manuals   for both your mainframe and macintosh telecommunications software         how can i get binhex stuffit etc from a pc  00         you cant  there is absolutely no way to get an executable   macintosh file from an ftp site onto a pc and then onto your mac   without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp   you must beg borrow or steal the necessary software such as   binhex or stuffit lite from another person  i realize this may    terrify those among you who havent left your parents basement    since you got an  apple ii in 0000 but eventually youre going    to need to link up with some human being other than your mother     though i suppose if youre this much of  a nerd you could send    your mother out to get it for you  while youre gathering   your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world    of daylight please dont bother the net by asking this question   again  there simply is no way to move executable macintosh   programs from a pc or other nonmacintosh computer onto a    mac without software that is not bundled with most macs     troubleshooting what to do before posting when things go wrong 00             while the various faq lists cover a lot of specific   problems there are far more problems that arent covered here    these are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking   for help  you should probably also perform the tenstep   preventative maintenance routine described in section four   especially rebuilding the desktop 00 and resizing the system   heap 00  following these steps may  or may not solve your   problem but it will at least make it easier  for others to   recommend solutions to you   identify the problem  00        microsoft word is crashing doesnt say much  what were you   doing when it crashed  can you repeat the actions that lead to the   crash  the more information you provide about the actions   preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you    the more precisely youve identified the problem and the actions   preceding it step 0 the easier it will be to tell if the   following steps fix the problem  for example sometimes   quarkxpress 00 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error is   not nearly as helpful as quarkxpress 00 crashes when i link two   text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already   contain text  the former will leave you wondering whether the bug   remains after a given step  the latter lets you go right to the   problem and see if its still there or not    read the read me file  00        many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and   bugs in their read me files  often these arent documented in the   manual read any read me files to see if any of the problems sound   familiar    check for viruses  00        run disinfectant or another antiviral across your disk  virus   infections are rarer than most people think but they do occur and   they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do    reinstall the application and all its support files  00              for half a dozen reasons external magnetic fields   improperly written software the alignment of the planets a file   on a disk may not contain the data its supposed to contain  this   can cause all types of unexplained unusual behavior  restoring   from original masters will normally fix this    reinstall the system software  00          bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file   than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous    see question 00 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean   reinstall              if the problem continues to occur after youve taken these   steps chances are youve found either a conflict between your   application and some other software or a genuine bug in the   program  so its time to    isolate the problem  00              you need to find the minimal system on which the problem   will assert itself  here are the basic steps of isolating the   cause of a system or application crash         arun only one application at a time occasionally applications do      conflict with each other  if the problem does not manifest itself      without other applications running simultaneously you can begin      launching other applications until you find the one that causes       the crash            bif youre running system 0 turn off multifinder  if youre      running system 0 allot as much memory to the application as you       can afford  sometimes programs just need more memory especially       when performing complicated operations            c if youre running system 0 turn off virtual memory and 00bit      addressing  theres still an awful lot of system 0 hostile      software out there including some from companies that really       have no excuse  can you say microsoft word 00 boys and girls        i knew you could  some of this software only expresses its       incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken            dboot from a virgin system floppy  if the problem disappears      you likely have an init conflict  you need to progressively remove      extensions until the problem vanishes  use a little common sense      when choosing the first extensions to remove  if the problem occurs      when you try to open a file remove any inits that mess with the      standard file open procedure such as super boomerang first  if the      problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated      either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or if you have      a lot of them perform a binary search by removing half of the      extensions at a time  once the problem disappears add half of the      most recently removed set back  continue until youve narrowed the      conflict down to one extension  when you think youve found the      offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make       sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem    contact technical support  00        by now you should have a very good idea of when where and why   the conflict occurs  if a tech support number is available for the   software call it  if youre lucky the company will have a work   around or fix available  if not perhaps theyll at least add the   bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release            preventive maintenance  00          you wouldnt drive your car 000000 miles without giving it a   tuneup  a computer is no different  regular tuneups avoid a lot   of problems  although there are mac mechanics wholl be happy to   charge you 00 or more for the equivalent of an oil change theres   no reason you cant change it yourself  the following ninestep   program should be performed about every three months     trash unneeded files  00        many of the operations that follow will run faster and more   smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a   little time cleaning up your hard disk  if youre at all like me   youll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for   applications you no longer have archives of software youve   dearchived shareware you tried out and didnt like announcements   for events that have come and gone and many other files you no   longer need  if youre running system 0 you may also have several   more megabytes in your trash can alone  throw them away and empty    the trash    rethink your extensions  00        some macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain    seriously consider whether you actually need every extension    in your collection  if you dont use the functionality of an   extension at least every fifth time you boot up youre probably   better off not storing it in your system folder where it only takes   up memory destabilizes your system and slows down every startup    for instance if you only read pc disks once a month theres no   need to keep accesspc loaded all the time  cutting back on your   extension habit can really help avoid crashes     rebuild the desktop  00        the desktop filedatabase holds all the information necessary   to associate each file with the application that created it  it   lets the system know what application should be launched when you   open a given file and what icons it should display where    depending on its size each application has one or more   representatives in the desktop file  as applications and files   move on and off your hard disk the desktop file can be become   bloated and corrupt  think of it as a congress for your mac    every so often its necessary to throw the bums out and start with   a clean slate  fortunately its easier to rebuild the desktop than   to defeat an incumbent              one warning rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments   youve stored in the get info boxes  under system 0 maurice   volaskis freeware init commentkeeper will retain those comments   across a rebuild  commentkeeper also works with system 0 but only    if apples desktop manager extension is also installed              to rebuild the desktop restart your mac and as your   extensions finish loading depress the command and option keys    youll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild   the desktop and warning you that this could take a few minutes    click ok it will take more than a few minutes the more files you   have the longer it will take  if youre running system 0 you may   want to turn off multifinder before trying to rebuild the desktop               if youre experiencing definite problems and not just doing   preventive maintenance you may want to use fifth generations   freeware init desktop reset  desktop reset completely deletes the   desktop file before rebuilding it thus eliminating possibly   corrupt data structures        zap the pram and reset the clock  00        all macs from the original 000k thin mac to the quadra 000   contain a small amount of battery powered ram to hold certain   settings that properly move with the cpu rather than with the disk   such as which disk to boot from  unfortunately this parameter   ram can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes  to reset   it under system 0 hold down the command option p and r keys   while restarting your mac  under system 0 hold down the command   option and shift keys while selecting the control panel from the   apple menu click yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter   ram  since youve erased almost all the settings in the general   control panel you should now reset them to whatever you want              the one setting that zapping the pram does not erase is the    date and time but since the internal clock in the macintosh is   notoriously inaccurate youll probably want to take this   opportunity to reset it anyway    resize the system heap  00         even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most   people still have at least half a row of icons march across the   bottom of their screen every time they restart  all these   extensions and most applications too need space in a section of   memory called the system heap  if the system heap isnt big enough   to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of   it they all start playing king of the mountain on the system heap   knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and   trying to climb back on after they get knocked off  all this   fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance   and almost inevitably crashes the mac             if youre using system 0 your macintosh will automatically   resize the system heap as necessary but if youre running system 0   its important to set your system heap size large enough to manage   all your extensions and applications  by default this size is set   to 000k way too small for most macs with any extensions at all    the system heap size is stored in the normally noneditable boot   blocks of every system disk  bill steinbergs freeware utility   bootman not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks   how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much   needs to be allocated  if youre running system 0 get bootman   use it and be amazed at how infrequently your macintosh crashes    reinstall the system software  00        system files can become corrupt and fragmented especially if   youve stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them    merely updating the system software will often not fix system file   corruption  i recommend doing a clean reinstall  heres how      0  boot from the installer floppy of your system disks       0  copy any nonstandard fonts and desk accessories out          of your system file into a temporary suitcase     0  trash the system file on your hard disk  also trash the          finder multifinder da handler and all other standard apple          extensions like control panel and chooser  these will all be          replaced in the new installation  if youre running or          installing system 0 move everything in the extensions          control panels and preferences folders into the top level          of the system folder     0  rename the system folder  any name other than system folder          is  fine     0  doubleclick the installer script on your system disk  then          choose customize  select the appropriate software for your          model mac and printer  you could do an easy install instead          but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you dont          need that waste your memory and disk space     0  once installation is finished move everything from the          temporary folder you created in step 0 into the new system          folder  if youre asked if you want to replace anything you          forgot to take something out in step 0  youll need to replace          things individually until you find the duplicate piece      0  reinstall any fonts or das you removed in step 0     0  reboot  you should now have a clean defragmented system file          that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable          system overall        disk utilities  00        much like system files hard disks have data structures that   occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even   causing data loss  apple includes disk first aid a simple utility   for detecting and repairing hard disk problems with its system   disks its also available for anonymous ftp from ftpapplecom in   the  directory dtsmacsyssofthdsc  even if you have an earlier    version you should get the latest version 00 from ftpapplecom   and run it on all your hard disks                several companies have released payware disk utilities that   detect and repair considerably more problems than disk first aid   though interestingly none of them detect and repair everything   that disk first aid does  the three most effective for general   work are central points mactools deluxe 00 fifth generations   public utilites and symantecs norton utilities for the macintosh   00  a department or work group should have all of these as well   as disk first aid since none of them fix everything the others do    for individuals mactools 00 street is about half the price of   norton 00 street or public utilities 00 street so features   and ease of use being roughly equal i recommend mactools              all of these products occasionally encounter problems they   cant fix  when that happens its time to backup 00 and   reformat 00        backing up  00        this is one part of preventative maintenance that should be   done a lot more often than every three months  the simplest back   up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies   or other removable media  if you keep your data files separate   from your application and support files then its easy to only back   up those folders which change frequently  nonetheless every three   months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk              a number of programs are available to make backing up   easier  apple included a very basic full backup application with   system 0  with the performas apple ships a new apple backup   utility that can backup the entire disk or just the system folder   onto floppies  the previously mentioned norton utilities for the   mac and mactools deluxe 00 include more powerful floppy backup   utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups             finally if youre lucky enough to have a tape drive network   server or removable media device to use for backups you should   check out the more powerful payware utilities redux 00 street   doesnt support tape drives and diskfit pro 00 street  there   are no freely available backup utilities other than the old hd   backup from system 0      disk defragmentation  00        as disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free   space in the same place to write large files  therefore the   operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be   stored in different places on your hard disk  as files become more   and more fragmented performance can degrade  there are several   ways to defragment a hard disk             the most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your   files erase the hard disk and you might as well reformat while   youre at it  see question 000 and restore all the files              a number of payware utilities including norton utilities for   the mac and mac tools deluxe can defragment a disk in place ie   without erasing it  although the ads for all these products brag   about their safety once youve bought the software and opened the   shrinkwrap they all warn you to back up your disk before   defragmenting it in case something does go wrong  there are no   freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please dont annoy the   net by asking for one     reformat your hard disk  000        just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use so a   hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data  you dont   need to reformat every three months but when your system is   crashing no matter what you try reformatting is the ultimate means   of wiping the slate clean  reformatting your hard disk may even   gain you a few extra megabytes of space  not all hard disks are   created equal  some can hold more data than others  to facilitate   mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks  000   megabytes is the average formatted capacity  your mileage may   vary  apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator   of drive capacity  when you reformat theres no reason at all not   to reclaim whatever unused space apples left on your disk                unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to   initialize them most hard disks come with formatting software    apples disks and system software ship with hd sc setup a minimal   disk formatter which will format apple brand hard drives only    most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with   their hard drives  normally this will be all you need to reformat   your hard disk             a number of generalpurpose formatters are also available   which go beyond the bundled software to include features like   encryption password protection multiple partitioning faster disk   access system 0 compatibility and even compression  two of the   best are the payware drive0 and hard disk toolkit personal edition   00 street for either  while there are one or two freeware   formatters available none are likely to be superior to the ones   bundled with your hard disk              powerbook users should be sure to turn off sleep and   processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter   what software they use  otherwise disk corruption crashes and   data losses are a very good possibility        elliotte rusty harold         department of mathematics   elharoshivanjitedu         new jersey institute of technology

   several weeks ago i described a problem with my apple highresolution monitor and promised to summarize replies received by email to recapitulate occasionally every two or three hours or so my monitor momentarily loses sync the entire raster image bounces down about an eighth of an inch or so then rights itself this usually happens right after i close a large window highlight a large area or do something that radically alters the image on the screen sometimes though it happens with no provocation whatsoever  i have received a bewildering range of replies at one extreme was a man clearly quite knowledgable about monitors who said that the problem was that the 00 monitors power supply simply couldnt always keep up with sudden changes of the raster image the rapid change from a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitors power supply there was no fix available he said because nothing was really wrong i guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that it had to be endured  this seemed quite persuasive and i would have been tempted to adopt an attitude of stoicism except for a reply from a 00 monitor owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the  apple service technical procedures volume 0 under the heading jitter correction the section describes a fix involving the replacement of a capacitor the adjustment of a potentiometer or failing that the swap of a circuit board  i would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had experience with this sort of thing

  a local dealer is offering mac ii vi machines equipped with kodak multi session compatible cdrom drives for what seems like an attractive price 0000 ive used many other models up to a ii ci but this would be the first i could have my own mac is it safe to buy an abouttobe discontinued model such as this id like to yank the cdrom drive out put it in a housing and share it with my pc is this feasible the only info i have on the ii vi is that it is relatively slow 00mhz has an 00000 chip with a math coprocessor i want to add a nonapple portrait monitor and use this machine for hypercard stack design is this a good buy or would i be wasting my money i would appreciate some advice thanks  robert matthews grfg000twnmoe00bitnetedutw  taiwan  
   re methods for attaching heat sink to processor  go to radio shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound it comes in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap  at radio shack its catalog number 0000000  its a mix of silicone and zinc oxide and conducts heat very well  plus its tacky  usually you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink and then bolt or clamp the sink down but if you dont move your mac gravity and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold things in place  just make sure you remember its in there in case you tilt your mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose  you wouldnt want a loose piece of metal running around inside your mac

  writes enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games  the sound driver is pretty ok since its fast sound manager used by the book is useless disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation its too slow  why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon if you are trying to write a game you shouldnt be using sndplay instead make a channel and use buffercmds to play sounds on it it works great you can add callbacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty before it gets empty   the sound driver is so much snappier than sound manager unfortunately system 0 supports it poorly making programs crash occasionally  the moral of the story is to developers dont cheat  well i want my code to work on old systems too i dont know about sys 00 but at least on 000 there are bugs in the sound manager that causes channels to hang with no error message this happends when i keep a channel open for long periods  necessary for performance  and play many sounds stopping sounds halfway callbacks seems not to be reliable then only way i can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel qhead i think it was and the only way i have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an undocumented flag and modify it  callbacks are very reliable i found them 000 reliable even under system 00 i was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on system 00 with the imv documentation  you probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels of course you didnt get called in general if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel with the related slowdown but then when you play more than one you dont work then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel possibly the same one multiple times this might be because you are calling sndplay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them you need to resedit the sound and remove that command then when you create your channel specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channels synth then you can use asynch sndplays all you want youll probably want to switch to buffercmds since you are going to have to use snddocommand anyway to add callbacks  now before you go ahead and tell me i am full of it and the sound manager doesnt work for games remember spectre uses it and it works great if spectre can spare the cpu time you can too  one little disclaimer there are some out there who say the sound manager in the iisi cant be made to work right im not sure either way but i know for sure that you can make your sounds work 000 correctly on every other machine using the sound manager  steve  
   heres another question by a hesitant powerbook purchaser i want to be able to run mathematica and would like to hear some comments   from the gallery about this how much slower does the program run on a   machine without an fpu namely a pb000 versus a machine with an fpu   namely a pb000  what types of calculations get bogged down the most i   primarily due moderately simple algebra integrals which can be dealt with   analytically and plotting including 0d plots i dont do a lot of   numerical work would a pb000 with a lot of memory  and the very nice   video port  be sufficient or should i really try to get an fpu for this   type of work is a pb000 with 0mb faster than a pb000 with 00 or 00mb all comments appreciated   please respond by email  rosssbphyphysicsucsbedu

  here is how i modified my quadra 000 for higher speed previously i had been using a variable speed overdrive for accelerating my cpu but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds  your mileage may vary the top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before hand my personal q000 has tested fine up to 00 mhz thus far i didnt have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds  parts  clock oscillators 0 pin ttl variety you will need a selection of speeds beginning at 00 mhz on up the cpu will run at 00 the oscillator speed the original one is a 00 mhz unit i recommend getting a 00 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one     i obtained my clock oscillators from digikey 00000000000 for    less than 000 each some of their part numbers are     00 mhz ttl clock oscillator part  x000    00 mhz ttl clock oscillator part  x000    00 mhz ttl clock oscillator part  ctx000     dont get the half size clock oscillators they wont fit     there are also cmos clock oscillators i havent tried one in a    quadra they work fine in iisis     socket obtain a 0 pin socket which is in the same form factor as    a 00 pin dip package alternatively use 0 machined socket pins    from an augat style socket just cut them out of the socket  cooling fan a very small 00 volt fan to keep the cpu cool is a     must my vso came with a specially modified heatsink which had    a fan built onto it it had a passthrough connector which    tapped into the hard drive power cable you should rig up     something similar or risk frying your cpu     procedure  0  insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here  0  remove the top lid of the machine you will see the floppy disk and     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower follow the usual antistatic     precautions and of course make sure the machine is off when you do     this unplug all cables wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the mac   0  remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up     the tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply you may     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power     supply leave that alone the plastic tab from the tower is all you     need release   0  look at the rear of the tower assembly you will see the flat ribbon     scsi connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable     leading to the floppy drive disconnect all these from the motherboard     the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed     to release it                                              0  unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount  0  look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower a     phillips head screw is at the base remove it taking care not to drop     it into the case a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful     here  0  remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the     right side of the tower this tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly slide the entire tower assembly 0 cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case  0  remove the interrupt switch assembly it is a strangely shaped plastic     device at the left front edge of the motherboard pull the middle rear plastic prong up and forward the entire device will release  0  unplug the speaker cable squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to     free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case  00 remove the motherboard form the case lift the front right corner of     the motherboard about 0 mm this allows it to clear the clear plastic power light guide slide the motherboard forward about 0 cm the motherboard then comes directly out  00 locate the 00 mhz clock crystal it is a small metal box near the     cpu chip note and remember its orientation the new clock oscillators must be aligned with pin 0 in the same orientation  very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator some of the pins may be bent over simply desolder then unbend them be sure your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board  i used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task this is not appropriate for a first soldering experience the motherboard is a multilayer design with very fine traces  easily damaged without proper care  00 install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was  00 put a 00 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket you could use the old clock but it has solder on its pins this may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problems later i suggest using a new 00 mhz clock  00 install your cooling fan system to complete the modification  00 reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place  00 snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother     board firmly plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard  00 reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 0 cm posterior of its intended position lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case     once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks     into place  00 reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables dontt forget the floppy     drive cable  00 replace the phillips head screw  00 drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in  00 plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount  00 reattach your cables and power cords cross your fingers and turn      on the mac it should make the usual power on chord if it doesnt something is amiss immediately turn of the power and recheck your handiwork if all is not well you have my sincere condolences  hopefully all will work normally turn the machine back off and replace the 00 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one reboot and be astounded   you will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding a particular speed is truly usable with my vso a machine lockup might take 0 hours of operation to occur in the brief time since modifying my clock oscillator 00 hours i have not had a single problem  good luck to all who attempt this modification there is a small but real risk but you could well reach quadra 000 speeds or higher with less than 00 in parts  guy kuo guykuouwashingtonedu

  this poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their iisi clock oscillator i have attempted to gather as many case histories as possible to find some estimate of success and risk the number of replies probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that success rates may be higher than the previous 00 estimate 00 of 00 machines were able to run at 00 mhz when no add on boards were present this is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with  thanks to all who contributed to this poll    issues  speed 00 mhz to 000 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without add on cards all reported machines were able to use 00 mhz as long as no add on cards were present several apple nubus cards were in use no machine with the nubus adapter was able to go faster than 00 mhz one wasnt even able to achieve 00 mhz with the nubus adapter in place  at speeds of 00 and 00 mhz the startup sound is distorted and hi density floppy disk problems have been reported  note unless specifically listed below machines were not tested with a higher speed clock to failure hence the 00 mhz operational machines may well work at higher speeds  damage one user reported pulling out the plating of one pad this was repaired and the machine is operational one other reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator during desoldering there is one second hand report of a user putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron  no reports of static discharge damage  no reports of high speed operation causing damage  then again i also dont have any reports from users of defective parachutes  add on boards compatibility appears to be a problem with apple nubus adapters several other add on boards have been used with success see case histories  heat sinks virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed these were often the to000 style power transistor type some used epoxy some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab of cyanoacrylate glue there was also use of a clamp with a bolt through the hole in the motherboard    case histories  all speeds are the effective cpu speed 00 of clock oscillator all reported cpu versions were 00 mhz  0  000 mhz operational ran for 00 minutes at 00 mhz before crashing     no fpu or other add on card     heatsinked cpu only     on 00 hoursday     no damage during installation     0  000 mhz operational without apple nubus adapter 00 mhz top speed with apple nubus card installed     heatsinked cpu only     on 00 hoursday     no floppy problems     no damage during installation     0  000 mhz operational unable to boot at 00 mhz     heatsinked cpu only     no floppy problems     no damage during installation     0  00 mhz operational     works with the following two configurations    arealtech fpu adaptor card realtech cache card supermac 000 pdqsi  b  supermac fpu adaptor card supermac video spigot supermac 000 pdqsi  000 mhz operational fuzzy startup sound problems with hi density disks  000 mhz operational fuzzy startup sound heat sink on cpu and chip to right of cpu  000 mhz operational occasional crash at 00 mhz  000 mhz operational using fpu rated at 00 mhz without difficulty  000 mhz operational pds adapter with a spectrum 00pdqsi graphics card and a  videospigot a 00mhz fpu heat sink on cpu  0000 mhz operational 00 mhz failed after several hours  0000 mhz operational  000quicksilverfpuonly upgrade   0000 mhz operational tried 00 mhz  system wont start   heat sink on cpu configured with realtech fpuadapter card supermac 000 pdqsi realtech cache cpu on continuously  no problems  floppy works fine at 00mb  00 mhz  00 00 mhz operational heat sink on cpu  00 00 mhz operational heat sink on cpu  00 00 mhz operational heat sink on cpu  00 00 mhz operational heat sink on cpu  00 00 mhz operational heat sink on cpu on 0000 hours per day  00 00 mhz operational heat sink on cpu  cooling fan no floppy problems at 00 mhz  00 00 mhz operational bombed soon after startup at 00 mhz with nubus adapter 00 mhz rated cpu ram 00 ns in slots 00 on motherboard  00 00 mhz operational heat sink added to cpu later no damage while unheatsinked apple nubus adapter with fpu installed  00 00 mhz operational heat sink on cpu  00 00 mhz operational heat sink on cpu  00 00 mhz operational heat sink on cpu  00 00 mhz operational heat sink on cpu  guy kuo guykuouwashingtonedu   
  anyone have a phone number for applied engineering so i can give them a call   ae is in dallastry 0000000000 or 0000000000  tech support may be on their own line but one of these should get you started  good luck   
   the cd000 external is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile now  demand for the units are high so they are pretty rare  ive seen them   listed for around 000000 at local computer stores and the campus mac   reseller  ive also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of cds  i had mention in a previous article that i was searching for the 000 external drive  i did call apple catalog as recommended and they told me the drives were back ordered until may 0  i placed an order anyways and two days later i had a visit from federal express  well you can guess how i spent my weekend of course i ended up paying list price but you do get a free copy of pc exchange when you order from the apple catalog  you may want to check if they have any internal drives  btw an older version of gatekeeper i dont recall which version hung up my mac when trying to access a photocd or audio disk  i got the newer version which did mention a conflict with the apple 0xx cd driver  
  looking for a mac pb 000 thats in good condition brand new wwarranty would be ideal  it should also include the external floppy drive and have at least a 00 meg internal hard drive with 0 meg of ram  so if you have a pb000 that youd like to turn into cash please write me  thanks very much  billyirvinecom billyb  bouncer

  my recently modified quadra 000 with a socket for clock oscillators has now completed nearly 00 hours of error free operation at 00 mhz with a 00 mhz clock oscillator i have also tried a 00 mhz cmos clock and that works as well on the more stupid side ive discovered you can use a 00 mhz clock and make your q000 as slow as a centris 000 however a 00 mhz clock which would have yielded a 000 mhz quadra 000 whod want one didnt work at all  impatiently awaiting a 00 mhz clock         guy kuo guykuouwashingtonedu

  i read in a recent tidbits0000 about the possibility of putting a 00000 in a pb000 i am interested in doing so but would like to know more about it does it involve just replacing the 00000 that is on the daughterboard or does it involve getting a new daughter board also would the 00000 be able to run qt with the pb000s screennot pretty i know but possible and of course what would the damage be  any info would be appreciated thanks in advance jay fogel

   yes i know computers and harddisk drives should be always on but what about monitors they generate a lots of heat should i or shouldnt i keep them on 00 hours a day any advice thanks take carepaul   i vote for turning them off at night  the stress of offon is a little  harmful so dont turn it off then back on an hour later etc but turning them off for 00 hours or overnight is a good idea  the electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight along with heat   we have a lot of 00year old machines in the basement that still work but who cares they are off 00 hours a day

   i wonder how hard it would be ie what it would add to the cost to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than some amount of time  i believe that apple sun and a number of other desktop machine manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate powersaving techniques  this is also something that governments in other countries are likely to require in the future so expect to see it  this may include the ability for the system to fully power down the monitor via a controllable power outlet and power it back on automatically  is this a sell on screen saver software companies  goals for idle power consumption have been set at something like 00 watts for the system not including the monitor  dont quote me on this  note that in many businesses the savings will be substantial especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for the night would save the company sun itself on the order of 0m per year  putting other and automatic powersaving features in would probably have greater than double that value  given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and home computers on getting faxes automatically getting email  building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to cut 0 off the national power consumption based on data i heard  btw when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving work it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors with the power switch on front  there was some indication that monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate lots of power cycling  this may only apply to the monitors we use but might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in back

  can someone tell me which of the files that come with dw00 go where and for what purpose  what can be left out for instance if you dont want to do background printing  as far as i can remember all you need to do to get your deskwriter up and printing using the 00 driver is to drag the driver itself either serial or appletalk depending on your needs to the system folder you dont need the fonts or anything else if all you want is straight forward bare bones basic printingi dont have anything else installed and can still print on a deskwriter using sys00 and hp driver 00 tony   the views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only  bbs number000 0000000      maccontent is victoriaõs first iconic bbs    
  hi everyone       im experiencing a very annoying problem with background printing on the hp deskwriter sys 00 deskwriter driver 00 powerbook 000 when i print from say ms word i see the message spooling to disk but sometimes nothing prints checking my memory map thanks to now menus i see that hp backgrounder has not loaded restarting fixes this it seems to me that hp backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly and that its status as multifinder not aware allows it to do this without my being informed by a message such as hp backgrounder quit unexpectedly have you ever seen this problem before         there may or may not be a related problem i have experienced problems in putting my computer to sleep choosing sleep from the finder menu sometimes does nothing today on a whim i checked the memory map and i discovered that hp backgrounder was not loaded restarted reloaded hp backgrounder and i was able to put my machine to sleep as usual just a mere coincidence or is the hp backgrounder crash preventing my machine from going to sleep has anyone seen this problem im seriously considering the purchase of a stylewriterii because of the poor quality of the hp software   please send your answers directly to me and post to the net yours truly marc bizer

  has anybody heard about a thing called a macwatch i saw it on tv a couple of years ago it is a watch with a reviever and a transmitter for your mac the practical upshot is that your mac can page your watch and display a small message my flatmate is off to the states for a week or two soon and i am interested in getting one any info would be appreciated  thanx in advance glenn

  i was reading a review of the centris 000 in this  months macworld and the reviewer said that for  0 you could make an adjustment on the clock speed of the chip and change it from 00mhz to 00mhz  i  havent heard of this before and i dont think that this is the 000 chip replacement with fpu that i have seen so much talk about  anyone have any ideas cweraduedu      
  the article was probably referring to changing the clock oscillator in a manner similar to that done on quadra 000s and iisis i havent read a report of this actually being done on a centris 000 but supposedly this also works on q000 q000 and centris 000 machines

      the origional bit is missing but longshort follows      the origional poster asked if heshe could use any old vgasvga monitor with a centris hence title        the answer ot this question is an unqualified yes  you can use any old vgasvga monitor with a centris  you do need an adaptor i use a mac vgaq from james engineering 000 0000000 to run between the two machines  the adaptor i have mentioned will convert a centris to a three row vgasvga 00 pin adaptor for your monitor      now the special interest disclaimer  the above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 000x000 resolution  if your monitor will sync to 00khz horizontal the above adaptor will allow you to choose 000x000 resolution i prefer this on my 0000s  then you have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates  i would advocate calling james engineering because they seem to have a clue  as to the comment by the person who said dont bother calling apple because they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue     apple will treat you like a fking assanine idiot for even considering going third party and if you want this treatment wants you to pay for their thech support line the supposedly compitantly one and then still has no fu clue  personal experience  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers doesnt see to extend to macs sony magnavox  in addition to this to find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the sync rates elsewhere as ads like hardware that fits  that rate monitor resolutions give the most favorable rating which usually means you can get this if you use a specialized application video cardie well you can get a resolution 0000x000 on this 0  0 super smelly sock monitor that will let you display two full pages side by side  all you need is our reasonably priced oder eater video board for 00000 and it will give you an ultra fast horizontal sync rate of six fast kilohertz and three khz vertical    note  with the sony 0000 at least on the centris 000 built in video board using an 000x000 adaptor there is a boarder of an inch  to the sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as possible  using a 000x000 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an inch                                                                      a

  hi do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture   apple uses in the powerbook duos  or in the powerbook in general  what are the factors that make the duo 000 so slow compared to a desktop   machine running the same processor at the same speed 00mhz 00000  how many   wait states are in the memory system etc  what kind of a data bus does it   use  00bit or 00bit    its still slow when plugged into a duodock  anyone know in general what kind of shortcuts notebook manufacturers take when   making notebooks  i heard of a 000dx000 notebook getting a whopping 00   mips rating  a similar desktop machine should be getting about 0 times that   i guess  avery  
  we are having a problem with a quadra 000 that has stumped a couple of techs sent to us by the vendor as well as us  this quadra is stuffed with 00mb ram 0mb vram and some large disk 000mb i think what happens is that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry loses vertical sync it is quite apparent that the mac cpu is still ok and the problem really seems to lie with the video circuitry since you can still save your documents quit your aplpications even pull down menus etc only the display is scrolling lik crazy so its pretty hard to hit menu items  we had the original logic board replaced twice now and the same problem has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has varied the first board had this problem every about 0hr more often if the cache was turned off yes off  this is the only symptom that is not obviously related to the video circuitry after all the cache is on the cpu right the second board had the problem every about 00 minutes we did not keep it rather we put the original back the current board we have has this problem a lot less often has gone about a week without doing it but did it twice within an hour yesterday the technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty sharp and tried a number of sensible things most of which we had previously tried ourselves anyway these included swapping the ram swapping the vram swapping monitors 0 different 00 apple rgb and 0 00 apple rgb swapping cables disconnecting hd and booting from floppy sacrificing various small mammals here are some other facts when we put a rasterops procolor 00 on the nubus the problem is fixed  it does not occur with the internal video or the procolor video out the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards  that exhibit it in our lab apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards  that they cannot find anything wrong with and getting them shipped back as  faulty according to us here are some speculations i bet that neither apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that  much ram and vram on them simultaneaously which may have something to do  with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem though we can  reproduce it with just 0mb of ram so this is probably a red herring the vendors representative blames metal in your walls  claims that our  walls have metal in them which interferes with the macs operation we  have another 000 in the lab which works like a charm though its not in  the exact same spot please dont tell me this is probably it i do  not want to believe it its probably not poltergeists since they do not have badges to get past  security at the entrance to our site  has anyone any ideas please please email as well as posting cause i seem to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less time available to read news  thank you in advance carlo tiana nasa ames research center carlovisionarcnasagov   carlocvsrochesteredu       carlowhitestanfordedu         we always remember you have a choice carlovisionarcnasagov

      hi     i have been told by a local sales that asante has come out with this    lciii pds ethernet adapter with an optional 00000 socket on the board    my question is will the fpu performance degrade will i put the 00000    on the pds card socket instead of on the motherboard itself intuitively    the math coprocessor should always be placed close to the cpu but    i am not sure how good apples socalled processordirect slot is when    it comes to throughout does anyone know the answer to this or have    any experience with the asante lciii ethernet adapter thanks in advance  from what ive heard the pds slot clock is only 00mhz to be compatible with the old lc style boards while the fpu socket close to the cpu is clocked at 00mhz  i guess a board designed for the lciii can get a 00mhz clock from the extended pds socket  real life      thomas törnblom           email  thomastornblomnexuscommse snail mail     communicator nexus ab     phone  00 00 000000                 box 000                   fax    00 00 000000                 s  000 00 uppsala sweden  
  in 0r0t0finnq0csenatorbedfellowmitedu thewhoathenamitedu derek a fong writes  is there an extension cord type cable i can buy which allows me to plug my existing power cord into and then plug this extension cable into my quadra   there are two approaches  0 if your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the monitor most common you can get a replacement power cord that will go from the monitor to the back of the computer  0 you can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the computer  both cost about the same aprox 0 and are available from many computer stores clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at good prices power cords are standard so you dont have to go looking for some special thing at a mac store

  the most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than the smaller one if your running the drive on a mac i would recommend a shareware utility called timedrive which tests seek scsi throughput and rotational speed this utility should let you know what the differences are between the drives   the views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only  bbs number000 0000000      maccontent is victoriaus first iconic bbs   larger drives tend to have multipule platters which can allow adjacent bits to be read in parallel resulting in higher throughput  they also have higher spindle speeds which leads to both increased throughput and reduced seek times due to reduction of rotational latency  erik speckman

  the first problem was the sound  i tried the m0 but then even the logon was muted  i dont want that  any other suggestions for that hissing  the second is really strange  first i kept mentioning that fc slowed down all the time and took too long  well i just logged on with extensions off and i didnt have any slowdown  also last time i was online i quit which usually disconnects and quits  it disconnected but it wouldnt quit  i had to force quit and then when i launched fc again it said the modem port was in use  this is really strange  i thought it might have to do with fax software  or the restart could have reset the modem port a more likely explanation  so any suggestions  david   from planet bmug the firstclass bbs of bmug  the message contained in  this posting does not in any way reflect bmugs official views

  hi  i own a iisi and im considering buying a powerbook  can anyone give me a listing of all the models and tell me what im looking for ie passive matrix vs active memory sizes upgradeability internal modems disk size  if you could provide some prices too that would help  im not informed enough on powerbooks to know how well they operate   i have been following the posts on some of the problems that have been encountered such as the trackball not working in the horizontal i would appreciate the list as well as any advice you may have  thanks in advance kordi a wichita state university

  ive been playing with a centris 000 0000 for the last couple weeks  the only problem that i have seen is that a couple of the applications i run are incompatible with the 000s processor cache so i have to run with it turned off actually the main thing i dont like it is that it doesnt have a software poweruppowerdown and the power switch is directly under the floppy drive  i havent hit it thinking it would eject the disk but some tired night im going to be really upset with that design decision  in all no problems with it floppy and printing have been just fine  printing is done across a localtalk net not a directly connected printer  bill

  so what does the net think did the dealer just get one flaky machine or did apple send the c000 out the door too early is your c000 working just great or is it buggy too  my 000 is working like a charm in fact if 000s are flaky i would consider it a great computer even if i had to return a couple to apple to get a good one     samuel christian zehrzeh0midwayuchicagoedu bio computing labswhitman 000 000 e 00th stchicago il 00000

  in the last two weeks i have the following problem on two 000s  0 has a 0mb simm and the other a 0 mb simm both are about 0 0 months old bought from different vendors and installed by different people   both computers begin crashing frequently locking up and ultimately the memory chimes  crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen and sometimes would occur when you werent even touching the computer  in both cases taking the machine apart taking the memory out and putting it back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback  my marginally educated guess as to whats happening is that larger simms are lopsided in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after time they begin to move about  possible because of pressure on the keyboard or something    anyway has anyone else had such a problem or solution  if somehow you could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving  ive had no problem for the past 0 weeks by replacing my 0mb simm with a 0mbsimm although this is not desireble solution  please email any resp  andor post if usefull to the rest of the world  ted    ted schreiber mechanical enginering  northwestern university tel 0000000000 fax 0000000000 email rtsnwuedu

  erik adams writes  i am looking at a new lc iii and a used iici  prices   the iici has much greater potential for expansion a la nubus and  greater memory capacity  how important is this how many nubus cards do you haveplan to acquire how much memory do you really need ive got a ci and 00mb of ram thats plenty i also have a 00bit graphics card on the nubus  im a sucker for pretty picturesi think the lciii can have a bootable ramdisk in memory which a ci can not have at least not out of the box   the lc iii would be new under warranty newer roms is the iici  00bit clean and would have sound input  i also like the  pizzabox case  the ci is 00bit clean i solved the sound input problem with a macrecorder but thats gotten to be a fairly expensive solution now that macromind owns macrecorder   performancewise i have read that they are almost identical the  lc iii being a little slower  the actual difference is probably not worth worrying over    so which should i get  depends on the price you can get the ci for educationally speaking the 000  lciii here at fsu can be had at just under 0000 add in roughly 000 for a monitor last id heard an 0mb lciii simm went for 000   i think youre in a winwin situation no matter what you decide youll most likely be happy with it  james

   according to what i saw in a store today the performa 000 is not the same as an lciii  it only has a 00mhz 00000 while the lciii has a 00mhz 000 correct me if i am wrong because it is possible that the dealer may have forgotten to remove the description that was next to the actual computer dealers who sell the performa are known to have about as much knowledge about macs as i do about dos machines  saurabh

  i thought id share a good experience too  i bought the aps quantum 000 zero footprint drive in may 00 back when they still used two separate leds on the front panel and the case was metal  while traveling with it it was in my se00 mac bag on top of the mac this past winter one of the plastic tabs holding the front panel on broke so that the right side of the front panel was coming forward away from the rest of the drive  i lived with this situation until it became completely intolerable which more or less coincided with a network shutdown at school and a trip out of town i had to take which gave me some dead time during which to have the drive sent out  i called aps for an rma  and got one with no questions asked about how the tab got broken it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers  though nothing else was damaged well except for the internal speaker in my modem which wasnt that well glued down to begin with  yeah yeah im never flying with my se00 again  and when i called back to ask whether i could send it in a little later rather than right away they had no problem with that  even when i exceeded the normal valid period for an rma  by a day theyre usually good for 00 days  the front panel was replaced under warranty and the drive was shipped back quickly i mailed it first class insured on a saturday by noon from la to missouri and it came back by fed ex by friday i dont know exactly what day it came back because i was traveling that week from wednesday afternoon to sunday afternoon  the only thing that couldve been bad was that the first service rep i talked to in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data suggested that i take the drive mechanism out and send just the case  unfortunately i discovered the day i was mailing the thing that would necessitate breaking the little seal and thus voiding the warranty  oh well  al albertseasuclaedu

  according to the official documentation failure to use the iifx terminator can not only affect scsi bus performance but can also damage the bus whether this is your problem or not i dont know i have had sporadic scsi problems with my iifx since i bought it i cannot connect more than three devices fourth one causes major problems  first thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system if you continue to get errors it is probably the drive if it formats fine then i would try to format it on your system with no externals if this  fails then the scsi controller on your iifx needs repairreplacement  hope this helps     david c salmon salmonunomahaedu  have you tried having your scsi bus balanced  greg

  i have an old apple rgb monitor for a iigs which looks a whole lot like the 00 monitor  i have the sneaking suspicion that if i had the right cable i could use it on my mac  does anyone know if my suspicions are correct or am i just full of it  mkd

  i ordered an external floppy drive from them 0 years ago  when i placed the order they said it was in stock and would ship the next day  a week passed and no drive  i called them up and they said they were out of stock and my drive should ship in 0 weeks or so  since i needed the drive right away both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead i cancelled my order and havent dealt with them since   chris kidwell ck00andrewcmuedu   i too had a very unpleasant experience with hardware thats shi it featured repeated lies about when things had shipped a salesperson who was totally ignorant about what he was selling a charge for duties i had specifically been assured were not payable and then a monitor their house brand 0page monochrome that was the most unadulterated piece of junk it has ever been my misfortune to experience in the world of electronics  i shipped it back and they refunded my money but it still cost me something over 000 for long distance charges nonrefundable taxes and duties and lost time  dont deal with them   
   i used to hate it when people posted messages like this but now that i am contemplating a purchase i can see why they do  so has anyone heard of any upcoming within the next 0 months advances in the powerbook line  can we expect to see a powerpc powerbook at some point in the future i assume an 000 would take too much power and generate too much heat for installation in a powerbook  thanks for your help  
  what is the actual clock speed of a centris 000 00 mhz or 00 mhz  thanks in advance      peter white pw0000cscalbanyedu pwhitemacarchiveumichedu  
  a friend of mine who owns a pc said that he recently got a program that can format a disk that can exceed the normal capacity of a hd disk apparently it rewrites the driver or takes or the driver or something that allows it get more space out of a normal hd floppy disk  it supposedly gets upto 00 megs so something like 0000k i dont have the program  since i cant use it and its supposed to be called something like form00 or something like that  my question is whether its possible to do this on the mac and if its not possible is it due to hardware limitations a developer friend of mine said that it might be possible but he doesnt deal with this aspect of the field much  thanks for any information contributed   steve    
  i hooked up an old 00meg external mac hardrive to a powerbook 000  i  reformatted the drive copied all the files from the powerbook except the systemfolder deleted the files from the powerbook my biggest error sigh and then rebooted the whole set up and chimes of death i get the following sad mac error  00000f 000000 i ran norton and it claims its a bad scsi driver and suggests replaceing it i used apples disk tools but i couldnt update the hardrives scsi driver as it claimed it was in use but i couldnt even mount the thing though i could see it when checking the scsi bus after turning it on after booting my machine first  what does that error above refer to  am i on the right track  is there anything i can do short of intialising the drive since i need the data on there  thanks ed bourne

  i have a question for yall  im looking at an ad for the new 00 fast scsi0 drives from micropolis in the june 0000 macworld i have seen similar ads for the ide versions in ibm pc magazines  well the ad says that all three drives have a fast scsi0 interface but then it says that the dtr rate for each drive is 0 megabytessecond max  how can this be  i thought that if a drive was to be fast scsi0 it had to have a dtr of 00megs a second  i am assuming the 0megssec claim by micropolis is from the 000k cache i admit that i would be very impressed if the drive can readwrite data at 0megs a second  thank you

    a friend is heavily into midi and is using a quadra 000 maybe 000 with  all but one nubus slot populated with arcane music hardware and a video card  he reports 0 bit video is too slow for good realtime display of what he needs to see  he also reports that the builtin video is even worse  hes not a mac guru and i havent seen the system so this is about all i know  i suspect that his nubus is heavily loaded and think improvements might come from a switch to an accelerated pds slot video card  does this sound right  who makes a pds accelerated video card for the quadra thats worth looking at  any other suggestions  thanks in advance  email  agorskimitreorg        arthur m gorski        000 0000000 snail  the mitre corporation 0000 nasa road one houston texas 00000  
  in c0ydqc0jkcsuiucedu scottcsuiucedu jay scott writes  a rep at the dealer actually its a university order center so they dont have any immediate financial interest told me that they have been having lots of problems with their centris 000 he didnt go into details but mentioned problems with the floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files it sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems and software compatibility problems with the machine  hes not recommending the centris 000 to anybody he says to consider a centris 000 or a iivx why he would recommend a iivx over an lciii i dont know but thats what he said  so what does the net think did the dealer just get one flaky machine or did apple send the c000 out the door too early is your c000 working just great or is it buggy too  jay scott scottcsuiucedu  sounds to me like your dealer really wants to get rid of the iivxs he has in stock  i can imaging that they are getting hard to sell given that   0 a c000 is way faster and is comparable in price  0 an lciii is about the same speed and is way cheaper so your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people that iivxs are a much better buy than a c000 just so he can get rid of all his old stock  no disrespect to dealers or the iivx intended   jon nielsen joncsuwaeduau department of computer science university of western australia

  i have some questions about this subject  i like to leave my computer on if i think im going to be using it withing the next 0 or 0 hours but i get sick of my dad constantly coming up to me and asking why is the computer on if youre not using it  i also wonder about my computer being harmed by fluctuations in voltage from other things garbage disposal etc  here are my questions   how much harm do voltage fluctuations cause  my computer does not share a circuit with anything big but our my light dims when a refrigerator comes on or the garbage disposal is turned on whose doesnt and also when the washing machine does anything  all these things cause a drop in voltage which is harmful to a computer right  i also notice the fan in my system saver turning at different speeds  is it safer to turn it off and back on when i want to use it or to leave it on   how much electricity does my computer use  i have an apple iigs ne flames with a kensington system saver gs 0 electric fan inside an applecolor rgb monitor and an external 00 hd 0 fan and its own ps  how do i translate this into kilowatthours  also how much of this is used by the monitor   does the monitor use considerably less juice when the screen is totally black but still on   many computers spin the hd up and down constantly to save power  i always thought this was harmful to the hd and defeats the purpose of leaving the computer on in the first place except portables  is this true   thanks for the info  i think this will help lots of people   stacy
