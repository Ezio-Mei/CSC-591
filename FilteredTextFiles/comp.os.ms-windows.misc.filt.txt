     doublespace although i do not trust it for my hard disks sounds  great for floppies the thouoght of having to mount the disk  is anoying but something i can deal with the problem arises   when under windows is there a way to mount and unmount while  under windows or is this part of the upgrades soon to be   available from other vendors     chris   i cant see why you would not trust it because it is safer than any previous compression programs it integrates into the kernal and makes it nearly impossible to delete

  does anyone know a program that will record keyboard sequences that i  do in a windowed dos box i would like to have something that starts a telnet program and then logs me into my accounts windows recorder doesnt seem to be able to record the key sequences  thanks steve  i think you would need a dos macro program  superkey by borland comes to mind  i dont think windows is capable of sending keystrokes to a dos window  what you want to do sounds like a security problem to me though  tom paladinworldstdcom

   i have been posting monthly howtosetup a slip client on a pc posts for a  few months  lots of work and imminent graduation have come in the way of  posting one of these for march or earlier this month  for which i apologize  this file includes information on writing a script for university of minnesota phone and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with  phone   for additions modifications and corrections i can be reached at ashokbiochemistrycwruedu  best wishes ashok   begin sliptxt  based on my experiences on setting up slip under dos and windows  here are my comments on setting up slip in this environment  i thank the trumpet beta testers and the cwru slip beta testers for their comments   configuring your modem  a turn off dtr atd0w    i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use    to dial my slip server qmodem drops dtr when i exit the program    and therefore hangs up the line  if you use a program like kermit    or conex to establish the slip connection then this need not be done    these programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit     note if you use univ of minn phone to dial and establish a          slip connection you do not need to turn off dtr  b dial and establish the slip connection first  this can be done    automatically if you use a program like phone from the university of    minnesota which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the    slip packet driver  the phone scripting language is simple and    phone scripts can be easily written to configure phone to work with    other slip server  in addition while the only packet driver    that phone works with is umslip currently it is easy to write a    batch file hack that lets phone work with other packet drivers    there is a section on phone in the document with both script and    batch file examples   configuring the slip drivers  there are five slip packet drivers commonly available cslipperexe    peter tattams compressed slip driver slipperexe     peter tattams slip driver slip0000com    crynwr driver i like phil burns modified driver etherslcom     crynwr driver ethernet simulation over slip umslipcom      univ of minnesota driver based on slip0000  of these four i vastly prefer cslipperexe over slip0000com or etherslcom for the following reasons  a it is much faster even though my modem has just a 00000 uart b while using etherslipslip0000umslip myself and several others    have noticed that the pc clock gets messed up after performing a    long ftp transfer c it supports pktmux when used in ethernet simulation mode d when used in ethernet simulation mode cslipper seem to work with    every tcpip application that i have tested it with  instructions for cslipperexe and you do not use phone a load slipper in your autoexecbat file according to instructions    for instance if you have a v00bis modem on com0    slipper com0 vec00 baud00000 b if you use dos tcpip applications in win 00 dos boxes then use the    doubleended packet driver shim winpktcom  this creates a virtual    packet driver at 0x00  dos applications in native mode dos    applications in windows 00 dos boxes and windows applications can all    use this virtual driver at 0x00    winpktcom 0x00 0x00 c if you use qvtnet load pktintcom next  qvtnet is configured in    qvtnetini to use the interrupt at 0x00    pktintcom  instructions for slip0000com a try getting a version 00 slip driver  philip burns of northwestern    university has a modified slip0000com driver that is better at hardware    handshaking  this driver is distributed along with nupop b load the driver after establishing the slip connection  my modem is a    v00bis modem on com0 so here is how i would load the driver    slip0000 w 0x00 h 0 slip 0x00f0 00000 c as discussed above if you use dos tcpip applications in windows 0x    dos boxes you probably want to use winpktcom    winpktcom 0x00 0x00 d if you use winqvtnet load pktintcom    pktintcom  instructions for etherslcom if you choose to use etherslcom instead of slip0000com the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference  you will have to delete the line devicevcd from the 000enh section of systemini  this will interfere with running regular windows comm applications such as crosstalk and you will get lots of dropped characters etc in these applications  this is therefore not recommended  etherslip would be loaded as    ethersl w 0x00 h 0 0x00f0 00000  configuring windows 00  a make the following modifications to the systemini file 000enh    section    i list all your com ports with their addresses and interrupts        com0base00f0        com0irq0        com0base00f0        com0irq0        com0base00e0        com0irq0        this can also be done from within windows  control panel        but doubleclicking on the ports icon    ii give the port to which your modem is attached a generous com buffer        com0buffer00000    iii change the com port autoassign value for the com port that you wish        to use for your modem to zero  this is the amount of time that        windows waits in seconds before handing control of that com port to        another application  if you use winqvtnet and then want to switch        from one session to another and this value is at the default value        of 0 seconds you are will get a gpf and windows will crash        com0autoassign0        this can also be done from within windows  control panel        doubleclick on 000 enhanced and under device contention set        the device contention for the com port your modem is on to        never warn  additional notes  what to do if you are assigned a different ip address for each slip session  i am fortunate in that our campus slip server assigns each user a permanent ip address so i do not have worry about editing qvtnetini each time that i establish a slip connection  if you are assigned a new ip address on every occasion that you dial in please try to use bootp aware software and let bootp do the configuration for you  however qvtnet is not bootp aware and rarp will not work over a slip connection  to get qvtnet working in a situation such as this you must do the following  edit the qvtnetini file  let the net section look like this  net name ip netmask0000000000 or whatever is appropriate for you arptime00 packetvector00 or whatever is appropriate  save the changes and then writeprotect this file attrib r qvtnetini  start your slip connection and remember the name and ip address that you are assigned  each time you start qvtnet 00x the general configuration dialog box will open  enter the name and ip address and you were assigned for that session click on ok and you should be up and running  the changes you make will not be saved as qvtnetini is writeprotected  a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip address assignment is provided by victor menayang victorccwfccutexasedu victor uses the program bootpq to semiautomate qvtnet preparation bootpq is used to inquire the assigned ip which is then saved to a file called myip  another file noip is essentially a complete qvtnetini file that lacks the ip address  in the final step myip and noip are copied into a single qvtnetini file  an example of victors batch file is provided below  slipper com0 pktintcom bootpq i ips   myip bootpq i my ip is s copy q net  myip  noip ecomqvtnetqvtnetini del q myip echo off echo  echo ready to run winqvtnet  for questions and more details about bootpq please contact victor menayang victorccwfccutexasedu  qpc software is attempting to add bootp capability to winqvtnet  how do you use pktmux over slip  pktmux will not work over the slip0000com packet driver and crashes immediately if used with etherslcom  pktmux will work with cslipperexe when cslipper is used in ethernet simulation mode  an example of this configuration is shown below  the latest release of pktmux is 00c and it is important that you use this version if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like trumpet for windows to be released very shortly  from autoexecbat  lh cslipper com0 vec00 baud00000 ether         packet driver lh pktmux 0 00 0       pktmux loaded for 0 virtual packet drivers lh pktdrv 0f 00         first virtual packet driver used for qvtnet lh pktintcom           qvtnet pktintcom pktdrv 00 00            pktdrv for use in native dos or wintrumpet  additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within windows 00 dos boxes  for example my pif file to load popmail is directed to the file popmailbat  this is what popmailbat reads like  pktdrv 00 00            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x00 cd popmail popmail cd  pktdrv 00 u            unloads the packet driver at 0x00 exit                    causes the dos window to close  i have similar batch files that load other dos tcpip applications like pc gopher  it is my experience that pktmux works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual dos sessions are loaded at the same software interrupt  for example within two different dos boxes  one for popmail and the other for gopher the virtual packet driver pktdrv is loaded at 0x00 in each instance  how much does pktmux degrade the performance of cslipper  i have a v00bisv00bis modem in a 00000 running windows 00 with a reasonably fast video card ati graphics ultra  under these conditions when i have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows a driver at 0x0f  qvtnet ftp client session b driver at 0x00 in one dos window  cutcp tn0000 session c driver at 0x00 in another dos window  trumpet for dos  i get ftp transfer rates of 00  00 kbsec while transferring compressed files  this rate is comparable to that which i get with slip0000 loaded as a packet driver and where a single tcpip session is active  if cslipper is used a packet driver and a single session is active i get transfer rates of 00  00 kbsec on the same files  while there is about 00 degradation in the performance of slipper for me the benefits of being able to use pktmux outweigh the performance hit  cslipper and ethernet simulation mode  in ethernet simulation mode cslipper ver 00 works with all the applications that i have tested it with  one or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at cslipper 00 but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver 00  when slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode and used with pktmux i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that reads ipincorrect packet type or ipbad version number  this does not seem to prevent qvtnet from functioning although i cannot comment on loss of performance  what can you do if your dos tcpip application does not work with cslipper in ethernet simulation mode  in the rare event that you find a package that does not work with cslipper in ethernet simulation mode first contact the author  peter tattam  peterpsychnetpsycholutaseduau and let him know  chances are that he can fix it  in the meanwhile you can try the following  i do not know if it is kosher but it worked when i had problems with cslipper ver 00  cslipper is loaded at 0x00 as described above under the pktmux section  i load etherslcom at 0x00 run the application and then terminate etherslcom  this also works within windows 00 virtual dos boxes  however a packet driver like ethersl can be used in only one virtual dos box at a time  so for example here is my batch file to run grateful med a medical reference retrieval program developed at the national library of medicine  ethersl w 0x00 h 0 0x00f0 00000       loads etherslip cd gm0 search cd  termin 0x00                             terminates etherslip exit            closes the dos box and returns me to windows  if you use this method be cautious about one thing  dont have any active pktmux dos sessions open at the same time  after closing the ethersl window you can run your pktmux dos sessions with no problem  btw the example above  grateful med works with no problems with cslipper ver 00  phone script files  the documentation that accompany phone provide good instructions on writing script files to get phone to dial slip servers other than the university of minnesota server  for example here is a script that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend  background  to start a slip connection i dial our terminal server and login with a username and password  after doing so i start a slip session with the following command slip usernameslipdialincwruedu followed by my password  again  here then is the relevant portion of the phonecmd script file    cwruts0 slip login script by ashok aiyar 00000  last

the quick answer  there is no clean way  below is a batch file hack that i wrote to use phone with other packet drivers  in this example the packet driver is peter tattams cslipper  to use a batch file like this you must know the parameters with which you plan to use the packet driver  ie interrupt vector baud rate port address and irq  this batch file requires umslipcom cslipperexe and termincom to be in the same directory or in your path   all that the batch file does is to let you dial the slip connection using phone load the appropriate packet driver hangup the connection and unload the driver when you are done    being cwruslipbat  echo off rem   this batch file is an ugly hack of u of minn slipbat rem   awaiting a version of cslipper that can directly interact rem   with

          i am having something very unusual happen  first  some background on my system  i have a mitsubishi 00 meg hard drive  and am running smartdrv the version that comes with windows 00 on  it  i rarely use windows  i use a program called disk technician  gold v000 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive  it works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file or if there is anything else is wrong with it  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting  my hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors  i usually end up with 0 new bad  sectors a week           heres what happened  i ran a program and dtg broke in with  an emergency warning and recommended i reboot  it gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded  i exited the program  and did just this  dtg went through its bootup process examining  for new errors etc and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time           i then went back to the program executed it again and the  exact same error was detected  i rebooted and tried again and the  same error happened again  so i removed dtg from memory and went  to the program to see if i could detect anything wrong  sure enough  there was a number of read attempts  so i rebooted and reloaded dtg  but removed the cache  i executed the program  no read errors  either audible or detected by dtg  i quit the program loaded the  cache and ran the program again  the errors were detected           ok so the errors are there and dtg detects but doesnt fix  them when the cache is loaded  when the cache is not loaded there are  no errors  so to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files i went into xtree gold and tagged all files and searched them  for a random string in other words i wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive  before i got through  the cs dtg had detected at least six errors and recommended i reboot           does anybody have any idea why smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive  oh there are exactly two misreads per file and 0 in  about every 000 files are affected             i originally posted this message to disk technician corps  system but i figured someone out in netland may know enough about  smartdrv to help me out                       internet  jdrivernetlinkctscom john driver uucp   ryptydenetlinkjdriver netlink online communications  public access in san diego ca 000 0000000

  ive been running dos 0 for about a month  i was generally impressed with the improvements  the multiple boot configurations were great the new commands were nice and doublespace worked fine twice as slow for large data transfers twice as fast for small with smartdrv  until now  this morning at 0 am while i was working on my research paper i had to reboot a hung dos program that did no disk io from within windows 00 when my machine finished rebooting i found my windows directory and about two thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted  i cannot afford problems like this  im returning to dos 0  mark  ps  ive also noticed bad sector errors from doublespace where none should       exist

   word 00c doesnt show the periodcentred character to indicate spaces if i use the ttfonts from coreldraw  our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box  they overlap each other and characters on each side which is useless  i believe the character used by w0w is the periodcentred 0000 this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this  i have edited the corel font with fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0000 character makes no difference to the font output in charmap or w0w altering the paragraph 0000 or cedilla 0000 does alter their font graphics displayed however  is the w0w character used to indicate spaces the periodcentred character   has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a coreldraw ttf                                                                              russ sharp    russdeakineduau    ph 00000 0000    fax 00000 0000     deakin university school of engineering  technology geelong australia

   hello again  about a week and onehalf ago i posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers  specifically a comparison between the canon bj000 bubblejet and the hewlettpackard deskjet 000  many people asked me to post the summaryaccount of all the postings and email i received  below is my original query and the responses i received  i have not deleted any part of the responses only the headers and signatures so you can extract what you find necessary  some people asked me for an unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer  there are a wide range of comments each has its own value    there was no clear winner some like the bj000 especially its priceperformance ratio others preferred the durability and reliability of the deskjet the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background  two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention a new printer to be introduced by hewlettpackard later this year around summertime and an addition to the epson product line their first inkjet  you will find that after the initial purchase the costs of refilling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same this largely depends on where you purchase the refills or replacements  so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer  no one mentioned approx how many sheets each ink cartridge will print but i suspect they are roughly equal at about 0000  0000 sheets laser printers will do 00000000 sheets per toner cartridge  well thats a brief research summary of my personal research  enjoy    hello fellow netters  i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj000 bubblejet vs the hp deskjet 000  i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential  and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson  now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 000 dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlettpackard deskjet 000 000 dpi which is faster  is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics  which will handle large documents better 00 pages or more  any personal experience on either will be appreciated here  which works better under windows 00 any driver problems etc cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc  basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and bad   well i bought the bj 000 about a month ago at the start of their 00 rebate program on that printer it ends 000 and i bought it from computer discount warehouse because their price of 000 couldnt be beat anywhere i looked and i think its a hot printer  just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode  i compared the output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with 0pt type done on my bj 000 with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed how well i could read the small print on the bj 000  printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj 000 which is amazing considering that the hp has 00m ram installed  i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows  i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office and two other engineers placed their orders too  if you need cdws phone number its 0000000000  delivery to ny was two days  good luck   craig witkowski ceng00maccvmcorpmotcom motorola communications  electronics inc glen rock  nj    i own a deskjet 000 performance isnt spectacular under windows using truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen quality for the hp is very much dependent on paper quality  on standard photocopy paper the characters have slightly frayed edges but on better quality distinction type paper things look better for most applications i find copy paper fine  still better than dotmatrix  comes with a windows driver which seems to bypass print manager has a few intellifontswhich are hp scaleable fonts  probably faster than truetype but havent really tried them out can get ram  font cartridges but unless the speed of truetype is a problem i wouldnt bother the ram cartridges cant be used as buffer  soft fonts only  for graphics ie bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via the hp supplied win driver there a number of dither options such as scatter pattern etc  the manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed  text is not so good in this mode problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text  the range of tones for graphic images isnt brilliant but i think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general  from what i have seen the canon is similar in most respects  however a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from epson  this printer is faster cheaper and capable of producing laserlike quality on normal copier paper  cant remember the model  lx  something i think  i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here   the introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand     about a month ago i got a canon bj000  i absolutely love it  it is incredibly fast except for printing from pspice i dont know if you ever do stuff with that or not  most of the stuff i print is either from microsoft word for windows or just plain text  the only problems ive had are printing headersfooters the printer freaked out and printing on cheap paper lots of streaks  normal copy paper works great with it you can only tell its not laserprinted by holding it oh less than twelve inches from your face  that is if youre nearsighted like me   the printer comes with its own driver for windows 00  i have no other complaints  the printer also can act just like some epson or another for those archaic software packages that havent written a driver for it yet the teenyweeny footprint is a real plus tooand if you purchase it between now and may 00 you get a 00 rebate from canon  i bought mine from a store called compusa and the price now is 000  i have a friend who has the hp you are looking at  it also prints very well and everyone has drivers for it but it is very slow  hope i helped  000dpi sure looks great  heather stehman     in message 0000apr000000000000csdnewshoststanfordedu  kaymancsdd0stanfordedu robert kayman writes  hello fellow

data as i used print manager in windows      i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj000 at work and a deskjet 000 at home  i prefer the deskjet  the printing speed and quality are similar i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet for home  the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications  the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm proprinter to get it to work with many nonwindows apps and this will be the case for a long time  the design is superior if you just want to use cut paper the deskjet is quieter and the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs    just my 000 worth    mike mattix agricultural group of monsanto po box 000 luling la 00000 internet address dmmattbigezmonsantocom      yes there is the landscape mode printing problem but it does not present a problem in windows as the windows printer driver handles the translation  i actually thought of some other points after i posted the note  the deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately 0inch around the paper the bubblejet does not  you are right about the graphics resolutions i tested the printers with the applications i had access to wordperfect harvard graphics wingif paintshop pro and paintbrush and could not tell a difference  in fact one of the hp deskjet windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down  the bubblejet did not i had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there  finally i wanted sheet feeding  in that configuration the bubblejet cost approximately 000 more than the deskjet  i went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i spent my own money  btw i am replacing the bj000 with a deskjet 000 at work this month anyway  regards  mike mattix ag group of monsanto luling la    i spent some time comparing the two  we ended up getting the bubblejet bj000 versus the hp  our reasons were  0 the hp seemed to have worse banding than the canon 0 000dpi versus 000  we felt we could see the difference 0 price  canon has a 00 rebate program going on at the moment  the bj000 was our choice over the bj00ex  we could have 000 pages in the bj000 feeder  the bj00ex holds only 00 pages i think  as you can see up to 000 pages on the bj000  we havent done anything big with the bj but its performance seems reasonable under windows  i know that the microsoft bbs has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer but i dont know how it compares also the driver included with the printer is canons whereas i dont know where the microsoft bbs one comes from  microsoft  hope this helps   thomas v frauenhofer wa0yyw tvfccicom uunetuupsicci000tvf tvfcsritedu mandlebratwurst the meal that eats itself    altough im sometimes also a salesperson if im not suppost to study  i would recommend to buy the bj000 the printing quality is a bit better but you youve got much more possiblities dont forget the hp engine is at least 0 years on the marked the canon engine witch is also used in other new bubblejet printers like eg the epson ones is quite recently available   now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 000  dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlettpackard deskjet 000 000 dpi  which is faster  is there a noticeable print quality difference  particularly in graphics  which will handle large documents better 00  ive seen during a short demonstration from someone who tryed to sell me canon printers 0 times the same picture one printed with the bj000 one with the canon the other with the hp and there was a difference in printing quality the canon was a bit better  greetz  kris    when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers  they have near laser quality speed and they are quiet we use both hp deskjets and the canon bj000s  i prefer the paper handling qualities of the deskjets but i feel the canons have superior print quality  the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder however i did end up buying a deskjet for home use got too good a deal  anyway we are using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well  out of 00 deskjets and 0 bj000s i have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by hp  nate    whenever i buy anything i look at what the experts say pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt  ive been unusually flush lately no begging letter please and so ive done this a few times including  about four months ago  with inkjet printers  i cant remember much about the process except that i read about three reviews of inkjets and that the 000 was always at or near the top  i bought the 000c because of the added dimension of colour i intend to build a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that  although i havens used the colour thing in earnest yet i tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the result  i note that even though you can now get the 000c the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge the 000c and 000 are still readily available at least in the uk  the following are my viewsexperience  0i dont know anything about the canon except that i came away from reviews and replies to a posting similar to yours with the idea that the hp offered the best performanceprice ratio  0i believe hp are the originals in the field  not always the ideal place to be but the markets still young so one assumes they have the expertise  0the 000c is worth the extra  operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from windows  0i used to work for monotype when they still manufactured typesetters before their american owners closed them down and i can tell you that in terms of definition 000 dpi is pretty poor anyway so 000 dpi is just a bit less poor  0the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers  0if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack  its pretty slow with it god knows what its like without  i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so its not in daily use  i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start its easy peasy to operate  hope this is of use  regards  david    just bought the bj000  i thought the price couldnt be beat 000 with 00 rebate thru 000 and so far it is comparable even superior to the deskjet in print quality  speed   per page rate seems to be faster i dont have figures          i dont print long docs though  quality i think the graphics quality is excellent  print quality is          excellent as well unless you use small fonts and hold it up          close you can see a lot more jaggies than on a laserjet          the 000 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the          pageprint head in place i would imagine  large docs  not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages           manual says up to 000 though  havent tried it  drivers  no problems under win00 yet  winword doesnt want to print          the envelopes the same way the canon does though  know nothing of addon costs   daniel a hartung    dhartungchinetchinetcom    ask me about rotaract    the deskjet is slow  this is in comparison to the other printers i mentioned  i have no idea how the bubblejet compares  the interface between win00 and the printer is just dandy ive not had any problems with it  i just bought a bj000 printer a couple of days ago  i compared it to the sample print of an hp deskjet 000 and knew that the hp wasnt for me  the bj000 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality  i can compare it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical  depending on the kind of paper  i dont have problems with the ink not being dry it seems to dry very fast  probably within a second  since canon is giving a 00 rebate until the end of may it is really a good buy    sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications    wow its funny you should ask this  im a little behind in news reading so i know this may be late    i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night  i was really worried that i wouldnt like it but the print quality and noise level is fantastic  i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed damn near laser quality  you cant tell its not laser unless you get 0 inches from the page    no problems with drivers  the printer came with the driver diskette which is good because i was beginning to panic when i couldnt findi it under windows or wordperfect  it works well under both  i have yet to install word for windows so dont know how it works with them    i had a deskjet 000 at work last year  it was a good printer as well ut i felt it was awfully slow  and much noisier than the bubblejet  i wont say the bubblejet is much better but i really do like it more  just my 000 worth   brett    sincerely  robert

  i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa counterparts for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iise is only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus which isnt what i would call fast  i dont understand why eisa video cards arent as a group on the same level of performance as local bus cards given that eisa video cards have a 00 bit bus to move data around instead of isas 0 bits  since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board such as a diamond speedstar 00x from pc magazines i think recent report i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card but its around 000 which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend and for 000 i could get a diamond viper and still have 000 left over of course id have to get a local bus mother board too  can anyone shed some light on my confusionfrustration  thanks   christopher wroten cfwworldstdcom

  i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a novell administrators point of view   i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they microsoft has decided to implement as a standard for software support the local setup described below as the most advantageous installation if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then i will comply but id like to hear it from administrators first   the local windows installation  windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive assuming the resources are available  from a network administrators implementation heshe would install all windows disks on a network drive using setupa then install windows on a permachine bases by running setup off the network to install the complete system on the local drives  in this way all drivers are available to the setup procedure wo the need to change disks   advantages  reduce traffic  running windows locally reduces network traffic due to   the local access of main windows files  network independence  if the network fails and they all do at one point   or another the local installation would allow users to keep producing   and reduce the cost of downtime  faster windows  theoretically windows will run faster from a local hard   drive than over a network  this may be a hard point to prove if the network   has an optical backbone andor the network drives are significantly faster   access than local ones  a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about   varying setups monochrome color types of mouse etc since the   windows installation is assigned to the workstation   disadvantages  cost  installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk   space  workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can   increase the cost of the workstation from 00 to 00 percent  administration  local windows installations are very difficult to administer   new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available each of   which would have to be individually installed on each workstation  security  users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system   files from simple ignorance  this could result in quite a headache for   administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations  backup  we all know the problems backing up local hard disks  the backup   sets if done via a centralized tape system get very large very quickly   backup individually to floppy may not happen at all  this may be   eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable   applications and not user data   the shared windows installation  windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setupa procedure described above  users or administrators then install a minimal set of files to individual user directories  these directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network home directory  the bulk of the windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory some 000 files and are accessed shared asneeded by users throughout their windows session  the users files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during hisher windows session  these include group files ini files and other regularly updated files   advantages  a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy  as   an updated driver becomes available it only needs to be installed in this   single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it  assuming that the users files are maintained in network home directories   the administrator can easily edit any ini file asneeded to correct   problems that may arise  this includes winini and systemini  backup of all pertinent files is done easily  even if the users files   are on a local hard disk the bulk of the windows system is backed up with   all driver updates   disadvantages  network traffic  since all windows files are being shared in a network   directory traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the   speed of windows  if the network crashes all production comes to a stop since windows   is reliant upon the network for its files  loss of data usually occurs   as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will   usually not be able to save their work  although minimal disk space is still a consideration  if the users files   are maintained on the network a large number of users can cause a   significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows   files alone  users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation   hardware are similar  this is due to the windows installation being   tied to a particular username in the case of network user files    the discussion  i would like to know from other administrators with a large windows userbase how they prefer setting up windows  personally i have setup numerous installations using the shared setup  all windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks  in fact i sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money   i would also like to see recommendations for applications  should apps such as word andor excel be installed locally regardless of how windows is installed  again i keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is putting all eggs in one basket if the network crashes work comes to a halt   now i am sure microsoft and i know your out there has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to hear from people with actual working experience with users and network administration

  i dont know much about computers so please bear with me heres my question  context i use a package called slip on my home computer to connect to the          university mainframe an ibm 0000 running vmsmvs and log on to my          account when i installed slip on my computer i had to configure it          for my modem 000 kbs etronics internal and had to supply the phone          number to dial to reach the mainframe the way it works now is that          i type telnet uicvm or tn0000 uicvm either will work at the dos          prompt uicvm is the node name of the mainframe the program then          dials the mainframe establishes a protocol and gives me the logon          screen telnet and tn0000 are the names of batch files in my slip          directory i have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the          session  problem i would like to be able to do all this under windows 00 because i          hardly ever use dos directly slip will not run under windows i          talked to the people at our computer center and they suggested that          i use a packet driver called winpktcom with slip they gave me          instructions on how to load it before i start windows and how to          modify the tcpstart and tcpstop batch files in the slip directory          to ensure that it would work i did all that and i could run slip          from windows but there were other problems for one thing slip          would not hang up the phone when i exited i had to run my communi          cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when          that didnt work for another there were too many errors it often          took me 00 tries to connect to the mainframe our computer center          does not support slip under windows so i cant keep going back to          them with more questions  question is there some other shareware package that will run under windows          and do what slip is supposed to do i need a package that is not too          expensive which is why i am looking for shareware i have heard that          there are regular commercial packages that do all this but they cost          hundreds of dollars these are the main requirements           0 must be able to run under windows 00          0 must allow vt000 and ibm tn0000 terminal emulation          0 must allow ftp file transfers since thats the only kind the             mainframe allows no ymodem or zmodem etc i believe the ftp             transfers are made through a kermit protocol but im hazy about             that           a subsidiary feature that would be nice to have if its a true          windows program rather than a dos program modified to run under          windows is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently          with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet          session and other applications  any information received is appreciated  pankaj saxena u00000uicvmuicedu

  has anyone observed this  if i copy a large say 000k file a large pkzip file for instance to my floppy drive 00 under ms windows 00 via either program manager or a dos shell the file copied under the dos shell  has errors whereas the file copied from within program manager does not  the corruption is detected by executing pkunzip t bfilezip after  both copies  the file copied via the dos shell always shows corruption   now heres the kicker   i have many windows open while doing this both dos and windows apps supposedly all windows apps share the same time slice whereas the  dos apps get their own equal time slice unless overriden   so as an example i have 0 windows apps open 0 multitasking dos sessions running and one executionexeclusive dos shell iconized inactive  under this  scenario cpu time is divided into two major slices  one for all the windows apps and one slice for the running dos app    when copying under windows pgm mgr ill assume the other windows and dos tasks are essentially inactive  thus pgm mgr gets say 00 of the windows slice and 00 of the executionbackground dos shells slices  thus it gets 0000   00 or 00 of the total available cpu time   when copying in a dos shell i activate the executeexclusive mode dos shell no other dos background tasks allowed full screen under the windows task manager  the cpu time available to this shell would be 00 of the windows slice assumming inactive windows applications and 000 of the dos slice  000  0 or 00 of the total available cpu time  so why do i get copy errors under dos if it has the greater amount of cpu time  is program manager working in a preemptive mode during the floppy  copy  it must be    miscellaneous data  running windows on top of dos 00 qemm 0x rapidbiossys                      00 mbyte smartdrive no delayed writes two ramdrives                       logitech mouse driver 00 full 00mbytes motherboard ram                      00kbyte motherboard cache 000 dx 00 mhz                                            running doseditcom tsr in the dos shell                          wayne long  oe000              internet wclriscspsmotcom 0000 william cannon drive west  uucp cstexaseduoakhillriscwcl austin texas 000000000        phone 000 0000000  fax 0000000

  from article c00ubgk0wworldstdcom by cfwworldstdcom christopher f wroten  i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most  eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa  counterparts for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iise is  only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus which isnt  what i would call fast    i dont understand why eisa video cards arent as a group on the  same level of performance as local bus cards given that eisa video  cards have a 00 bit bus to move data around instead of isas 0 bits   good question answer the eisa bus does move 00 bits rather than isas 000         but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus         i think thats either 0 or 00 mhz         the local bus designs also move 00 bits like the eisa but         they move the data at the cpu speed up to 00 mhz         so on a 00mhz cpu the local bus is moving 00bit data at         00 mhz and the eisa is moving 00bit data at 0 or 00 mhz         so the local bus should be 0 to 0 times faster than eisa on         a 00 mhz cpu  eisa should be about two maybe 0 times as         fast as isa   since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher  cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than  and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board such as a  diamond speedstar 00x from pc magazines i think recent report  i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card but its  around 000 which is just about double what my wallet will allow  me to spend and for 000 i could get a diamond viper and still  have 000 left over of course id have to get a local bus mother  board too   thats a very good question  the eisa bus does have more advantages over the isa bus than just its width  for example morebetter  interrupts and bus mastering  but these other factors do not impact  a video card very much  they have more impact on file servers with  multiple hard drives fullthrottle network cards cdroms etc   can anyone shed some light on my confusionfrustration    thanks   christopher wroten cfwworldstdcom      
  says  does anybody here know whether windows nt doeswill include a x windows server     could you add some information to no it does not say for instance your source of information  source for does not comment the cdrom and manuals for the march beta  there is no x windows server there  will there be  of course  even if microsoft supplies one with nt other vendors will no doubt port theirs to nt  according to a recent newsletter from hummingbird communications ltd they announced exceedent at uniforum 00  the announcement reads like it is here now but there is no order or price info  i would guess it must be rsn  there is a dev kit too  
  regarding the horror stories about dos0doubledisk and stacker 0 killing hard drives  i was wondering if the dos 0 mirror command works on the doubled drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table if it records the vital doubledisk info then using it daily should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the type of catastrophic failure discussed  if it doesnt then shame on microsoft

  on my pc i almost exclusively run windows the only dos based application   i have is procommplus  in my configsys i have emm000 loaded with the   option noems no expanded memory following a thread in one of the comp   newsgroups i read that it was no necessary to have emm000 loaded indeed   in the manual it says that emm000 is used to get expanded memory out of   extended memory since i have the noems option it seems to me that the   emm000 device is useless in my case   should i use emm000 or should i remove it from my configsys  thanks for your help  eric  emm000 noems enables the system to use the upper memory between 000 and  0000  thats a good place for device drivers dos kernal etc keep it in

     i friend of mine installed dos0 at work and is hooked up to a novell  network running netware 000 v000  the problem hes having is that the  doublespace program is using drive h as the swap drive which is  confliting with the networks mapped drives    is there switch to place the swap drive to someother drive  please emailthanks a bunch     mahbub  cu000clevelandfreenetedu  determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your configsys  if you are using w0ww you might want to go a couple of drives higher to give you some shared drive space  reboot and novell will set its first drive one above the lastdrive in configsys  you might have to remap some of your novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives  make sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto novell is set to the correct drive one above the lastdrive setting in the configsys file

  ardie mack writes  on my pc i almost exclusively run windows the only dos based   application    i have is procommplus  in my configsys i have emm000 loaded with the    option noems no expanded memory following a thread in one of the   comp    newsgroups i read that it was no necessary to have emm000 loaded   indeed    in the manual it says that emm000 is used to get expanded memory out   of    extended memory since i have the noems option it seems to me that the    emm000 device is useless in my case     should i use emm000 or should i remove it from my configsys    thanks for your help    eric    emm000 noems enables the system to use the upper memory between 000   and   0000  thats a good place for device drivers dos kernal etc  keep it in  well i thought that highmemsys would do that too i just took out emm000   of my configsys and im still loading my other drivers high mouse vga   shadow bios doskey etc i havent checked memc but i believe i have   managed to load them high ie between 000kb and 0000kb  also ever since i took out emm000 windows loads slightly faster i get   about 0 extra meg of freemem in windows im running 000 enhanced with 0   meg ram 0 meg swap and i got rid of my ctrlalt del reboot problem   before the computer would not reboot using ctrlaltdel after exiting   windows   i would really like to keep emm000 out of my configsys anybody else have   info on this  eric  
   one of our users is having an unusual problem  if she does an alttab to a fullscreen dos program when she goes back to windows her desktop fonts have changed  if she goes back to a fullscreen dos program and then goes back to windows the font has changed back to its default font  its not a major problem everything works and the font is legible but it is annoying  does anyone have any idea why this happens  by the way she has a dec 000d0lp machine   if its any consolation i had a similar problem as i recall if i exited from a dos session while in fullscreen mode the menu titles had changed to a scrambled version of the icon title font or something like that it only started happening after i used icontitlefacename in winini to change the desktop font to arial so i stopped exiting from dos sessions while in fullscreen mode  my mac used to do something similar arent computers weird     mark hadfield                       hadfieldwaogretacrinz    niwa oceanographic taihoro nukurangi                           000 evans bay rd greta point      telephone 000 0000000   po box 00000 kilbirnie           fax       000 0000000   wellington new zealand                                              
  kenton shaver ks0landrewcmuedu writes lets see what ms products dont have major bugs in them  oh but the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up even if their  generally the second or third major release usually takes care of it my advice based on plenty of personal experience is to never buy the first version of anything from microsoft  this includes major version number upgrades from previous releases such as microsoft c 000 always wait at least for the a upgrade or slipstream upgrade if youre going to buy it   san francisco is like granola take away the fruits and the nuts and all you have left are the flakes

  there has been a long running discussion over changing the startup logo for windows for a few weeks here while all the copy methods are great  havent seen any mention of a program that will do it for you   well i found one on cica called winlogo cant remember where unfortuantely and it seems to work real well even comes with a couple example rle files   what id really like though is a way to create rle files myself specifically the rle0 format mentioned in the winlogo readme file can anyone point me in the direction of such a beast with a real directory path  all the ones ive seen mentioned didnt pan out   email   unx oddjobozplymouthedu vms andyspscplymouthedu  disclaimer  any enduser software that provides no avenue for user  of the week modification or programmability is not user friendly      
  heres the situation  at home i have ms word for windows but no printer  at work i have windows  a postscript printer but not ms word  so i configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer and use the print to file option which produces a nice postscript file which i then bring to work  my question  how do i print this postscript file through the print manager at work if for example i select print from the file manager it treats the postscript as a text file and gives me several pages of postscript gibberish  i know that i can open a dos window and do   copy fileps com0  which does work but seems not to multitask very well  other applications run rather slowly and often pause for 00s of seconds  there ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the print manager but if there is i cant find any mention of it in the documentation  anyone know how to do this    michael clase memorial university of newfoundland mclaseriemannmathmunca

  suppose you want to change the particular icon for a program in windows such as the msdos one  would someone let me know how you can do this    it depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that comes standard with windows or with an icon from some other icon manager  well if it is one of those that comes with windows just highlight the  item by clicking once on it click on file and then on properties you should see a box which says change icon click on it you are going to be presented with some icons sometimes just one if you dont like any of those presented click on the browse box and look for the file moriconsdll select it browse through the icons presented and just double click on your desired icon  if you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager say iconpower for instance open the icon manager at the bottom of your screen where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace when you have found your desired icon click on it once and while holding the mouse button down pull this icon over the one you wish to change and thats it  regards    kan mongwa             mongwaacsubuffaloedu                          state univeristy         bitnet   v000wxkpubvms     humpty dumpty     of new york  buffalo               c000wxkpubvm

   has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so what have you done to cure it  one workstation in a wfw network goes deaf to any form of communication from other workstations until it goes out on the network itself from then on other workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf  again   the workstation is set up to share its discs etc the machine is a 000dx00 0mb ram with diamond stealth video  it behaves this way with a variety of 00 bit network adapters including a smc elite it also behaves the same way if i use the windows vga driver rather than the diamond drivers

overview      the dib image file format is intended to be a device independent  bitmap     file  format  what microsoft means by device independent is unclear to     me four pixel resolutions are supported 0 bit 0 bit 0 bit and 00 bit     pixels      these images were intended for use on dos ibm or littleendian systems     ifyou  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte     swap all short and long integer values      by convention dib images end in the extension bmp   this  is  because          march 00 0000           0        they  are  a  superset of earlier bitmap image files  consequently you     will sometimes hear dib files referred to as bmp files      since dib images files are a superset there are three flavors  of  dib     images  o   dos dib images  these are the recommended convention  and  the      form  which i will describe how to create they are intended for      applications running under ms windows 00 in a dos environment  o   os0 dib images  my understanding is that these are  theflavor      of dib images that were used by the presentation manager  o   oldstyle bitmap images                                               march 00 0000           0        differences between flavors      the dos dib images consist of  0  a bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file as  a      dib  file  thisheaderalso gives the total size of the image      file and the offset to the image data  0  a bitmapinfoheader  image  header  which specifies  the image      attributes  0  an optional palette of colors used by the image  if  it  exists      this  may contain 0 00 or 000 entries  each entry is a windows      rgbquad structure  0  the image data itself       the os0 dib images consist of  0  the same bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file      as a  dib file this  header also gives the total size of the      image file and the offset to the image data  0  a bitmapcoreheader  image  header  which specifies  the image      attributes  0  an optional palette of colors used by the image  again if  this      exists  it may  contain  0 00 or 000 entries  each entry is a      windows rgbtriple structure  0  the image data itself       the old style image bitmap consists of  0  either a bitmapinfoheader or a  bitmapcoreheader whichheader      type is determined by the first long integer

theheader      was a bitmapcoreheader  0  the image data itself       creating dib image files      creating a dos dib image file consists of several straight forwardsteps     the headers need to be

out is padded to  the  next  four     byte  quantity   so  if  you had an 0bit image which was only one pixel     wide you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line   the     number of

   a friend of mine uses windows 00 to do most of her work unfortunately she has very bad eyesight and we havent been able to figure out how to change the default font used by the system and application menus or the font used by the help program what use is hypertext if you cant read it to make it legible to her  if anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts of any software package that makes windows more accessible to visually handicapped people please let me know  thanks dan

  ive started getting a message from windows 00 whenever i try to execute a dos program from windows either thru the program manager or the file manager a message box comes up and says this program or one of its components is compressed use the msdos expand command to expand the file  now i know this is bogus because i can always execute the program from dos when not running windows the program in question is commandcom yup the basic dos command line shell and the expand command tells me that the file is already expanded  all my windows apps work just fine  i only get this message when trying to execute a dos program from windows  clues anyone  thanks   christopher wroten cfwworldstdcom   
   im writing a mail management system using word for windows 00 as a front end the user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch of mail as footxt  ive set up an autoexec macro in winword to load footxt ok but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course pose file name contention problems  what id really like to do is to create an autoexit macro in winword that would move footxt to a specified directory rename it using the current date and time and delete the original footxt   in other words footxt gets renamed as 0000000 say on may 0 at 0000 the user gets a timeindexed backup of his mail files and footxt is freed up for the next packet of mail since my autoexec macro points to it  my main question is this   how may one rename a file from within a wordbasic macro to include a  timedate variable in the new filename    thanks     if you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking a beer    i bet it makes beer shoot out of your nose  jack handey     erich w lantz  ewlworldstdcom  timberville va  dod 0000

    well ive come into some money and want to buy cdrom sound board and speakers  i have not kept up on any material relating to sound boards and cdroms because until now i never thought id have enough money      so can you gurus out there point me in the direction of a good package including cdrom sound and speakers and software i suppose or since i dont really need the cdrom right now give me some good ideas for sound boards and speakers  those i could really use now  i have looked at soundblaster pro which costs about as much as i think i want to spend on a board 000 and ive looked at the gravis sound board which is about 000 and i dont know the advdisadv of either of these boards      right now i want to use it with any games that support sound and to use in windows 00 to utilize sound capabilities there  so any concise info on sound boards complete multimedia packages etc would be greatly appreciated  if anyone else is interested in this info i would be glad to summarize responses and post      and if this is some type of faq please point me in the right direction and dont bother taking up a lot of bandwidth  thanks   brett   brett watson databasesystem administrator kansas supreme court  topeka ks

  everyone seems to think that this mans mouse problem is mechanical its dirty  i have been having a similar problem with my mouse and it only occurs when ru nning windows and therefore cannot be mechanical in nature   its my understanding that bus mice are more accurate and stable in general than serial mice  if i remember correctly its because of the differences in how the interrupts are handled as well as the fact that the mouse data is received over the computer bus as opposed to a 0000 bps serial connection  im running a mouse  systems compatible mouse on a 000 00 dx0 with a trident 0 meg video card and a m experienceing similar jumpiness as well as strange font subsitutions and mous e traces left on screen and windows gpf errors help  is this just a general problem or is it associated with a specific application or group of applications

  im looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs  a couple of issues ago pc mag listed as editors choices both conversion artist and hijaak for windows  anyone have any experience with those or some others  im trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days and im not making much progress with the screen shots     im currently using dodot and im about to burn it and the disks it rode it on  its got a lot of freaky bugs and oversights that are driving me crazy  tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a tiff file thats under a certain arbitrary size it will swap the left and right sides of the picture   usually it confines itself to not copying things to the clipboard so i have to save and load pix for editing in paintbrush or crashing every hour or so   the one nice thing it has though is its dither option  youd think that this would turn colors into dots which it does if you go from say 000 colors to 00 colors  but if you go from 000 or 00 colors to bw you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which turn to white  for me this is useful because i can turn light grays on buttons to white and the dark grays to black and thereby preserve the 0deffect on buttons and other parts of the window   if you understood my description  can you tell me if another less buggy program can do this as well   much thanks for any help  signature david delgreco                        what lies behind us and what lies technically a writer                  before us are tiny matters compared delgrecorahulnet                    to what lies within us                                                oliver wendell holmes   david f delgreco delgrecorahulnet

   and i would hardly call a command that can delete a tree and a move  command as a state of the art wizbang feature  they are damn necessary  i have often cursed not being able to have some kind of recursive delete  you are missing something  with the windows file manager you can  ms  but i dont want to have to run blasted windows every time i want to delete a tree  it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete some files  it would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a car   wants people to buy windows not dos  ms knows dos wont last forever  only because its crap which is noones fault but their own   they want you to move to windows 00 then later to win00 and eventually to  cairo  this way they give you a reason to  by deliberately crippling the product  surely no  oh hold on i guess youre right  that certainly stinks of microsoft marketing techniques  but the point still remains that a command to delete trees is not new technology and is the kind of thing one would have expected to see long before windows was even dreamt of         want good file handling  use filemanexe  this product requires  microsoft windows        dos is dead  well amen to that but i wish it were a damn sight deader  for a dead product its used an awful lot  and i suspect its going to carry on twitching for a long while yet which isnt doing anyone any good  and microsoft dont appear to have given up marketing dos so it is a very unusual form of death indeed    tim walls  sysop  protocol bbs   datafax 000000 000000        fidonet 0000000    amiganet 000000                         twallsncc0000ddemoncouk                          pgp 00 public key available

  seen from a typographically point of view atm using postscript fonts is better than truetype the hinting mechanism incorporated in ps is gorgeous multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in a ps font as problematically they may have better use of the unicode features of tt fonts in windows nt  ive seen lots of really beautiful and printableinsmallsize ps fonts i havent seen those as tt fonts most of them are rendering quite inaccurate in small sizes esp as screen fonts simply compare timesnewroman as a ps font with the tt font the first looks better  i am hoping that there will be atmnt     claudius mokler email moklerdesertinberlinde

anonymous ftp from  mishnaesyscwruedu internet no 000000000 a sample ftp session  is given at the end of this file     changes in version 00 update from v000 to v00  in this version we have revised cosypak to take advantage of  the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v00   since mathematica 00 provides a better  and  working  laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than  mathematica v00 did we adopted them this has made cosypak  smaller thus brian evans signal processing packages that supported  the laplacetransform  and inverselaplacetransform functions in the  cosypak v000 are no longer needed directly by cosypak v00 for  power users who  use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very   fine  brian evans package on signal processing available at  the anonymous  ftp site gausseedspgatechedu  or  ip  00000000000  on   the  downside the disadvantage of this update  can be that mathematica 00 requires more runtime resources than its  previous version      for mathematica 00 users  we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica 00 in   the directory for00 please move all files and directory under for00 into   the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory          introduction         this is an unsupported release of cosypak  a control systems  analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using  mathematica 00 classical control systems analysis and design methods and some   modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package           this package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a  next tm computer a unix based workstation they have been  used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control  engineering texts ogata 0000 phillips and harbor 0000 for  undergraduate courses in control engineering i taught at the systems  engineering department of cwru in addition to the next they have  also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers tm and  ibm pcs tm running ms windowstm we would be very much interested  to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on  platforms not mentioned above ibm users however will have to  evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics      once installed see below for instructions this  collection  of   mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user bundled with the  packages are many notebooks cosynotes which demonstrate   the functionality of these packages the notebooks follow a plan of  many

  even so my point still stands to an extent  that 00k limits appear all over the place where they really are not necessary such as the edit control limit  while the 00k limit may not be necessary limitation they probably fall within the category of reasonable limitations  if you find yourself trying to allocate an edit control for more than 00k of text its probably time take a good look at your programs design  why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory handles allowed  in what way is 0000 a small number  it seems to me that youd hit the wall in many other ways before youd hit the systemwide limit on global handles unless of course youre abusing globalalloc   and please dont try to tell me that its impossible to abuse the resources available under other operating systems  all systems have limits  the question is whether or not the limits are reasonable  so far you havent offered a single argument which suggests that windows limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems     rick schaut uucpuunet  uwbeavermicrosoftrichs  microsoft doesnt speak for me and i dont speak for microsoft

  hello  i want a little network for 0 users all users want to run windows the most important things i want for the network are filesharing mail utility two printers on one of the computers and a faxmodem card on one of the computers we all want to use each others harddisk  my idea was to buy three computers one 000dx and two 000dx all three have a 00mb local harddisk the 000 also has a very large harddisk all three also have a network card the 000 is connected to the printers and contains the faxmodem card and last but not least workgroups for windows  my questions  is this possible  what exactly are the possibilities and advantages of workgroups   for windows  will all the computers be fast enough behind all three someone   is working  thanks martijn

  ignore the attacks and look at the sales numbers and the ms stock price if you need some  gratification just keep doing the great job you have done in the past thx dave l  this is the part that usually gets me while i am set to make money there usually are other things to be considered and debated that is the purpose of life if you only willing to look at the stock price and sales numbers for gratification usually youll end up with japanese or whoever that is competitive owing your business  ie shortsighted imo this is very irresponsible narrow minded and selfish henceforth ignoring the attack is not the right approach as a matter of fact i just happen to believe the willingness to debate and readjust is the greatest assets of this society sales number and stock price is the shortterm result not the cause

    how does print manager deal with multiple printers     were planning   to print to two printers from an application  one will be a real printer and the other a   fax program     will print manager just deal with the jobs one at a time or will it feed to both printers at once   please research carefully  just because a fax modem behaves like a printer on a local machine doesnt guarantee functionality  when a local machine has fax software printing to a remotely installed fax card  i tried this with workgroups and the  fax software didnt like it at all  could have been winfaxs peculiarisms but i dont think so  a lot of special hardware interaction takes place internally  in my case a fax manager program merely intercepts the print job and spools it to its own directory not print managers spool directory  to software it appears the job was printed  print manager  plays no part in the handling of the actual process  pardon me if ive incorrectly assumed this is what you were up to  a truely networkaware faxmodem will most likely be required or a lot of weird setup and tinkering  good luck

       i am setting up my dosunix box on a 000m ide and a 000m scsi drive  and was wondering about the use of the msdos 00 join command  i  like the way it sets things up since i wont have to stick with the c  d  e crap that dos enforces  i like how it would mimic mount  points of unix filesystems  i have heard that there were problems  with using it or at least under older versions of dos  please tell  i have been using the join command for many years now mostly with good success in duplicating unixstyle file mounts  you will hear lots of people cursing join because they confuse it with the dos append command a truely gnarly hack but dont believe them  you also will hear people saying that microsoft recommends that you not use join  but in microsofts windows 0 workgroups resource toolkit the following appears    join an msdos utility works fine with windows for workgroups 00 if   you do not change the state of the joined drives during a windows for   workgroups 00 session this includes adding or removing joined drives   from within windows for workgroups we recommend that you do not use   join when running windows setup or windows for workgroups 00  within this caveat join appears to be valid under windows  however i have found a couple of applications that dont deal well with filesystems that have been mounted using join  in particular the worst offender is word for windows 00x  it gets very confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive it wants to create the saved file as nnnnntmp in the current dir then delete the old file and rename the nnnnntmp file to the doc file  unfortunately wfw usually writes the nnnnntmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory often in the root dir of the joined filesystem but not always  then after deleting the original doc file it cant find the nnnnntmp file to rename it  unless you search your disk systems the document is gone  i have also found subtle problems using the mks toolkit from a dos box when joined filesystems are present  i used to join ctemp with a 0meg ramdisk but mks sometimes gets confused when doing an ls on the ctemp dir and misses some files in the temp dir  this is difficult to  reproduce but it goes away totally when join is not used  i think this is a windows problem rather than mkss since it works ok under raw dos  so i would suggest that you can use join but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like  wouldnt it be real great to mount network drives ie z under the main file tree rather than having all those darned drive letters unfortunately join wont let you do it  there was talk on the net about a simple patch to let join work on network drives but i dont remember the source  its too bad the join command is not better implemented since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters  i realize that messdos was meant for casual even ignorant users so mounting all the drives in one file tree might be confusing but it looks like ms is going to carry this over into windows nt another os meant for casual even igorant  users  not  with all its old family system baggage maybe ms needs a recovery group so they can get on with life    jerome jerry schneider             domain jlsatgcom  aspen technology group               uucp   uunetcsnatglabjls po box 000 ft collins co 00000    voice  000 0000000

   lots of stuff deleted because i felt like it   this ms bashing has definitely lost all its humor value  i think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users of ms products do not even know about internet and unix is that very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather comfortable abreviations they know and the abreviations have subtle differences between the different vendors while pc users tend to customize any windowing setup they can not do much with their  command line  so to most of the computer users in the world ms product symbolize quality ms has made their life easier and more productive and to them that is quality they do not care about what innovative things ms has done other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot easier you may know better than most computer users in this world but that will not change their perception  face it until unix come up with a decent gui that is available to all variations of unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream of computer users we here on the net are not mainstream computer users   brian    disclaimer the opinions expressed are mine not those of bnr     brian ws0s sttt userdeveloper   if i wanted a computer to play games   bell northern research               on id buy an amiga however i have    research triangle park nc           real work to do so please get lost

     after hearing endless debate read namecalling over which os is better dos    and windows or os0 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple    of different operating systems i have decided to put the two products to a    head to head test as so many fellow newsposters have suggested  i have     however no desire whatsoever to use a version of os0 which wont really    do what it says ie run windows apps  os0 0000 will not run windows    apps in 000 enhansed mode something that most larger windows apps require but    os0 00 which is supposed to be in beta test is supposed to  i have heard    that os0 00 beta is available via ftp and i was wondering if anyone knew    where to obtain a copy  i would appreciate any information as i would like     once and for all to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs     robbie    zshererrgsfasuedu  if you wait until may the 00th you will be able to buy the new os0 00 since it will be released at comdex that day it will run windows 00 apps and windows enh mode if you cant wait then you can ftp a 0 months old beta version from ftpos0nmsuedu but this version is probably a lot slower than the final product  when you do your test please have in mind that a single tasking system will always be faster at doing one task the real power of os0 lies in the multitasking and cant really be measured by a stopwatch  happy benchmarking hans    the whales of the atlantic and the people of the faroe islands  have coexisted in perfect harmony for the last 0000 years  no matter what any urban navel contamplator without any real relation to the coherence of the nature says   
     i dont think the question is    will os0 xx run windows yy apps now     a more important question is    will subsequent os0 versions continue to run apps    from subsequent windows versions in the future         john a grantjagrantemr0emrca    airborne geophysics    geological survey of canada ottawa   but the most important question is will there be any os0 apps so we dont  have to load windows in the future  and maybe the question of the future will be will windows x0 run os0 yy apps now  regards hans    the whales of the atlantic and the people of the faroe islands  have coexisted in perfect harmony for the last 0000 years  no matter what any urban navel contamplator without any real relation to the coherence of the nature says   
  i really think you are comparing apples and oranges nobody disputes that os0 has more big os features the question is does an  individual need the power the sales of windows vs os0 answer that question the next question is even if i did want to run os0 and i had this big monster machine to run it on is there a diverse set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my work go to your local computer store to answer this one i think the comparison you need to be doing is nt vs os000 this is where the new battle lines will be drawn windows 00 has won the single user pc war the next one will be the client server war and the entries are nt os000 unix and netware 00 granted these oss will be eventually scaled down to be attractive to the single user pc and that will probably be phase ii of the war who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure  is fun watching and arguing about it tho thx dave l       
  does anyone know how to absolute memory locations in windows ie  hardware that is memory mapped at very high addresses 00mb and above please reply by email thanks david  
  hello phjm you wrote   firstly does windows 00 in 000 enhanced mode do anything special  with dlls that have been compiled using the large memory model  no   we are being told that even in 000 enhanced mode windows  will load dlls into real memory below 000k and pagelock it  no   my second question relates to static data inside dlls is there  any way at all to get multiple instances of the static data  segment dgroup  no but  you can allocate real static data within code segments when you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap  you can forget most of what was written about memory management under 00 you have paged virtual memory you can lock every block without hampering the memory manager you can use far pointer everytime without always lock unlocking the memory block  an besides dlls are mostly just disguised exes that happen to be called by another task   karl   karlwgeitz hauptstr00 w0000 salzgitter 0 kwgeitzslinkescapede tel 0000000000 fax 0000000000 cis 000000000 bix geitzkwg  crosspoint v00

  i think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users of ms products do not even know about internet and unix is that very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather comfortable abreviations they know and the abreviations have subtle differences between the different vendors while pc users tend to customize any windowing setup they can not do much with their  command line  you cant customize a command line interface  where have you been  i can change the prompt i can make aliases so someone like me who is used to say ls can type it on my dos machine and still get a directory listing and under unix if i dont like the command line interface i throw it out and get a different one csh bash ksh sh etc  so to most of the computer users in the world ms product symbolize quality ms has made their life easier and more productive and to them that is quality they do not care about what innovative things ms has done other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot easier you may know better than most computer users in this world but that will not change their perception  this is true  face it until unix come up with a decent gui that is available to all variations of unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream of computer users we here on the net are not mainstream computer users  a decent gui for all variations of unix lessee what about motif or the stuff from mit twm comes to mind those are pretty standard heck an xwindows program runs like it likes to  all the end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows with the mouse and since it is a gui its graphical and a bit easier to figure out something the windows people have been pressing down our throats for some time now  the thing i fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users running windows all flavors and the other power users running unix and other more advanced oses at least right now dos is still pretty much king i can bring a copy of my latest whizbang programming demo over to my friends house and since we both run dos he can enjoy it too  agriergompersgompersedu or tfinncrashctscom preferred

  i have been backing up my hard drive ever since i had to reinstall everything from scratch after a crash learned the hard way didnt i i am using a windowsbased backup program actually norton and i  began wondering about the logic of this  sure if i accidentally delete a file i can get it from the archive  but what if my disk crashes again i would not be able to start windows to run the backup program  note by crash i mean there was some error message that prevented the machine from booting properly  i think i gave up too early but i didnt have the timepatiencetools to figure out exactly what the problem was  my hard drive needed cleaning up anyway yeah right  this whole scenario is complicated by the fact that i am using stacker  so i think there are 0 possibilities     0 im right  if my disk really crashes i would at least have to       reinstall dos and windows to get the backup program working    0 im wrong  there is an easy way to make a mirror of a hard disk       that can easily restore its state from scratch  the polls are open  tom ioerger univeristy of illinois cs grad student ioergercsuiucedu

  in the newer versions of norton backup for windows 00 at least there is an emergency disk which will allow you to restore from tape without reinstalling doswindows i understand its sort of cumbersome to use but not nearly as much as reinstalling everything      steven a mccluney              better to remain silent and be       sam0000chensun0mtamuedu      thought a fool than to speak and                                     remove all doubts                 i can hardly speak for myself

  youre right  you cannot read or write a mac or apple ii 000k 00 disk or apple ii 000 disk without extra hardware however mac 000mb disks can be read and written in a pc 00 hd drive with software only   this should probably be added to every pc and mac faq file it sure gets asked enough  i agree that this should be added to some sort of faq list  but we have strayed from the original topic  our computer environment is pretty split between macs and pcs i am lucky and get to have both on my desk  but there are people who have pcs and need to share data with the mac users here  the mac users have no problems because of package called dos mounter which automatically lets the mac read dos disks natively  for the pc there is no equivilant that i know of  both macette and macsee have been  inconsistant under the dos platform and requires you to perform the activity in a dos program to selectively transport the files  the question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into windows like a dll that will interpret the reading of a mac disk when it is  in a pc and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs  it is quite clear that this would only be available for the 000mb flopies    tj fiske  tfiskequalcommcom  
   my windows 00 installation has somehow gone awry  whenever i try to run windows now the logo comes up ok but when it tries to enter windows itself the screen gets totally screwed up as if its in the wrong graphics mode or something  its completely illegible although functional as i can still exit to dos with an alte return combination  i tried to reinstall windows again but if you recall halfway through the installation process install takes you into windows and there my graphics problem surfaces again so i cannot complete the reinstallation  all this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my configsys and autoexecbat have been restored to what they were before this problem cropped up  im running a 00000dx with a diamond stealth vram ive resinstalled the stealth video drivers again but with no luck  im also using qemm and stacker 00 but windows is installed on an unstacked partition  and of course it worked perfectly before  any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated  thanks  hutch   
  so i think there are 0 possibilities     0 im right  if my disk really crashes i would at least have to       reinstall dos and windows to get the backup program working  using the software youre using i agree with you there  what i did i installed dos windows and cpbackup functionally the same as your norton for the purposes of this discussion and used the  dos backup command on just that much  to restore i boot to the  system diskette and use dos restore to read in that much then boot to windows and restore my full backups using cpb norton in your case overwriting what ive just restored  that allows me to keep this skeletal windows essentially unchanged with all my customization on the real copy done using the 0rdparty backup utility     0 im wrong  there is an easy way to make a mirror of a hard disk       that can easily restore its state from scratch  seems possible if you can put skeletal versions of dos and your backup utility on a system floppy  then you could restore it all on one go     martin lodahlsystems analyst capacity planning pacificbell   malodahpacbellcom      sacramento ca usa            0000000000      if its good for ancient druids runnin nekkid through the wuids      drinkin strange fermented fluids its good enough for me  unk

  i have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week if you do get multiple copies my apologies  here is a challenge to microsoft or microsort supporters to defend the pathetic state of dos 0 as an upgrade distribution  it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of upgrading to dos 0 that i have been

things   disk performance with double space and smart drive   while most things did not appear to slow down most of the time certain applications appeared to run very much slower  what was interesting is that commands like chkdsk and defrag were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards  i suspected double space ds and decided to measure its impact on my system using winbenchtm  the real disk winmark of 00000 for the original system as shipped from factory with dos 0 and windowws 00 became 00000 when upgraded to dos 0 with ds  thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than 00 percent which did not really surprise me because i knew that ds compression must cost something  specifically for short sequential reads up to 000 bytes ds actually improves transfer rates by about 00 because cpu being faster than io more cpu cycles needed for ds is more than compensated by savings in io cycles  however for all other cases particularly large random writes the transfers take up to three times as long  while the performance depends on the type of access ie random or sequential small or large transfer units on the average based on winbenchs assumptions the disk slows down to half its speed  the tests alone done in real mode see winbench and with smartdrv on do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like there is no noticable difference in performance or even that it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and slow disk io  this explained why some applications ran markedly slower but not why chkdsk and defrag the latter especially too so long   double space and windows   dblspace will not run at all from within windows not even if you wanted to only to get information not modify anything or for that matter even check on its usage  try fasthelp dblspace in a dos box within windows and you will see what i mean from the error message you get  how narrow minded can a programer get i wonder  yes this information can be obtained through the mstoolsdd addon to file manager but this mstools dll does not understand a compressed floppy  use the dos 0 supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to   dos 0 defragmenter is incompatible with ti apm   defragmentation seemed to take too much time  even so i waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm this confirmation dblspace def command for the 000m drive should take no more than 00 seconds much faster on other defragmenters i have used but it took 00 minutes  i discovered that if i moved the mouse defragmentation checking ran faster the  figure ticked more rapidly  it dawned on me that this had to do with tis battery saver advanced power management apm module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the cpu is idle and it obviously thought ds defragmentation was an idle process  after disabling the tis power saver this operation took only 00 seconds   microsft programmers think ti0000 and gateway nomad users are idiots   in the readmetxt file you can find the the following  running microsoft backup with ti0000 and gateway nomad computers  to avoid a conflict between the turbo feature and microsoft backup for windows or msdos add a l0 switch to the device command in your configsys that loads the batterypro file or before you run microsoft backup type setpower l0 at the command prompt  if you checked tis manual on the l0 option you will realise that it means disable all power saving features of your notebook  why would anyone want to run a driver disabled  as i have found out not only does tis power management interfere with microsoft backup as the readmetxt claims but chkdsk and dblspace and who knows what else are crippled by the tis power saver  it is obvious that there is not such thing as apm specifications  if there indeed is such a thing then either microsoft programmers or ti programmers dont know how to read these specifications  you dont have to guess as to who are the idiots  by the way if you run the advance power management utility powerexe in dos0 when you check the status it says  power management status  setting   adv max cpu idle 00 of time  this figure of 00 seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when i am running nothing windows with only program manager in iconised form  does that mean that windows takes up 00 of my cpu all for itself and that i have at best only 00 left for useful work  is such an overhead justified  whether or not windows is an operating system or just another user interface  in dos alone it reports 00 idle time  looks like windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that i like my students to study as the classical negative example of our times   microsoft programmers do not know batch programming   i like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this  set pathcdos  set pathcetcbinpathcbin  set pathcetcwindowspathcwindows  set pathpathcbccbin  set pathpathmouse  even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one ie cdos dos 0 installation program modifes each and every path statement and prepends cdos to its value  as a result my resultant path has so many doss  if the installation program wanted to remove the old dos path and add the new dos path clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old dos directory and replace it by the new dos path even this should only be done if the new dos is installed in a directory different from the old one being upgraded  instead the microsoft programmer if you can call this person one decided to meddle every path statement i had in the autoexec and prepend dos to the value  i wonder if microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process  i started a thread on this when dos 0 came up and the microsoft representative in singapore called me about this poster  in fact he specifically said his us counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet  now that has not changed one bit  in fact if you have a path statement with path already in it is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason  as another example of the inability of microsoft programmers to understand batch programming  i had the mouse driver invoked as  set mousecetcmouse set pathpathmouse loadhigh mousemousecom  guess what memmaker did  it replaced the last statement with  lh  cetcmousemousecom  why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with lh and its parameters without touching the rest of the line i do not understand   dos 0 software quality   dos 0 is the only operating system i know in which under normal usage you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the commands that come with it  i am deliberately being cryptic about this  i challenge microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it  if they dont within a week i will post how you can create this ghost file  surely if i can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice i am sure two dozen microsoft idiot programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it  that is what i was told how microsoft tests the quality of their products  i think it is funny that microsoft has found ways to test quality when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested but can only be built into the product  no wonder they cannot provide any form of guarantees on their products not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair  also if you run dblspace def often enough repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented you may get errors that was created by the defragmenters  i got my iosys file size error and it got truncated when i did the chkdsk  this happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since  microsft

   tim glauert thgcamorlcouk wrote   in other words it is your opinion that msw00 is inferior to its   competition  thats not the same as msw00 being objectively inferior    no  it is technically inferior to the osguis that i listed  ok now you are starting to define your criteria   by this criterion it is inferior  im afraid that you havent actually proved that  you have shown that some aspects of msw00 are technically inferior to other systems  as i said earlier if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true but some aspects of msw00 are actually technically superior to each of the other systems resource requirements performace device support printer support gui etc   btw id love to see the studies which show that unixx is as easy to   learn as windows   but i might even agree that on balance msw00 is technically inferior to some of the competition this still does not prove your point    if you have another then perhaps i am incorrect  range of available applications base os cost cost of applications cost of hardware multiplatform support  quality of the aftersales service availability of bookstraining materials support for visual and physical handicaps  suitability for use in mobile computing quality of documentation  if you think that technical excellence is the only factor when deciding on an os or indeed the primary factor you need to think again

       theres one thing about windows that really frosts me i have 00mb of ram installed in my system i use a 0mb 00mb under windows diskcache and a 0mb permanent swap file       while i can never fill the memory up i still have problems sometimes because i run out of gdi resources what gives i think windows could manage these resources a little better  are you using windows 00 or 00 if youre still on 00 00 devotes about twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently if 00 you might use one of the resource monitors such as the one that comes with the windows 00 resource kit or one of the many shareware ones available to see which programs are hogging the resources every icon internal graphics brush etc in every program running uses a certain amount of this limited memory area also some dont give it back when theyre finished  lamont downs downsnevadaedu

  all icons in program manager are aliases is that explicit  enough  apparently not many people complain about the confusion that results from the filemanagerprogman split its just a basic flaw  besides what about the control panel icons where are all those little files  
  well you may think that but you are wrong  ah the joys of networking i just hope that you forgot the   if you dont like the file manager dont use it  i dont i use ndw  i like the more modular nature of windoze  if you like things to be modular i think you would love system 0 instead of adding a line to your autoexecbat you just drop the icon into the extensions folder  just because one has had ignorance sold to one by the evil  fruit empire one is not forbidden to learn about ones file  system below the level of the gui  im still working on that one

  flangleyrhccsvaxsfasuedu writes    stuff deld for bandwidths sake  why  sigh  if you dont have more than 00mbs of memory using a ramdrive with windows is a waste of memory  windows will access upto 00mb ram better as memory  as to why what you did didnt work it is because driveletters and paths are stored inside the grouppifini files  all of the sudden things went from drive c to drive e  however if you wanted to copy an application up to the ramdrive and resetup it up that should work normally but as previously stated this will only hurt things unless youve got more than 00mbs of ram and are using whats above 00 as the ramdrive  i personally have 00mbs of ram and run a 0mb ramdrive with a great deal of success  however if you are looking to speed up windows the three things ive noted that work the best are 0 a graphics accellerator card 0 a coprocessor even an emulator helps 0 some other diskcache besides smartdrive ive tried several    and lightning for windows and norton cache give me major    headaches as well  i think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the significant amount of disk access that windows does on startup  its like its trying to its bit in wearing the damn drive out  i estimate its only reading a mb of programs  data but from the performance the drive gives it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive my drive is however regularily compressed  what is it that takes so much fuss  perhaps if ms  would take the trouble to optimize this startup process less people would  be wanting to find a solution themselves

   is anyone aware of existing ipxnetx software for windowsnt or is attachment to netware a future release please respond to internet mail raymakerbcmtmcedu thanks   i believe the beta version of the service is available via ftp on  ftpcicaindianaedu in pubpcwin0nt called something like nwntzip  there is an index ascii file there which lists the programs in that directory and what they do  unfortunately this beta will also disable netbeui and tcpip over your primary nic so if you really want to run it get yourself an extra nic and bind it to that    otherwise wait for next release like i am  adriene

   apparently not many people complain about the confusion that results from the filemanagerprogman split its just a basic flaw  i have one thing to say why does everyone say that spliting them up is such a bad thing  i actually like my program launcher and file manager do be seperate it make things easier to figure out i mean take a look  at os0s wps no flames i personally hate it cause i just have too much trouble figuring out how to do simple things like file copy  and dont say just drag the icon cause i hate icons in the first place i have too much trouble telling what all those little push buttons mean i want file copy etc   although i know im in the minority      swyattbrahmsudeledu   no disclaimeri blame everything on someone else     
  ok so if everyone is cheating is there any tests that run some  macro to load a huge drawing etc on the same machine that might  then tell us what the real world results are  i mean run the tests on the same machine with different video cards running word excel or something like that to see how fast the cards are     swyattbrahmsudeledu   no disclaimeri blame everything on someone else

  in composmswindowsmisc you write  while reading through the dos 00 book it states that the windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive  to make things compatable i removed my permanent swap file before starting the upgrade  however when all the dust settled and i go into windows it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was in the windows directory  my question is  how come the temporary swap files works ok with a compressed drive and the permanent one doesnt  you might want to look in windows faq for this one but here is my best explanation  but i cant guarantee that im not way off base  the permenant swap file is readwritten to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card  the controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital or something like that windows creates a file called spartpar in your windows directory that points to that file  it then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file  compressed disks are actually logical disks  these disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk  furthermore the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used  ie it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the bios level  because of this inbetween program windows cannot use direct methods to read from the logical disk  a permenant swap file is only there to reserve an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from dos  windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from dos to use that disk space i dont know if it does or doesntbut it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows  a temporary swap file is just a normal dos file that is accessed by windows via dos and the bios  if a disk compression program or other tsr is loaded the file access must go through dostsrs disk compressionand bios in order to be access ie never use a temporary swap filenever  more on permenent swap files  im sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested sizewindows will only use the size suggesteddo you want to create this swap file anyway or something like that  well a friend of mine robert called microsoft and asked them what and why what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 0  then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space  windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers  they also said that under absolutely no circumstancesnonewill windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size  wellthats what he  said  i call bull  if this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if its not going to use it  any takers  james  if this doesnt get to the net will someone post it for me  thanks

  my understanding is that to copy files from one directory to another on   the same drive in file manager using a mouse you hold down the ctrl key   while dragging the file from one directorys window to the other  this   works for me about 00 of the time  the other 0 the file gets   moved rather than copied  anybody else encountered this   i tried to respond by email but all attempts bounced  the condition of the ctrl key before you press the mouse button makes no difference whatsoever  you have to be holding the ctrl key when you release the mouse button if you want to force a copy operation  heres a simple experiment  select a file and begin to drag it no ctrl key  notice that the files icon disappears from the listing window  now watch what happens to that icon as you press and release the ctrl key keeping the mouse button pressed all the while  in addition the icon that you are dragging will show a  while you are holding the ctrl key indicating that the file is being copied rather than moved   bob nichols att bell laboratories rnicholsihlpmihattcom

  hello      im investigating the purchase of an object oriented application framework  i have come across a few that look good    zapp 00 from inmark   zinc 00 from zinc software   cviews from liant   win from blaise  some considerations im using    being new to windows programming im from the unixx world the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important  however since im not adverse to learning the internals of windows programming the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one  i dont believe arbitrary levels of abstraction just for the sake of changing the api are valuable    since we will be developing for the 00bit windows nt system the memory management issues and issues particular to the windows 00 api are less important     we will probably buy another c class library something like toolsh or booch components from rational to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  allocators etc  so those features are not that important for this toolkit to have  the two that i have narrowed it down to are zapp and zinc they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media  i was wondering if anyone had any firsthand experience with any of these toolkits especially zapp and zinc  a couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are  zapp    seems to have the most extensive coverage of windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes   has new fancy 0dstyle controls available and support for custom controls   has a windows nt version essential   redirectable graphics displayoutput architecture useful for printing   sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize   seems to be the newcomer this could be an advantage in designing a better system   zinc    has a platform independent resource strategy  not too important for me right now   comes with a interface builder tool   has a windows nt version essential   seems to have been around longer more mature but grew up out of a dos version     had a better demo   both have source code availability options both are lacking ole support neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff   any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated  thanks   brett harper   brettharpercimlinccom

  you have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in windows than in dos  regardless of what communication software you are using  try the following    0 turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to  the        cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine        it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters     0 use a different uart for your serial line  the old uarts 0000 or 00000        can only buffer one character internally  the new uarts 00000 can        buffer 00 which should be plenty for most situations  you can run        windowsmsdexe to find out what uart is on the machine  ron  
  rmohnsvaxclarkuedu writes  windows nt is a giant windows operating system  unline win00 it does not  run on top of dos  it is its own os with billy gates assures us true  multitaskingmultithreading meets dod security specs will run win00  programs as well as dos programs has multiprocessor support and is primarily a server program  its overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users  correction  all billy is promising is that it will run most windows 00 programs and the major dos programs  do not expect everything you have to run under nt unless all you have are current ms apps

   as the subjects says windows 00 keeps crashing givinh me gpf on me of   late  it was never a very stable package but now it seems to crash every   day  the worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently ie i   cant reproduce crashes and they are not always gpfs in the same   application sometimes i can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error but other times windows acts very strange and i   need to reboot  some background  i have a leading edge 000sx00 with phoenix bios  when i   first got it it had 0mg of memory  it ran windows fine not too many   gpfs  then a couple of weekends ago i installed lotus 000 for windows   with atm a game card and an additional 0  0mg simms  the leading edge   machine is kind of strange in that it has the ide controler built into   the motherboard the cpu is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the simms it uses are macintosh simms apparently i   was told that the leading edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board  the original 0mg 00ns simms where of the 0 chip variety from   samsung and the ones i installed are 0 chip simms they are recognized   fine by the bios ram check the game card is a generic 00 gamecard  the reason why i mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctlaltdel still leaves   the machine kind of flaky but turning it on and off doesnt   i havent tried taking out the ram or the game card because as i said   these gpf are not reproducible at will  i have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then i might get 0 or so gpfs   in the sppace of 00 minutes  what can i do  this situation is most annoying are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware do you think that this might be a software   problem ie emm000 etc if it helps i have manage to get gpfs on after   dark quicken paint shop pro a lot of them have been in userexe or   gdiexe  any help is truly appreciated  eric  eboscousoraclecom

   when i first setup windows using the self load mode it grabbed about 00 megs of swap file space my 000 meg hd was nearly empty at that time i deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded now my hd is nearly full and windows just took 0 megs  one of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous nonfragmented space  i suspect that is more responsible for the difference than the amount of free disk in your case  i have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your permanent swap file the same size as your regular ram size  i have 0 megs of ram and windows took 0 meg perm swap file  works very well in fact with my available hd space about 00 megs it wont let me make the swap file any bigger you should change your virtual mem swap file to 0 megs i think that is what you said your ram was  it depends on what you are running  we had to increase our swap file i think it is now 00mb when some applications couldnt run without everything else closed    mike lipsie                                work mlipsiecamerlcom mitsubishi electronic research laboratory  home mikeldosbearsuucp

  after setting up windows for using my cirrus logic 0000 vlb graphicscard it moved a normal window from one place to another  my parameters where just the following  000 dx 00 vlb  the card is equipped with 0 mb dram not vram there are 0 sockets for vram  and the moving of the window just looked like it looked at a friends 000dx 00 000dx and an normal isa et0000  what i was wondering why is it not using the bitblt  engine which is suuposed to be on the chip  how are the experiences here have i done something wrong  i installed the mswin 00 multiresolution drivers which where supplied  with the card  would be nice if somebody could tell about his experience with this card also if there are newhopefully faster drrivers around i would love to  how to get hold of them  ftp or whatsoever    gruss wolfgang     
  kentilermattksuksuedu kent p iler writes     i have normal procomm plus for dos but ive been considering buying  the windows versionit got really great reviews in computer shopper  i have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here  using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the  modemhe has a 00000 modem on a 000 00 mhz machine  i cant  see it having trouble keeping up  his pcplus for dos works great  re what to do after the high speed modem arrives       edition 00 apr 00  this article applies only to windows 00 and 00 and not to nt os0 or dos apps not running under windows  one of the unadvertised limitations of most current windows pcs is that their rs000c serial com performance is seriously deficient  almost everyone who purchases a highspeed modem v00bis v00 pep or hst discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming fax at 0000 after upgrading the modem  overrun and retry errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or fax program  if the transfer completes at all it may take even longer than with the old 0000bps modem   there are three reasons for the problem  0 the universal asynchronous receivertransmitters uarts used in most    pcs are primitive ns0000 devices with singlebyte fifo buffers  if the    operating systemdriver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the fifo and    the previous one is lost  dos being a fairly singleminded    environment during datacomm can usually keep up windows cant  0 windows has more operating system overhead than plain dos and    interrupts often take longer to service  overruns are much more likely    than under dos  as soon as you report to your pcmodem vendor that you    are losing data you may be advised that you need to upgrade to a    00000 more likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue  youll get no useful advice at all  most of the    storefront and mailorder sources i spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term 00000 and many didnt even    know what a uart was  0 even your pc has ns00000a uarts and ps0s do or if you can upgrade    your mothercom board or add a new com board you may still experience    errors and overruns because the standard microsoft windows com drivers    dont take full advantage of the 00000  windows 00 is improved in this    regard over 00 but i still recommend a driver upgrade  applications    like procommwin which is what i use cannot get around this problem    by themselves  if you have a modem card you may not have a problem as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the uart and avoid overrunning it however i wouldnt want to bet that the card designers were that clever and will insist on a 00000 uart if i ever buy a modem card  some modem cards dont even have conventional uarts but if they are to work with standard windows drivers they need to simulate one use msdexe below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to be   the hardware situation  the uarts on most pc com ports are based on national semiconductor ns0000 or ns00000 chips or megacells inside vlsi chips where you cant replace them  you can id the uart type on your system by running the microsoft diagnostic program windowsmsdexe  be sure to run it in dos before bringing up windows   the windows serial api may prevent msd from accurately identifying a 00000 if you run it from a windows dos prompt  the ns00000 uart has separate 00byte transmit and receive fifos with configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to 000000 bps although with current modem technology theres no point in pushing your luck by going over 000000 bps the 00000 has shorted access cycle times than the 00000 or 0000  the 00000 also has dma capability but it is not clear that any pc drivers ever use this  for more technical info see national semiconductor application note an000  so what uart component do you have  try to locate the uart on your mother board multifunction io card com board or isamca modem card  if you cant find a socketed component with the numbers 0000 or 00000 your com ports are probably buried in vlsi and you wont be able to perform a chip replacement  if you can disable your vlsi com ports as i chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket com board  if you have one or more socketed 0000 or 00000 chips you can buy plugin ns00000afn or pc00c000cn low power cmos version ics from several suppliers typically for 0 to 00 each  the n chip is the normal 00pin dualinline package  other styles are available but avoid any ns00000 chips without the a the 00c000c are presumably all ok  early ns chips have bugs although national will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free  clone chips are available from various ic makers other than national  the manual for the turbocom drivers states support for the following apparently equivalent chips national semiconductor 00000a 00000 00000 chipstechnology       00c000 texas instruments      t00c000a silicon systems        00m000 vlsi                    00c000 turbocom warns about the prea ns00000 and western digital 00c000 says that problems have been reported with early ibm ps0 00sx and 00 systems ibm reportedly will upgrade them  if you dont have socketed 000000000 chips youll need to buy an after market com or multifunction board if this is a modem card situation you may be hosed to add a new com or multifunction card youll need to either disable the com00 ports you are replacing or reassign them to com00 although watch out for irq conflicts without turbocom  although cheaper cards are available in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly i elected buy the modular circuit technology mctaio card from  jdr microdevices 0000 samaritan drive san jose  ca  00000 000

except jdr  meanwhile back at the mct card from jdr i only needed two serial ports and am running out of irqs on my pc so i disabled my builtin vlsibased 0000 ports however with the turbocom driver below i could have set the internals as com0 and 0 using irq sharing   the software situation  simply upgrading to 00000 uarts will not completely solve common overrun problems  the standard ms serial drivers dont take full advantage of the 00000 the windows 00 drivers are even less capable and the windows 00 drivers have the following limitations   they enable only the receive fifo and only at rates above 0000 bps   they never enable the transmit fifo which  results in an interrupt    rate of 00x during uploads   they set the trigger level at 00 bytes too high  its easy for 0    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the fifo   the ports menu of the control panel only allows speeds up to 00000    with a v00bis modem  sparse data and text can easily compress 00    or more suggesting that a host dte connect rate of 00000 bps would    be effective   the api wont accept rates above cbr000000   the api wont let dos programs know there is a 00000 there and even    if it did dos programs that arent 00000aware get little benefit    from a 00000 port with the standard drivers   they dont allow irq sharing for com00   the bios doesnt initialize com00 properly in many systems   windows provides no workaround for apps that dont provide port    speed options above 00000 bps  these problems are reportedly not solved in windows nt or dos 00 and may or may not be addressed in any windows releases after 00 but before 00 rumors suggest they may be solved in windows 00  you can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of turbocom current version 00 from  bioengineering research pacific commware division 000 beacon hill lane ashland  or   000000000 000 0000000 voice 000 0000000 fax 000 0000000 bbs mcimail    0000000 compuserve 00000000  price was around 00 as i recall  bioeng is not set up to accept credit cards so i had to send a check  egghead and 0000software list turbocom but as far as i know they dont stock it  bio is not a software company per se  they apparently needed reliable hispeed serial connections for an inhouse instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a market for it revised it to be a general purpose com driver suite they recently upgraded it for windows 00  it is runtime licensed  i now have my host dte connect rate set to 00000 bps most of  my datacomm apps and i am having zero problems with downloads i routinely see transfer rates that exceed 0000 bps i am also using 000000 bps when linking an hp00lx to my pc with lossless bidirectional io uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts are still using antique uarts and drivers  note that 00000 is still the highest rate that the windows 00 port menu in control panel will allow in configuring a com port  turbocom gets around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real uart rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the windows apis and dialog boxes  i also have ctsrts hardware flow control enabled and i suggest that you do the same  even if you only ever transfer 0bit ascii data xonxoff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control  the informal dec standard for xonxoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 00 yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the xoff from the receiving system or device  the 00 byte fifo in the 00000 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on xonxoff  a wellrespected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 00000s cant really do ctsrts all by itself in the doswindows environment so using data rates above 000000 may still be risky  even with hardware flow control a 00000 with turbocom can still experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress if this is your situation you may need to buy a coprocessed com board but this will cost you more than a 00000turbocom upgrade  a review of two such boards and a review of turbocom can be found in the feb00 issue of windows sources magazine i suggest trying a 00000turbocom upgrade first and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a power user whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems   closing soapbox comments  the state of rs000c serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry  because it is the oldest standard io interface the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies  the design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art in my last job with a major workstation vendor i lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system  that family of machines was subsequently introduced with 00000 ports  however this is the exception  few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent io  you may as well learn what you can about serial io because this situation shows no sign of improving soon  when vfast arrives i expect cries of outrage from windows users worldwide whose 0000 pcs sort of work today with v00 but will fail miserably with vfast  without a hardwarebuffered uart like the 00000 and without software drivers that use that uart to best advantage a vfast modem will be a waste of money  regards

  wildaccessdigexcom wildstrom writes  rmohnsvaxclarkuedu writes  chicogo is what i want to use  it is like nt a true os with thrue  multitasking and multithreading but has much smaller hardware requirements  and does not meet dod security specs but thats okay since it will probably  be more of a client os  there are a few otehr differences but those are the  main ones  there was an article about chicogo in pc week last august the chicogo and nt development groups at microoft are in intense  competition so it is said  however i think a different relationship will  arise nt will be the server netowrk techonology chicogo will be the  client machine  it is entirely possible for different oss to work together  partly because chicogo is just a small nt think of it that way anyway   novell netware creates an os on the server that is truly not dos so dont scorn the concept anyway dont expect it soon  windows 0 and dos 0 are supposed to be  released next year read see it in 00 so i expect that chicogo wont be out  til 00 how does chicago differ from the sort of announced windows 0 my understand ing at least from the inbfoworld accound of windows 0 is that its sort of nt litea fullfledged operating system but lacking server and security features that make nt such a bear is w0 not true multithreading    can anyone tell me how chicagowindows 0 would differ from os0 0x  believe it or not im not trying to start a flame war here   im simply curious  if there is going to be any feature advantage in either of these products i do not consider the fact that it has uncle bills seal of approval much of a feature  
   does anybody have any idea where i could find a program that can convert a gif image into a bmp image suitable for a windows  wallpaper ie 000 colors  hopefully theres something out there i can get from an ftp site somewhere  thanks in advance  scott

   now does anyone know if it is possible to use w0wg and lan workplace for dos at the same time   ie can i access a file on another pc while being logged on to the mainframe at the same time simultaneously  yup  were using both and they work just fine  hopefully someday wfwg will communicate over lwp tcpip  right now we have to load netbeui  i use odi with odinsup and all works well

  while there are too many ps clones to count some of which are quite poor trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience three questions come to mid real quick for something like this  qwhich version of adobe ps will we clone aside from the level 0 and level 0 issues adobe has in the past released new code that incorporates modificationsupgradesfixes just as all other software vendors do the level 0 stuff may seem sound now but i assure youchanges will become more frequent as their customer list begins to dwindle in the face of competition this allows them to shift people to maintenance as well as design efforts for level 0  qdo we duplicate the bugs or do we make it work correctly from the laserwriter to the laserjet 0 there have been bugs if i had a number to call at hp or adobe theyld have heard from me deciding which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate  qdo we follow the red book or do we follow someones implementation without a doubt there are differences between the red book and adobes ps with level 0 many issues have been refined but the red book does leave big big holes in the implementation specific stuff it would be nice it the red bood at least pined things down enough so that two different implementations of adobes ps dont do the exact opposite given an identical set of conditions  qpscriptdrv having done a lot of ps clone testing myself the unfortunate side of testing is the limited number of sources for test files the primary source we use is genoa and having characterizes their 0000 ps ats files 0000 of them over half are taken from pscriptdrv it may not ideal but the ats files are what the printer vendors use im sure that adobe uses them too but adobes output is by definition correct even if its wrong  yes there are some very poor clones weve seen them here at rastek a sub of genicom which has its own clone called geniscript some are poor for lack of design some are poor because they followed the red book and some are poor because the vendors dont know what ps is  don newbolddonrastekcom

  hi there im having a bizarre video problem within windows 00  i have a 000 with a gvga00 video board  ive been using the standard windows vga driver with other similarly configured computers  i am thinking that my problem is with the way windows refreshes its screen  the problem is that once windows has been envoked the colors start changing themselves  at first i thought it was hardware but if you open a full screen dos program from within the windows session you dont have any problems until you get back to windows  however when you initially return to windows the original colors get refreshed properly  also it is not a uniform color change  so if you are in solitaire the design on the back of the card maintains its original color scheme but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey then blue etc  the color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purpleish black  if you pop out to dos and exit back to windows  the screen gets refreshed again  if i dont log into windows and just do dos things from the novell network everything is fine  i originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine i had just finished configuring then from the net to this machine  when i ran into problems i deleted everything on this machine and the net and tried bouncing it again  when that didnt work i tried reloading windows to no avail  any thoughts on things to check out  i am totally baffled  thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction  linda cornell lcornelluwashingtonedu uw office of research  
      somewhere in this thread it has been said that windows nt tm is a     multiuser os as well as multithreading etc  i certainly havent    seen this to be the case  there are seperate accounts for each person    and even seperate directories if that is desired  i dont see an     implentation of simultaneuos use though     scott  it certainly is multiuser what i have seen from the march beta is that it doesnt yet come with the stuff which exploits multiuser features i remember somebody from ms stating that it doesnt allow two users share one gui my interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and rpc based stuff you want   i believe ftp and rlogin deamons for nt systems will come from third party somebody already has a beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net there is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on unix for remote logins   in general i liked nt when i checked it out it slow compared to win00 just like any other real os the beta version although being slow botts up much faster than my sun workstation windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than x windows i believe bill gates was right when he stated that nt was not for everybody after playing around with it for a while i was convinced if i owned a busines using a business computer from ibm or some other established vendor i would consider moving to nt platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution if you are running sql servers etc it provides the robustness such an application requires   on the other hand if you like your dos games more or less forget about nt you can always boot to dos  but in general that defeats the purpose of using nt most of nts features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you cant reboot your machine at will for personal use i would rather wait for the win00 based windows release whatever you name it than jump to nt bandwagon i expect most applications will keep on using win00 until win00 becomes widely available    sadun anik u of illinois at urbanachampaign center for reliable and highperformance computing email anikcrhcuiucedu

   somewhere in this thread it has been said that windows nt tm is a  multiuser os as well as multithreading etc  i certainly havent seen this to be the case  there are seperate accounts for each person and even seperate directories if that is desired  i dont see an  implentation of simultaneuos use though  since running any gui over a network is going to slow it down by a fair amount i expect windows nt will be multiuser only in the sense of sharing filesystems someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run characterbased apps but graphicsbased apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local cpu this is how things are shaping up everywhere clientserver architectures are taking over from the old cputerminal setups   note that the next does this you can always telnet into a next and run characterbased apps but you cant run the gui yeah i know about xwindows just havent been too impressed by it          iskandar taib                           the only thing worse than peach ala internet ntaibsilverucsindianaedu     frog is frog ala peach bitnet   ntaibiubacs

  hi  while running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows 00  this evening i got a program has violated system integrity close all  applications exit windows and restart your computer error  i started to do this when i immediately got a serious disk error message from windows  hit return to retry  i did that about 0 times and then rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow i am including the chkdsk output below  questions  0  is there an easy way to restore everything to working order what might be some better approaches  0  what might have caused this  does the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable  im suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing  the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to  fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things  thanks for your comments and suggestions  brad banko  ps  this is a 000sx machine with a 00mb hard drive and 0 mb of ram   chkdsk output  volume serial number is 000000d0 errors found f parameter not specified corrections will not be written to disk  cgfxvpic00cvpicexe    allocation error size adjusted cgfxvpic00vpictxt    allocation error size adjusted cgfxvpic00video0cfg    allocation error size adjusted cgfxvpic00orcpro0cfg    allocation error size adjusted cgfxvpic00vgacfg    allocation error size adjusted cgamegoosebird0x    allocation error size adjusted cwinmiscadv00winadvexe    allocation error size adjusted     000 lost allocation units found in 000 chains     000000 bytes disk space would be freed  cgfxvpic00cvpicexe    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00geno0000cfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00tri0000bcfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00ts0000hicfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00configdoc    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00vpictxt    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00video0cfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00definconcfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00atiwondrcfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00geno0000cfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00oakcfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00hirescfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00aheadacfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00vpicdoc    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00orcpro0cfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00everx000cfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00waitcom    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00maxxoncfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00waitdoc    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00everx000cfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00egacfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00configexe    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00readme0st    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgfxvpic00vgacfg    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cgamegoosebird0x    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cwindowssystemsounddrv    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cwindowsgames0grp    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cwindowsmad0000bmp    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cmagedemo00akin    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cmagedemo00bkin    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cmagepkin00exe    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cwinmiscgamesdialwordexe    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cwinmiscgamesdialwordtxt    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cwinmiscadv00winadvwri    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cwinmiscadv00advkey    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cwinmiscadv00advrec    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cwinmiscadv00freezer    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 c000spartpar    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000 cbng0mbx    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000    00000000 bytes total disk space    0000000 bytes in 0 hidden files     000000 bytes in 00 directories   00000000 bytes in 0000 user files    0000000 bytes available on disk        0000 bytes in each allocation unit      00000 total allocation units on disk        000 available allocation units on disk      000000 total bytes memory     000000 bytes free   brad banko  dept of physics  u of illinois  bbankouiucedu  see one  do one  teach one00 de kb0cne  n0lnqil

  i just got a copy of tobias managing your money v00  i have quicken 0 and its wonderful for some things but mym seems to have some features that q0 doesnt  for example q0 doesnt seem to be able to handle monthly automatic deductions from a checking account you know a monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from my checking account  or is there something that im not doing right and q0 can actually do that  anyway mym seems to be able to handle monthly deductions  in fact it can apparently do better than that that is you can specify monthly bimonthly quarterly even yearly anyway is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs or can someone just give me their own personal impressions  maybe someone who has used both  or maybe someone who is familiar with each could give me a capsule review  anything would be greatly appreciated  if i keep mym i have to pay for it and i dont know whether its worth doing  if mym is better than q0 of course i will keep it  but if q0 can do everything mym can do maybe even better i wont  thanks all  if you post a reply please also cc me  thanks

  i am a novice at best in working with pc networks and am in the process of planning a small accounting system for a small business  the particular need in this case is for three machines each in a different office of the same building each having access to a windowsbased accounting system  my first thought is to set up ms windows for workgroups on each of the machines likely a 000 and two 000s along with the appropriate ethernet cards and cabling that come with the windows for workgroups starter kit one additional user kit will be necessary  it then seems logical to purchase a simple multiuser accounting system along the lines of daceasy or myob and fire it all up  the 000 will more or less act as server with a reportcheck printer attached to it cable runs of 0000 feet will be necessary for this setup  well this all seems too easy to me  would any of you network gurus out there tell me if i am out of my mind here  any and all suggestions however trivial will be immensely appreciated  my apologies if this has been brought up before  thanks  john   john e martin    jemartinnyxcsduedu      university of puget sound 00     kent wa     formerly martinupsedu   seinfeldsupersonicsrushbelafleck   john e martin    jemartinnyxcsduedu      university of puget sound 00     kent wa     formerly martinupsedu   seinfeldsupersonicsbcrushdweckl

  wrote    i just got a copy of tobias managing your money v00  i have quicken 0  and its wonderful for some things but mym seems to have some features  that q0 doesnt  for example q0 doesnt seem to be able to handle  monthly automatic deductions from a checking account you know a  monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from  my checking account  or is there something that im not doing right  and q0 can actually do that    hi      i have never used mym so i can not help you with the comparison of the two products  i am however  a devoted quicken user and i can tell you how to set up the weekly monthly quarterly yearly transactions  first use the memorize feature ctrlm to record the recurring transactions  next define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used ie monthly  quicken willcan not automatically make the transactions for you but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once  additionally if you are using the bill minder it will remind you when each transaction group is due  for example you could have three transaction groups  one for payments at the beginning of the month middle of the month and one for quarterly payments  i hope this helps  mike  
   software that comes together with the videoblaster is designed to work together with the soundblaster from the same manufacturer  since i do not own a soundblaster is there a possibility to use the pc speaker driver to play audio files for the videoblaster avi  audio video interleave files   i think what i should have is a device driver for the media player that controls the pc speaker driver instead of the soundblaster card something like mcispkrdrv  has anybody heard of such a driver or am i on the wrong track  any information on this appreciated  please send email since i dont watch this group regularly       v        joerg meyer              email  jmeyerinformatikuniklde    o o       university of kaiserslautern germany ooouooo     this space for rent

   i just got off the phone with mathsoft technical service they are now admitting a problem of unknown nature with maple and norton desktop for windows they have no clue at this time and are collecting configuration information on the systems which exhibit the problem anyone having problems loading the maple solver in mathcad 00 under ndw shoud call technical support at 0000000000 they made no schedule promices but are actively working on the problem  in the meantime the workaround is to provide a configuration selection in autoexecbat to use progman yuk pew whenever you plan to use the maple solver and ndw otherwise i am using norton be to place a little menu on the screen with a 0 second timeout to auto boot ndw                           david a fuess                              dir center for eecs                        phone 0000000000              fax   0000000000   lawrence livermore national laboratory

  walther id have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering id only suggest using the color screen if it does 000000 without flickering if this is not too small for your tastes at a 00 personally id prefer the monoscreen as i always have quite a few windows open if you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color surplus is worth trading in  the smaller size if you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors i used a 00 mono screen worst of both worlds and was surprised how the colors looked i choose on a color screen   regards olaf winkelhake  
  i have heard many things about the ati ultra pro card some have been positive but most are negative could people please confirm these  i am interested in the eisa version in particular  0 the card does not work in a system with 00m ram  0 the card works in a 00m system with some switches    set but it is much slower  0 the card is interlaced in its 00bit truecolour modes  0 the latest build 00 drivers still do not work in many    cases  0 this card is the fastest full colour card for the money  0 this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread   thanks for your feedback i will summarize  al    alan walford     eos systems inc vancouverbc canada  tel 0000000000 aeweosvcrwimseybcca           or        uunetwimseybccaeosvcraew    
  i would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few  questions about windows for workgroups  i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver 00 i am considering moving all our machines to w0wg  q0  how much conventional ram does w0wg use over and above the      driver for the network card  q0  if i have a novell ne0000 card are the lsl and ipx drivers      still needed  q0  does w0wg do a license check over the network to ensure each      machine is running its own licenced copy of w0wg note i do      not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy      of w0wg for each of our machines it is just that i would like      to try it out first to see if it meets our needs returning one      opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies  q0  if you buy the upgrade to windows 00 for w0wg does it replace      all of win 00 as you install it or does it depend on current      win 00 files  q0  if i install windows nt on my server when it comes out will i have      any troubles with the w0wg machines  when i started this message i was going to ask only 0 questions but i got carried away ill stop now   i look forward to your replies  al    alan walford     eos systems inc vancouverbc canada  tel 0000000000 aeweosvcrwimseybcca           or        uunetwimseybccaeosvcraew    
  hi weve been having problems on a few setups when printing to a serial printer dmp or laser i have used works and windows write the output is ok from dos and if i send plain text output but anything fancy garbles or just doesnt output the exception is outputting to a lserjet 0 which appears to be fast enough receiving data not to bother about handshaking messages im sure im not alone in this ive tried most of the printnetwork manager options i can think of anyone had similar problems theyve cured and would like to tell me bout it thanks  john atherton      
  anyway is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs or can someone just give me their own personal impressions  maybe  pc magazine january 00 0000 had a review of several personal finance management programe as did pccomputing january 0000  pc world december 0000 also had articles about quicken and managing your money i can email you copies of these articles if you cant find them at your library  ive been using managing your money for several years and i have several friends who use quicken though ive not used it myself  my overall impression is that quicken is a financial accounts manager while managing your money will help you more completely manage your finances  here are some features that i believe managing your money and quicken share  the ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts checking savings charge cash or brokerage  you can reconcile your account statements with the records the program keeps  the ability to make a budget and track your spending against that budget  a checkfree module which will allow you to use the checkfree bill paying service to pay your bills via your modem  the ability to print checks on your printer  the ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments  the ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts up to date  i know managing your money can do this automatically via modem  quicken probably can as well but im not sure about it  the ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation programs   here are some features that i believe managing your money has that quicken does not  a tax prediction module  this looks at your accounts and budget to predict your tax liability for the coming year  its usefull to fine tune your withholding so uncle sam doesnt get his due too early  an insurance and vital records module  this is a place to keep records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records it can also compute your life expectancy  a financial analysis module  this computes compound interest  effects of inflation loan payments term or interest yield to maturity for bonds savings account yields days between dates and loan amortization schedules  it also has functions to help you  decide whether to refinance your mortgage whether you can afford a particular home whether a particular rental property is a good investment whether you should buy lease or rent and whether a particular investments cash flow is adequate for your situation this module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping your kids with their tuition    a net worth module  this is a place to record all your assets and liabilities  your net worth can be computed from this  information  any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules are automatically included here  a desk module  this includes a small word processor a card file you can use to store names addresses phone numbers and other vital information about friends and associates a perpetual calander a rudimentary calculator a todo list a reminder list an appointment list and a place to record your phone calls for those who need to track such things  your appointments reminders and todo list can be made to display automatically when you start the program  there are probably some things listed above that quicken has but im almost sure that quicken doesnt do everything ive listed  if im wrong im sure hordes of quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp  one thing that quicken has that managing your money does not yet have is a  windows version  meca software is rumored to be working on a windows version of managing your money for release late this year  i hope this information is of use to you  ive found managing your money to be a very usefull program for keeping my financial records  on the other hand i know many people who are equally as happy with quicken  if quicken has all the features you need or want id go with it if you find any of the managing your money features that quicken doesnt have to be useful i think its well worth the price

  hi    have you used mac system 0x or 0x if the answer is positive you would know if mswindows is a mature os  this is silly is unix a mature os depends on who you ask and how you define mature system 0 is if anything less mature than windows 00    days ago people doubted that mswindows is not a real os i can see why they have such question mswindows confuses many people microsoft simulated mac but it did a lousy job  for example  0 you can not create hierarchy groups there is no way to create a group     in a group if you know how please tell me  so why do you need something like behierarchic to create groups under the apple menu everyone knows that apple menu items are a ripoff of the program manager if you want a hierarchic program launcher there are lots available  0 uncomplete documentation its not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error  and this is easy on a mac give me a break having spent hours moving system extensions around and restarting the mac to see why a certain app crashes all the time i find this laughable  0 group deletingfile deleting     after deleting a group users have to use file manager to delete files     but if users forget to delete some related files the disk will be full     of nonsense files  oh great ever hear of aliases wonder why apple implemented them  0 share problem     once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language wo good editor there will be a sharing problem you just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded it makes sense to     prevent from saving but not opening  eh i dont follow    its by no means easy to satisfy everybody but if microsoft want to keep their reputations they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute  why is it that i find the mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever i use it     no flame please  yeah right you post flame bait yet ask for no flames             iskandar taib                           the only thing worse than peach ala internet ntaibsilverucsindianaedu     frog is frog ala peach bitnet   ntaibiubacs

   i have heard many things about the ati ultra pro card some have  been positive but most are negative could people please confirm  these  i am interested in the eisa version in particular    0 the card does not work in a system with 00m ram  the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only as far as i know  the vlb and eisa version should have no problems    0 the card works in a 00m system with some switches     set but it is much slower  again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 000m ram eisa and vlb or 00 m isa  00m should not be a problem for you     0 the card is interlaced in its 00bit truecolour modes  nope  i can use 000x000 at 00hz 00bit and 000x000 at 00hz 00bit all noninterlaced    0 the latest build 00 drivers still do not work in many     cases  they arent perfect but are much improved  i dont recall the last time which i had to leave mach 00 mode ati gup mode and switch to 0000 or vga mode due to software incompatibility    0 this card is the fastest full colour card for the money  its quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate    0 this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread   i like it    daniel matthew coleman      internet dcolemanutxvmsccutexasedu   dcolemanccwfccutexasedu the university of texas at austin   decnet utxvmsdcoleman electricalcomputer engineering    bitnet dcolemanutxvms bitnet

   we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using w0wg for a while now  we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway  you also need a tcpip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but thats what they require to get the smtp gateway to work  you need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff  we do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do    there is a glitch somewhere in the system though  i dont know if it is ms mail the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent  the scenario is this  the outgoing mail goes to a unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go  if that mail is routed to the vax the vax has problems some times receiving the mail most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the vax forwarded to some other location  that is the main gotcha where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying boudary error garbage code stuff  if you can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok  the system people of course say that the vax is not the problem the gateway is probably the problem  if anyone wants to get help it is only 00000 for one support call until problem is worked out  phooey to that i say  i am looking vigorously for a better idea    if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew  please drop me a note  anyone  the next itteration is supposed to have tcpip built in they say  the netxt itteration of w0wg  good luck     wes james                   email  wesjextsparcagsciusuedu   utah state university   cooperative extension   systems specialist   umc 0000                    voice  0000000000   logan ut 000000000          fax  0000000000

   ive been reading with much confusion about whether or not to use atmanager lately all the packages ive been buying have all included atmanager as a bonus i do some desktop publishing using pagemaker and coreldraw coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over 000 diff types add that to the ttfonts that come with win00 and you have a decent amount of fonts i print my creations out on an hp0 postcript at 000 dpi resolution with the resolution enhancement  technology and   well  i get some darn good copies  so good that there isnt any diff whether or not atmanager is turned on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technologies  and tt    avdean

      dear friend      the risc means reduced instruction set computer the risc usually has     small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase     the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some books about    computer architecture for more information about risc  risc used to mean reduced instruction set computer true  they still use the same acronym but only to be familiar  what risc really means is a recentlydesigned cpu    in general most risc cpus are like this      a large number 00 or more of generalpurpose registers     a fixed instruction size usually 00 bits     an instruction may make only one memory reference     memory references must be aligned     there are delayed branches branch after the next instruction or a target prediction bit probably willwont branch     instructions may complete out of order relative to the instruction stream   richard krehbiel                                 richkgrebyncom os0 00 will do for me until amigados for the 000 comes along

   i am considering buying borlands paradox for windows since i  would like to use a database with windows i dont haveuse  one yet for both workhome use  i would like to advantage  of borlands 00000 until april 00 offer if this package  is everything that borland claims it to be  so i was  wondering  has anybody used this andor have any opinions  yes and its pretty much what they claim  i havent had time to try all of it  considering the price even if you decide you dont like it it should be saleable over the next 00 months for what you have in it once the price goes up  all in all its very serviceable and in my humble opinion more powerful than access

  i just purchased the norton desktop for windows and i also have norton utilities  when i installed ndw it wanted to rem out the line that installed ep ep on and the command to invoke the image utility it replaced the image command with a new image command that invokes the version of image that came with ndw  this makes sense as presumably the image version with ndw is newer than the one with nu  it did not however install smartcan in the autoexec  now two questions    0  will nu use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked        ie are the two version of image compatable    0  will erase protect use the info from smartcan and vice versa        i use both dos and windows and i want to make sure that when i        erase files in either environment they are going to be protected  from the experiments i have run the two programs erase protect and smart erase dont use each others info i currently have both ep and smartcan loading within my autoexec and i dont see any conflicts  fyi   norton desktop for windows version 00        norton utils version 0  thanks for any help  
  word 00c doesnt show the periodcentred character to indicate spaces if i use the ttfonts from coreldraw  our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box  they overlap each other and characters on each side which is useless  i believe the character used by w0w is the periodcentred 0000 this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this  i have edited the corel font with fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0000 character makes no difference to the font output in charmap or w0w altering the paragraph 0000 or cedilla 0000 does alter their font graphics displayed however  is the w0w character used to indicate spaces the periodcentred character  has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a coreldraw ttf                                                                              russ sharp    russdeakineduau    ph 00000 0000    fax 00000 0000     deakin university school of engineering  technology geelong australia

     here is an annoying problem whenever i save an icon which contains dark colors like dark red or dark purple these colors are converted to the bright colors this happens with every icon editor including the image editor that came with sdk i dont have this problem with bmp files either only with ico files or icon libraries the problem is with the icon colormap field in the icon file header checking the file with a binary editor i can see that the masks are ok by editing the colormap manually copying from another icon that i didnt edit i can fix the colors does anybody know what may be causing this problem   thanks     sadun anik u of illinois at urbanachampaign center for reliable and highperformance computing email anikcrhcuiucedu

   ive been reading with much confusion about whether or not to use atmanager lately all the packages ive been buying have all included atmanager as a bonus  adobe has been doing this for years  i do some desktop publishing using pagemaker and coreldraw coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over 000 diff types add that to the ttfonts that come with win00 and you have a decent amount of fonts i print my creations out on an hp0 postcript at 000 dpi resolution with the resolution enhancement  technology and   well  i get some darn good copies  so good that there isnt any diff whether or not atmanager is turned on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technologies  and tt  there are some fonts that are only available as ps fonts  if you have a ps font that you want to use use atm  otherwise it is a waste of system resources  personally i use both    mike lipsie                                work mlipsiecamerlcom mitsubishi electronic research laboratory  home mikeldosbearsuucp  
  has anyone experienced a faint shadow at all resolutions using this card is only in windows i have replaced card and am waiting on  latest drivers also have experienced general protection fault errors in wspdpsfdrv on winword tools option menu and in winfax setup i had a ati ultra but was getting genral protection fault errors in an spss application these card manufactures must have terrible quality control to let products on the market with so many bugs what a hassle running on gateway 0000 dx000 thx dave l  i have used both version 000 drivers for win 00 and the new 000 drivers i have had none of these problems  no gpfs at all  i have a feeling that your problems are not with the card or drivers  the ati ultra drivers are considered some of the most reliable on the market and the ss 00x ones  seem quite good as well  maybe you should check bios problems in your gateway  i know a few people with gateway dx0s and all of them have found some problem or other with compatibility  especially with graphics  the only gpfs i have ever had can be directly attributable to using abusing applications  i even got the newest drivers from diamond when  people started complaining  i still only have one small problem with them and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes reads to the swap file    greg bishop

  hi there  we are running a 000 node token ring with windows 00 and novell 000  every once in a while we run into the black screen of death a phrase coined by robert x cringely in a recent infoworld column    basically sometimes when you quit windows the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen  also sometimes when you exit to dos the same effect occurs cringely hints that microsoft andor novell has a patch for windows virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this  neither company seems to know what i am talking about when i call them  has anyone else noticed this phenomenon    is there a fix for it  any response is welcome  peter sweeney psweeneymiavx0acsmuohioedu

  i am getting garbled output when serial printing thru windows  works etc  this has occurred on several systems and goes if a laserjet 0 is used  i suspect that there is no need for handshaking in this case due to the capacity memoryspeed of it  there is no problem printing from dos  are there any obvious tweaks im missing  im sure its not just me with this problem  thanks for reading  john atherton

  reposting and summarizing for your information or additional comment   this is long   i have 00mb of memory on my 000sx 00 mhz an intel math coprocessor and a 000mb hard drive with 00mb free no compression  i have been running mathcad 00 under windows 00 in enhanced mode with a 0mb ram drive 0mb0mb smart drive and no swap file permanent or temporary for several months  i am interested in the faster mathcad 00 but i am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of mathsofts claim about increased speed  to 000sx users    will mathcad 00 run without a swap file or insist that i use a swap file  so far in response to a less detailed description of my setup or in unrelated postings the more informed answers on the net or by email appear to be    0 by fuessllnlgov david a fuess       according to mathsoft no mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as     not to overburden the physical resources they say this is actually a     win00s feature a figure of 00mb was indicated to me as a minimum but     you might try anyway    0 by berttylersatalinkcom bert tyler       im not all that certain that mathcad is the culprit here         i have a 00000dx0 with 00mb of main memory less 0mb for a ramdisk and     a bit for a dos session that is opened as part of the startup process     which i have been running without any swapfile  when i installed the     win00s subsystem from the march beta of the nt sdk the win00s subsystem     itself demanded the presence of a swapfile  the only win00s program     ive run to date is the 00bit version of freecell that came with that     subsystem         i gave windows a small temporary swapfile im leery of files that must     remain in fixed locations on my hard disk and all seems well    0 by bcaececmuedu brian c anderson       what is win00  i upgraded to mathcad 00 and it installed a directory for     win00 under windowssystem   during the upgrade it told me that win00     was required    0 by case0000studenttcumnedu steven v case0      mathcad 00 makes use of the win00s libraries  youve probably    heard about win00s it is a 00bit windows library that provides    much of the windows nt functionality no support for threads and    multitasking and such but can be run under windows 00    0 by rhynetczardozchemappstateedu thomas c rhyne       i also have 00 mb of ram and indeed mathcad 00 insisted on a permanent     swapfile it would not run otherwise    0 by bishopbaeyerchemfsuedu greg bishop       0 mathcad absolutely requires 0mb ram with 00mb swap file or 0mb ram     with 0mb swap file  it will give you a not enough memory error if the     swap file is less than 0mb  it is a major resource hog  if you do not     load the symbolic processor or the smart math it takes about 0mb of ram     real or virtual just to load again due to the win00s libraries                                                                                   so it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on mathsofts    advertisement for 00 that you need a swap file possibly as big as 00mb     looks like i would just need an 0mb swap file and would need to choose or    can i between a faster permanent swap file or a slower temporary swap file                                                                                 apparently a win00 subsystem ships with mathcad 00  how much disk space      does this require                                                                                                                                             i also received these answers    0 by mfdjhuxaecnbguedu dale hample       if youve got 00 megs of ram why not configure 00megs as a ram disk for     mathcad  dos 0 permits different bootup configurations

alternate bootup      would provide windows with this swap file   some time back i remember a       discussion about the issues of using a ram drive to support a swap file       but i thought this involved slower  0mb systems                                                                                                            i have dos 00 but for various reasons have not yet done a full

which files from the installation disks are   required                                                                                                                                                        0 by wildaccessdigexcom wildstrom       presumeably you mean without a permanent swap file if windows needs a     swap file it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesnt exist     permanent is generally faster though i dont know why mathcad wouldnt     be happy with either typever 00 is and so should any program conforming     to the win specification                                                                                    so far 00mb has been enough ram to avoid the overhead of running any swap      file  i have been running mathcad 00 under windows 00 without one

  can anyone tell me how chicagowindows 0 would differ from os0 0x  believe it or not im not trying to start a flame war here   im simply curious  if there is going to be any feature advantage in either of these products i do not consider the fact that it has uncle bills seal of approval much of a feature  one difference will probably be the same difference as between os0 and windows 0x nowone will likely have a lot of software available for it and one wont emulation with the inevitable incompatibilities that crop up in spite of all the contrary claims just doesnt count when you have to use a certain software package that doesnt quite run properly under the emulation developers want to channel their resources toward a platform that has a large installed base and in a case like that the platform that is most successfully marketed regardless of its relative sophistication will win  lamont downs downsnevadaedu  
  so good that there isnt any diff whether or not atmanager is turned on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technologies  and tt  there are some fonts that are only available as ps fonts  if you have a ps font that you want to use use atm  otherwise it is a waste of system resources  or if you need to use a service bureau and theyre only set up to use type 0 fonts from what ive heard pure hearsay the results of outputting tt fonts as type 0 is not as good as using highquality type 0 fonts in the first place  lamont downs downsnevadaedu

     brad banko writes while running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows 00  this evening i got a program has violated system integrity close all  applications exit windows and restart your computer error  gawd i love windows   0  is there an easy way to restore everything to working order what might be some better approaches  youll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh  data files should be examined and repaired  0  what might have caused this  does the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable  im suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing  youre not stupid  smartdrive caches things and windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also  all of this is pretty risky stuff in a pc environment  the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to  fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things  a reasonably accurate prediction   heres a brief description of how dos stores files  there are three pieces to a file  the directory entry the fat chain and the data area  you can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of 0x0 cards  the directory entry notebook paper holds the file name actual size and first cluster number  it also holds some other information thats not important right now  the file allocation table fat chain graph paper tells where to find the actual data  each square of graph paper holds a number  if the number is zero the cluster associated with this box is available  if it holds a magic number it is either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk  any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file  the data area 0x0 cards is where the actual information is stored the data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size storage is doled out in chunks of one cluster each  in your case one cluster is 0000 bytes  as a cluster is filled another is allocated  to read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number  now you read the data from that cluster next look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read  this will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file naturally these numbers are usually sequential but they can jump around and even go backwards  continue reading one cluster at a time as you walk this chain through the fat until you hit the marker which says its the last cluster in the file  chkdsk is the dos utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the fat and can bludgeon most flaws into submission  it doesnt have any intelligence so you have to doublecheck anything it fixes  now lets do a bit of a postmortem  cgfxvpic00cvpicexe cgfxvpic00vpictxt cgfxvpic00video0cfg cgfxvpic00orcpro0cfg cgfxvpic00vgacfg cgamegoosebird0x cwinmiscadv00winadvexe    allocation error size adjusted  all of these files have sizes according to the fat which dont match the size reported in their directory entries  chkdsk f will alter the directory entries to match the fat size  in other words   the directory entry for cvpicexe may say the file is 00000 bytes long but chkdsk found a fat chain of 00 clusters attached to it  my numbers obviously are made up     000 lost allocation units found in 000 chains     000000 bytes disk space would be freed  disk space was found which is allocated in the fat but is not attached to any directory entry  chkdsk f gives you the option of converting these lost chains to files  you can then examine the files file0000chk through file0000chk and rename or discard them  or if you tell chkdsk not to convert them to files then those clusters will simply be marked available in the fat   cgfxvpic00cvpicexe    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000    c000spartpar    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000  these files are both referencing the same data cluster  obviously one of them at least must be wrong  its interesting to note that c000spartpar is your windows swap file  to fix this you should copy each crosslinked file to a new name this will fix the crosslink by giving the files unique data spaces now delete the crosslinked files  examine the copies and try to assemble them properly  good luck  hint  missing pieces are likely to be found in those lost chains at the top    00000000 bytes total disk space    0000000 bytes in 0 hidden files     000000 bytes in 00 directories   00000000 bytes in 0000 user files    0000000 bytes available on disk  your disk is pretty close to full  this may be the actual cause of the problem perhaps windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space  in any case the short summary is that something trashed your fat there are utilities that can mirror your fat and help repair damage after something like this but you have to run them before the problem occurs  sorry

   to those interested in the new ati ultra cards  i had posted some questions regarding the new ati ultra pro cards and had asked confirmation of some opinions  this message is a summary of the responses thanks to all of you that replied    0 the card does not work in a system with 00m ram  a the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only as far as i know  the vlb    and eisa version should have no problems   b im pretty sure from my experience that the isa version doesnt    work in systems with over 00m ram  there is supposed to be way    of switching the memory aperture feature off to prevent this    but apparently it doesnt work  i posted some help me messages    on the net and people indicated that the eisa card didnt have this    problem  c false  d the vlb card which i have allows you to set memory aperture over 00m    by using their configuration software  no messing with jumpers necessary     the 00m problem is probably valid only for isa cards    0 the card works in a 00m system with some switches     set but it is much slower  a again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 000m ram    eisa and vlb or 00 m isa  00m should not be a problem for you    b dunno  c depends on the bus yes if isa no if eisa or localbus    0 the card is interlaced in its 00bit truecolour modes  a nope  i can use 000x000 at 00hz 00bit and 000x000 at 00hz 00bit all    noninterlaced  b yes  according to pc magazine theyve tested a local bus version    that does 0000x000 in 00bit which may or may not be interlaced  c not for the pro sometimes for the plus     some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors this has nothing to     do with 00 bits  only with screen size note that for 00 bit color    and windows you must have 0 megs memory size calculations notwithstanding    0 the latest build 00 drivers still do not work in many     cases  a they arent perfect but are much improved  i dont recall the last time which    i had to leave mach 00 mode ati gup mode and switch to 0000 or vga mode due    to software incompatibility  b true  many people recommended going back to build 00 or 00  c they appear to be excellent but have a few bugs for example certain    graphs with dashed lines in mathcad 00 do not print correctly though they    do display ok on the screen they are about par for fancy cards     other accelerated cards also have bugs  d overall i like the card even if driver performance is somewhat less than    satisfactory  i am running the 0000000 00 color mode as that is all my    nt driver for october nt version seems to allow     i will say this that color performance is not quite as nice as a diamond    stealth vram but i have not been able to try out a lot of the options on    the old driver    0 this card is the fastest full colour card for the money  a its quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate   b yes  ill admit it was very very fast in 00bit mode which is what    i wanted to use it for  too bad it crashed in many different ways    every 00 minutes or so  c depends on many many things    0 this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread   a i like it  b well  pc magazine seems to think it is  c yes this appears to be true   d as to greatest thing since sliced bread i doubt it  better cards are    coming out  who knows maybe ati will come out with something faster yet    several reviews i read rated one pycon winjet card as a superior performer     at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers which pycon was     developing at that time  pc magazine about two months or so back     overall the card has a lot of potential but you have to be able to use it     that is the end of the questions these were the most discussed items in this group so i thought they needed confirmation for those of you not familiar with the card i have included a summary here from an ati ad since i dont have an graphics ultra yet  ati graphics ultra plus  accelerated 0000x000 at 00k colours  true colour000m at 000x000  multimedia video acceleration for indeo videorle and video 0 compressed   stretch full motion video windows to full size  fast vga  includes 0 button mouse isa versions only  antialiased fonts ed avail in 00 colour mode onlyi think  realtime pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop  around a 00 length card size  priced from 000 us  ati graphics ultra pro  everything in graphics ultra plus  faster performance with vrams  accelerated 0000x0000 at 000 colours 00hz noninterlaced  available in isa eisa and microchannel  priced from 000 us  ati technologies 000 0000000  i hope this summary can be of use to you  al  ps  i am not associated with ati technologies in any way other       than having used their previous ati ultra card for a few       years which i generally liked     alan walford     eos systems inc vancouverbc canada  tel 0000000000 aeweosvcrwimseybcca           or        uunetwimseybccaeosvcraew

  hi  my last question for the year  i have a mailorder noname notebook with 0 meg ram  i never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview but win00 and w0w00 constantly crash on me most commonly citing a memory parity error  the only thing i can do is turn off and reboot  my cmos ticks off  counts all the memory every startup and there is never a problem with this either  could it be a bug in my windows copy instead of the hardware  i remember having some disk error problems when installing it   is there any change i could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of this happening i think win vs win s produce different crashes but both crash frequently nonetheless  i know this is a pain but please answer by email because my home account doesnt have rn  and i will stop asking questions now  thank you chet pager  chetteructhpxuctacza

  ive pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because i have the same requirements you doand the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers dont accept mice at any but com0 and com0 using irq0 or irq0 unless you buy special drivers from someone who has themive talked to mouse systems who say their driver doesnt support other than com0 and com0 as above  but who claim to be releasing one that will soon  the other alternative seems to be possible but in one case prohibitively expensive ie 0 port card for 000 and in the other the authors of powerbbs for windows claim to have a 0 port serial card with buffered 00000 uarts and drivers for windows to match ie com0 irq0 for 000  the second paragraph is hearsay because i havent checked it out yetbut intend to as soon as i can free up 000 g  hope this will save you some steps   
   ive been reading with much confusion about whether or not to use atmanager lately all the packages ive been buying have all included atmanager as a bonus i do some desktop publishing using pagemaker and coreldraw coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over 000 diff types add that to the ttfonts that come with win00 and you have a decent amount of fonts i print my creations out on an hp0 postcript at 000 dpi resolution with the resolution enhancement  technology and   well  i get some darn good copies  so good that there isnt any diff whether or not atmanager is turned on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technologies  and tt  atm will do nothing for your truetype fonts  if your truetype fonts are sufficient for your needs dont run atm  i have a lot of fonts that i can install either as type0 postscript under atm or as truetype  i have noticed that      0truetype font files are at least 00 larger than their type0 equivalents  if you are using a disk compressor though be aware that truetype fonts will compress whereas type0 fonts will not they are encrypted      0with a 000 dpi laser printer the artificial bold version of a truetype font is indistingishable from the original forcing me to install the actual bold and bolditalic etc variants if i want to use them  type0 postscript fonts under atm generate a visually distinct bold variant from the base font  i realize that the artificial bold font that atm generates is aesthetically inferior to the handgenerated bold truetype variant but it is sufficient for my needs and not having to install bold variants saves me 00 on disk space uncompressed   bob nichols att bell laboratories rnicholsihlpmihattcom  
  i have several people sharing my machine and would like to set up separate environments under windows for each of them  is there some way of setting things up separate desktopsdirectories for each of them  ideally id like totally separate virtual machines  id be willing to settle for less and may end up having batch files that copy ini files around depending on who wants to use the machine  mark alas setupn doesnt work if you dont have a network

   trying to pin point a hardware problem with my disk maxtor 0000at  group files get corrupted on a regular basis only happens on this drive d had only one corrupt file in over a year and it was under the control of winword on c 00bit disk access and smartdrive are off  since installation of dblspace problem has turned from an annoyance to a reason for murder  are you using fastopen  if you are disable it  we had a lot of problems with fastopen corrupting weird things including the windows permanent swap file when we were using it   since the most frequent files corrupted are the grp files are these the last thing written to when exitting windows  indeed they are  advanced personal measure tells me they are accessed just before shelldll   also are there any pdshareware utilities available that do a more thorough job than dos 0 ndd 00 etc  dos 0 and  win 00 compatable  i really like spinrite and qa plus  tom paladinworldstdcom   
  greetings     ive had a bunch of problems with the 00x  opening a dos window on the desktop can occasionally result in the windows blowing up into a set of horizontal lines hashing the entire desktop  nothing can recover this  except to completely exit from windows  the other irritating problem is that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually scrolling as if a cr was printed without an lf  this seems only to happen to communications programs but i cant nail it down any further than that note though that the comms programs dont have to be communicating  even just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in these programs causes the problem        prior to the latest rev of word perfect for windows wpwin would sometimes blow up and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of the problem  ive still seen this but only once or twice with wpwin 00        dave zimmerman    my opinions are my own

  are there any workspace managers out there for windows 00  by a workspace manager i mean something like the hp apollo workstations have  multiple workspaces under x  there is a window at the bottom of the screen which allows you to select different workspaces it overcomes the problem of having stacks of windows open on the one screen  instead you can spread them amongst different workspaces which act like independent screens and you can flick between them thanks in advance

       so good that there isnt any diff whether or not atmanager is turned    on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these    better printer technologies  and tt        there are some fonts that are only available as ps fonts  if you    have a ps font that you want to use use atm  otherwise it is    a waste of system resources         or if you need to use a service bureau and theyre only set up to use    type 0 fonts from what ive heard pure hearsay the results of outputting    tt fonts as type 0 is not as good as using highquality type 0 fonts in    the first place  unless you print to file with the correct resolution set for the final output device image setter  a problem with tt fonts in windows is that they do get converted to t0 format ok and the hinting is even used while this is done but the resulting t0 fonts are not hinted  the result is that they will work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the ps file is generated but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution    so when you print to an attached ps printer with the ps driver set up for this printer results may be quite good  but if you take a ps file made for that printer and run it on a device of different resolution such as an image setter then the results may not be so good

   i have uploaded the most recent windows drivers for the cirrus gd0000  chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftpcicaindianaedu  file is 0000dr00zip theyre very recent i downloaded them from the  cirrus bbs 0000000000 last night if you are unable to get them there  email me and maybe i can upload them to some other sites as well   i have a local bus based card vl00 bitblaster from micron but i think  the drivers work with isa cards or at least includes drivers for them  i found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 00 version  improving my graphic winmarks v000 by about 0 million 000 to 000  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  cirruss part but i dont think so  from steve gibsons columnist for info world graphic card comparisons  also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadvzip i extracted the  following for the sake of comparison  wintach              winbn000wordsprshtcadpaintoverall steves system 00000 vlb ati graphics ultra pro  0000000 00000000000 0000  my system  000sx00 vlb vl00 bitblaster  000 000 000000000000 0000   its no viper but i think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of  the ati card and when compared to the other cards included in gibsons review  micron system owners i would be interested to hear your opinions on the  dtc 0000vl local bus disk controller my system came with a maxtor 0000  drive 000 mb and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 00 kbs  i am now at 00 kbs is this about as good as it gets i cant get a nortons sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls at  least that was what the program said   oliver weatherbee oliverearthview  
    
  the deskjet is slow  this is in comparison to the other printers i mentioned  i have no idea how the bubblejet compares  the interface between win00 and the printer is just dandy ive not had any problems with it  i just bought a bj000 printer a couple of days ago  i compared it to the  sample print of an hp deskjet 000 and knew that the hp wasnt for me  the  bj000 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality  i can compare it  with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical  depending on the kind of paper  i dont have problems with the ink not  being dry it seems to dry very fast  probably within a second  since  canon is giving a 00 rebate until the end of may it is really a good buy    sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications  d000 hfac brigham young university provo ut  00000 0000000000  hfaccsrbyuedu ecktonsucsbyuedu

  i am using dos quick c 00 in a dos window under windows 00 and the other day while i was running the compiler i got a general protection fault immediately followed by a serious disk error  when i rebooted i found that about 00 files had gotten crosslinked which is a pretty serious corruption of the hard drive file system  i am concerned that quick c in a dos window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrvexe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem  i thought that dos programs run in dos windows were pretty wellcontained  by windows  if that is true then maybe the quick c compiler has nothing  to do with it  has anybody else had this type of problem  i only recently upgraded from quick c 00 to 00  brad banko     brad banko  dept of physics  u of illinois  bbankouiucedu  see one  do one  teach one00 de kb0cne  n0lnqil  
   btw how would you rate the new borland turbo c visual edition for windows anyone  time for a new discussion maybe  i asked in these groups some time ago what about the tcve and got no answers so i decided to try my brother who lives in the us bought and sent it to me and im still trying to get used to it  before i put my goodbad points list consider i am a turbo pascaldos programmer and sometimes try to make something in unix with c just some exercises from university i used to make some programs in microsoft c version 0  because we used some thirdparty libraries that required that   i like borland it seems to me much more easier to use than microsoft   specially the debugger i tried to learn codeview sometimes but never   felt confortable with it  tc ve seems very nice to create simple apps like the examples on the   objectwindows book so far no problems lets see next week or so when i   will try something more complex  it works nice even in my weak machine 00000mhz 0 mb ram   but   the manual for the resource workshop seems to be from a different version    from the workshop itself some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual  i think i will run into trouble since i got this tcve from my brother   as a present i didnt wanted to buy the japanese version because 0 i    suspect that the manuals will be in japanese  and 0 i believe it   will be far more expensive here so he bought it as a present and sent to   me i send the registration card to the japanese branch of borland but   who knows  so id like to ask some questions for you all   i know that there are some microsoft guys around here in this group is   there anybody from borland  is there any email address that we can    contact the technical support  not for stupid questions but to ask   for example why the rw manual seems to be different from the rw itself   is there anybody else using it around here   will the book of petzold be useful for me  i intend to use rw and protogen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself   answers to my email or composmswindowsprogrammertools please  thanks in advance  rafael

  thanks to all those people who recommended workspace managers for windows 00  i found 0 shareware workspace managers from australias mswindows archive monu0ccmonasheduau which mirrors some sites in the us  the three i found were  0 workspaces 000 wspacezip                                 this was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that i found  it is very easy to use    it displays a small window containing 0 buttons plus an extra    button for configuration purposes  one annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run  you must press    a key not a mouse button for the thing to go away  also it would    have been nice if there was an always on top setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons  maybe some userspecified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature  the simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package  0 workshift 00 wrksft00zip                                while this workspace manager offered a    few features that workspaces 000 lacked it was quite time consuming    to set things up  with workspaces 000 all but the first workspace    is initially empty  with workshift 00 you need to take snapshots    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like  ie what     applications they contain  also the main window is quite large    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace    with workspaces 000 there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it  workshift 00 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful  0 bigdesk 000 and backmenu backdeskzip                             this is an interesting package which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager  other goodies    include backmenu which provides a popup root menu when you    press a certain mouse button  just like in xwindows  the menu    is totally configurable offering unlimited depth of cascading menus    which is provides quite handy access to applications  you could    say it is a menubased alternative to the program manager  also    bundled in backdeskzip is a program called wrun which allows    you to run windows applications from a dos shell under windows    instead of using the file manager to run applications      the actual workspace manager is called bigdesk 000  bigdesk works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesnt provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces    in fact it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on  this means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one  the bigdesk control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop  basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blowup    of a particular section  try each of them out for yourself  i was impressed with all of them so find out which one suits your needs the best

  a while ago i installed spss for windows as part of an evaluation once the evaluation was complete i duly deleted the software from my pc  unfortunately there is still a ghost of spss left when i run something like write and go to embed an object then spss chart appears on the list of objects im offered i looked around all the obvious ini files without success the next thing i tried was looking for the string spss chart in every file in the  windows directory it turned up in a file called reqdat or regdat unfortunately the file was binary and so i didnt feel inclined to edit it  id welcome a solution for removing spss from the list of ole servers  chris wooff cwooffliverpoolacuk

  program manager but it seems that everytime i install something new that makes a new group it promptly disappears after i turn of windows  0 did you check that a new grp file was actually created in your windows     directory 0 are you turning off your computer when windows is running rather than     closing program manager     ekkehard

   i have a bat file that i run under a windows icon  i have set up a pif file to run the bat file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen the first line of the bat file sets an environment variable  my problem is that on some of our machines running msdos 00 and windows 00 in enhanced mode the set command in the bat file fails with the out of environment space error  i have raised the amount of environment space to 0000 bytes using the shell command in configsys so i know that i am nowhere near to running out   from the windows resource toolkit for win0workgroups add an entry to your systemini file under the nonwindowsapp section      commandenvsizennnn  this sets the commandcom env size where nnnn must either be 0 or between 000 and 00000  a value of 0 disables the setting  if this value is too small or too big it is rounded up to 000 or down to 00000 if the value is less than the current size of the actual environment this setting is disabled as if it were 0  if you specify the environment size in a pif file for commandcom the pif setting overrides this setting  the default is 0 with msdos versions earlier than 00  otherwise the default value is the e option in the shell command in configsys  to set this value you must edit your systemini and reboot   i have used this entry as well as relied on the default e from the configsys shell line and both give larger environments  if you dont use one of these then the environment passed by windows to each new dos box is just a little bit bigger than the environment variables present when windows was started  no matter how big the dos env was when windows starts it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes  this should allow your batch file to run but your mileage may vary   jerome jerry schneider             domain jlsatgcom  aspen technology group               uucp   uunetcsnatglabjls po box 000 ft collins co 00000    voice  000 0000000

  from kaymancsdd0stanfordedu robert kayman subject canon bj000 bubblejet and hp deskjet 000 keywords printer date 00 apr 00 000000 gmt   hello fellow netters  i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj000 bubblejet vs the hp deskjet 000  i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential  and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson  now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 000 dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlettpackard deskjet 000 000 dpi which is faster  is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics  which will handle large documents better 00 pages or more  any personal experience on either will be appreciated here  which works better under windows 00 any driver problems etc cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc  basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and bad  advance kudos and thanks for all your input  email or news posting is readily acceptable but email is encouraged limits bandwidth   sincerely  robert kayman       kaymancsstanfordedu  or  cpacsstanfordedu  in theory theory and practice are the same  in practice they are not you mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision  revised   all right  not saying i know any more than the average salesguy ill give  your question a shot   the key issue that i bought my bj000 on was ink drying speed  you really  have to try awful hard to get the bj000 ink to smear  the hp deskjets need  0000 seconds to completely dry  in both cases however do not get your  pages wet  unlike laser printers the material on your pages is ink not  toner  but that should go without saying  my pc has very little memory only 0meg ram so the bj000 takes a little  while to print  but every application i use takes a while to run  once  the computer is solely printing it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 0000 seconds depending on how detailed your graphics are    the bj000 can do windows soft fonts  im assuming that the deskjet can or  hp wouldnt sell many  size is another factor  the bj000 is much smaller but the hp is built  like a tank  i bet the bj000 would get damaged first  finally the print quality  i love the bj000s resolution  it looks like  a good laser quality print  the hps ive usedthey look like ink  not  as impressive    so i chose the canon  any other opinions

  i would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few  questions about windows for workgroups  i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver 00 i am considering moving all our machines to w0wg  q0  how much conventional ram does w0wg use over and above the      driver for the network card  i have just checked it and you have three files that are loaded protman   000 bytes driver 0000 bytes workgrp 0000 bytes  q0  if i have a novell ne0000 card are the lsl and ipx drivers      still needed  no w0wg uses its own drivers  q0  does w0wg do a license check over the network to ensure each      machine is running its own licenced copy of w0wg note i do      not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy      of w0wg for each of our machines it is just that i would like      to try it out first to see if it meets our needs returning one      opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies  not that i know of i bought two copies had some problems with one installed both from the same copie no problems do worry i just had a really old bios and thats the only problem i got  q0  if you buy the upgrade to windows 00 for w0wg does it replace      all of win 00 as you install it or does it depend on current      win 00 files it will replace all older files i think and prompt you for the others  q0  if i install windows nt on my server when it comes out will i have      any troubles with the w0wg machines  this i do not know  when i started this message i was going to ask only 0 questions but i got carried away ill stop now   i look forward to your replies  al   hope this helps  gel

   in a previous article mrw00000engnxt00csouiucedu michael r whitchurch says  whenever i start file manager the status bar is not displayed even though it is selected in the options menu if i deselect it then select it again the bar appears anyone have any ideas why this is happening  no not really it may be that your winfileini has gotten corrupted for some unknown reason have you tried recreating it by either 0exiting filemanager with the save setting option on when the status bar is visible or 0double clicking on the control menuthe one with minimize and maximize in in when everything looks proper  if you have and it still doesnt work you may want to delete your winfileini and try one of these two saving procedures again to totally recreate the file from scratch  good luck  mark waschkowski    
  thomasdfellrath0ndedundedu wrote   the key issue that i bought my bj000 on was ink drying speed  you really   have to try awful hard to get the bj000 ink to smear  the hp deskjets need   0000 seconds to completely dry  in both cases however do not get your   pages wet  unlike laser printers the material on your pages is ink not   toner  but that should go without saying  i think the ink now used in the deskjet family is waterfast

  a while ago i installed spss for windows as part of an evaluation once the evaluation was complete i duly deleted the software from my pc  unfortunately there is still a ghost of spss left when i run something like write and go to embed an object then spss chart appears on the list of objects im offered i looked around all the obvious ini files without success the next thing i tried was looking for the string spss chart in every file in the  windows directory it turned up in a file called reqdat or regdat unfortunately the file was binary and so i didnt feel inclined to edit it  id welcome a solution for removing spss from the list of ole servers  i think you can do this with regedit which can make changes to the ole registration database  from program manager or  file manager choose run and type regedit  you do have it its included with windows but not well documented  tom paladinworldstdcom

  ok i have a 000dx00isa w diamond stealth vram 0mb i was really satisfied w its performance in windows but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in dos vga especially this new strike commander  this stealth vram can only give me 000 fps  i use 0dbench my winmark was 000 million i think  so right now im considering to replace it w a new card which hopefully can perform approx same w my current vram in windows and also can perform dos vga preferably 00fps  i also saw the 0dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it in csipg and it looked that speedstar 00x and orchid prodesigner 0ds ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard both can give 00fps in dos vga w 000dx000 does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor type  which one is the worthiestnot necessarily fastest any other card recommendation is welcomed too  also if possible where can i get this card for the cheapest   thanks in advance folks  martin

  a couple of weeks ago i posted a question concerning communicating between vb and msaccess using dde the answers i received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working however during this process i have come up with new problems  0 there seems to be a limit of 000 characters for a dde topic string is this inherent in all dde systems or just peculiar to msaccess or vb  0 it is easy to query an access database from vb using the dde sql command provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names but how is one meant to update a database    a a dde sql update command does not seem to work    b initiating an access macro using a dde execute command from vb cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from vb using a       second dde channel the programs dead lock until time outs occur       the vb to access channel has to close before the access to vb channel       is initiated i guess    c access does not allow vb to dde poke the information      the way i eventually managed to update a database was by sending key    strokes from vb to access using the sendkeys command this technique has    the problem that access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of keystrokes vb sends  are all the above statements correct or have i made incorrect assumptions are there any better work arounds to the above are there any signs of an odbc driver for access  bob randocicacuk

   ok i have a 000dx00isa w diamond stealth vram 0mb  i was really satisfied w its performance in windows  but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in dos vga  especially this new strike commander   this stealth vram can only give me 000 fps  i use 0dbench  my winmark was 000 million i think    so right now im considering to replace it w a new card which hopefully  can perform approx same w my current vram in windows and also  can perform dos vga preferably 00fps    i am ordering the actix graphicsengine ultra plus it is the same price as the stealth card plus it is also based on s0 000 chip the newest and fastest chip from s0  everyone if you are looking for a card see the april issue of pc magazine for their review   they noted this persons problem with dos the stealth card is not a very good dos performer the actix card is rated the best in this chip class non local bus it got glowing reports from the magazine was a best buy and i called them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week they have a bulletin board to get the latest drivers  though somone posted that this bbs was at 0000   at any rate the actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards in the 000 class based on the winmark results  if you are looking for the all around best doswindows performance  check out the actix card their 0000 number is 0000000  ps the article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user ie games then you should also check out the 000 chip from s0 it apparently scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 000 chip ie stealth and actix cards they have comparable windows performance and are cheaper to buy  eric

   to clarify    vc is considered an upgrade for c0  there will be no product called c 00 although the commandline compiler of vc lists its version as 000  c0 is not a dosonly product  it is a cc compiler capable of producing executables for dos or windows as is vc pro ed  the significant difference is that vc comes with many windowshosted tools ide etc which assist developers in creating windows executables much more quickly basically by automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code  initial impressions have been very favorable  everyone who is a registered user of c0 should have received a considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of c0 if you havent call microsoft and im sure theyd be happy to send you some  jefrem iwaniw pelican software corporation

  well im amazed at how successful this exercise was i received 00 responses and 0 requests for summary thanks to everyone who made it possible  on my own i was able to find out about codebase accsys and qe codebase and accsys are c libraries without sql qe is a windows application that can be communicated through windows dde calls where you send a sql string and receive the results  most people wrote to tell me about the paradox engine from borland other  products mentioned were microsofts odbc accsys quadbase codebase rbase and qe only odbc quadbase rbase and qe have sql  for myself i decided on codebase mostly because it has an ansi c portability version that runs under dos unix etc and includes the source code and portability is important in my application it works with dbase foxpro or clipper files  however i feel that microsofts odbc looks very promising its mostly a formalisation of building and submitting sql queries and formatting query results as the responses say its available via ftp except its effectively unusuable without two manuals the odbc programmers reference and the odbc sdk guide moreover odbc doesnt actually interpret sql and liase with databases thats  up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers also its windows only its actually an extension to the windows sdk  nevertheless its a start at a sql interface standard and should make life interesting in the future  heres my original post followed by the responses separated by  a line of asterisks    does anyone know if borland or microsoft have libraries for accessing  their respective databases paradox foxpro from within c programs  id really like to be able to build a sql query string and pass it  to a function which returns the query results in some format failing  that any other access would still be better than nothing    id also like to hear of third party libraries for doing the same thing    if other people are interested ill prepare a summary of what im  told and post it    thanks to all    borland has a product called paradox engine that does just what you want  the current version is 00 which is fully compatible with ack paradox 00  why the versions are different i dont know pd engine 00 was compatible with pdox 00 and 00  it consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both pascal i think turbo pascal 00 and up and c i think either microsoft or borland  now reading the box its borland paradox engine  database frameworks  works with any borland cc mocrosoft c 000 or later turbo c for windows turbo pascal 00 or later tp for windows 00 or later  for framework applications bc 00 or later or ms cc 00 it does have support for object useage  i havent had a real chance to really use it myself but it looks fairly complete im planning to use it this summer rick      rick osterberg   osterberhuscharvardedu  0000000000  0000000000        0000 harvard yard mail center   cambridge ma   000000000   usa          borland has a product which is called paradox engine  i do not know about ms  the paradox engine i know very well and it definitiely not a replacement for sql but it will enable you to save

into the public domain its  big i believe 00 mb but worth downloading over a  fast link look at ftpuunet in vendormicrosoftodbcsdk   also some companies are starting to provide sql engines i  just got one for rbase not exactly cheap at 000 but it  allows programs in c or vbasic under dos or windows to talk  to data bases using sql functions in your code   hth   walter knopf  fermilab

engine    earl roethke eroethkeemscdccom     i actualy have paradox engine  it is a library of functions large model for accessing the paradoxs databases  it seems to be working fine but i never did try it thouroughly  it costs 000  hope it will help you      borland provides a database lib called paradox engine which can access and use the database files aswell as many other things  gary

computing caulfield campus monash university australia             paradox engine is the library  for paradox    artur babecki arturiiujedupl    borland sells the paradox engine  which has all the paradox calls in it its hardly sql though  you can do searches on key fields and on  indivual fields but no comparison operators like    so its pretty painful in my opinion do do anything besides simple retrieval and insertsupdates  im currently using it i have an eval copy and ive linked it in to some entry screens ive written  the engine library adds about 000k to the size of the program but you can load it as an overlay using borlands vroom manager  now borland claims that later versions of the engine will have sql support but they dont really expect it till late in the year or even next year they are trying to get thrid parties to help out  if you have any other questions  let me know  mike kamlet mikevpnetchiilus     yes borland sells their paradox engine separately  it has c c and pascal interfaces although the underlying interface is in c well at least for version 00 of the engine which i have costed 00 at egghead they now have version 00 of the engine and a separate c class package for it     michael d kersenbrock adc kentrox  portland oregon michaelkkentroxcom uunetkentroxmichaelk     ive used accsys for paradox new version is almost ready for paradox 00 to access paradox files from c  its pretty good  not sql though  have heard of borland paradox engine or some such which is supposed to do likewise but not sure of what it is exactly  hope this helps good luck chris     borland sells their paradox engine 00  its a library of functions for accessing paradox db files  it comes with libraries for ms c 00 bcc 00 turbo pascal v and i believe it comes with turbo pascalwin libraries as well the c libraries come in both dos and windows flavors the win stuff  being dlls    when i got it it also came with crystal reports which is a graphical report generator  it allows you to create a generic form and use it within a compiled program using pdox engine  i dont know if they still offer it or what the current price is i paid  something like 0000 for an upgrade from the earlier version though  hope this helps  david taylor         the commander     it is easier to change the  internet gt0000cprismgatechedu specification to fit the program     also

                             tom delosh      borland has the paradox engine library  it has libraries for both c and pascal to access paradox files under doswindows   but for paradox i believe youd have buy have the sql link  since pdox itself isnt sql compliant  ive used the engine  for over a year now and have been pretty satisfied with it   under dos its a real pig  it tacks on about 000k to the size of  your programs  tim ma associate programmer university of utah email  timsrccppautahedu    i dont know about microsoft but borland sells the paradox engine for cc  pascal in one package  and if you want dbase compatible files there is a  library called codebase from sequiter software that works with cc       were using qe database libraries to do what you describe its a set of dlls accessed through a common api to talk to most of the major database formats were using it to build an application that queries several databases using sql queries all access using qe is done using sql the package is available through microway in melbourne i believe it is produced by pioneer systems in the us we have no association with microway or pioneer systems other than being satisfied

seems that it supports  only borlandturbo c and microsoft c when i tried to compile  the engines sample applications with the waterloo watcom cc 00bit compiler it complains that the library file llibcelib  is missing even though i am quite certain that the file is not part of watcom c or the engine anybody have any success with  other c compilers  ronknghydroonca      im currently developing an app with borlands paradox engine for c it also comes in pascal which has recently gone to version 00 ie px engine 00 is compatible with paradox 00 and downward compat w00  there are indeed c libs for fox access but i cant think of the names offhand  im sure someone has already written you in that regard  i think i just saw an add for a fox lib in the c users journal which is a good place to look for this type of package in general by the way ive been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of px eng over the past year  wouldnt recommend it for a complex multiuser appbut im staying with it for nowits like a bad marriage ive got too much time invested in learning and workarounds  but if your interest is limited to a simple singleuser interface you want to build your own sql engine i take it px engine will do the job easily  it doesnt sound like youll be bumping into any of the gotchas  if you do write me i may be able to point you in the right direction     borland has a paradox engine and database framework 00 which gives you a c and assembler api to paradox databases  this is part of boca  borlands object component architecture  they have technical briefs on boca

  cant guarantee that itll work for everyone but i finally fixed my mouse jumpiness problems i installed a bus mouse sorry i didnt say the solution was free in the past id tried everything with my microsoft serial mouse cleaning it unloading all kinds of tsrs turning off smartdrv write cacheing changing com ports  nothing worked yesterday i finally broke down and bought a mouse systems bus mouse the improvement is even better than i had imagined so much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy all the time i just thought it was jumpy sometimes and i had gotten so used to it i didnt notice my wife who uses the computer about once a month noticed the improvement literally within a second  i cant say anything about other bus mice but with the mouse systems one youll have to give up either com0 or lpt0 to an irq also if you dont know mouse systems mice have three buttons the driver includes a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button  hope this helps someone else if youre anywhere near as frustrated as i was its well worth the 00    stephen thomas   att tridom   0000000000 email satengtridomcom attmailtridomsat

   hi all  i have a dll in which i register a class and create a window of that class type  both calls require a module instance handle hinstance  petzolds 00 book says that it is best to use the module instance handle of the calling program not the module instance handle of the dll page 000  i have two questions  0  is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module  0  what are the possible problems with using the instance handle of     the dll  thanks in advance mike        mike smith                          email  msmithma00bullcom     bull hn information systems inc     phone  000 0000000     000 concord road  ma00  000a          fax  000 0000000     billerica ma 00000  usa    
   due to the resolution and size it is in 00 parts  this is a uuencoded bitmap  000x000 000 colors the picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background the size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 0000x000 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture reguarding image quality and resolution  i have not seen much better  for those of you who havent worked with pieced image files here is how to put it back together 0 save the 00 parts to 00 individual files 0 use a text editor to remove the header and footer    in each file 0 concatinate all the parts into a single file 0 uudecode the file there are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert unix and uucoder windows  if neccesary i could post these tools or where to get them by ftp  let me know  part 0 of 00  begin 000 romanbmp m0dts0hp0h0ldx0ge000u00 mhtta00uk000qly0y000rljjunpui0d0e0d0

  this is the official request for discussion rfd for the creation of two new newsgroups for microsoft windows nt  this is a second rfd replacing the one originally posted in january 00 and never taken to a vote  the proposed groups are described below  name  composmswindowsntsetup status  unmoderated purpose discussions about setting up and installing windows nt and about  system and peripheral compatability issues for windows nt  name composmswindowsntmisc status unmoderated purpose miscellaneous nonprogramming discussions about using windows nt  including issues such as security networking features console  mode and windows 00 win00 compatability  rationale microsoft nt is the newest member of the microsoft windows family of operating systems or operating environments for those who wish to argue about the meaning of an os  the family ranges from modular windows through windows 00 and windows for workgroups to windows nt at the high end  to date microsoft has shipped over 00000 beta copies and prerelease sdks of windows nt  the actual release is slated for mayjune 00  while windows nt has an entirely new design internally it shares an application programming interface with the other members of the windows family its win00 api includes the win00 api used in win dows 00 and the win00s api subset win00 less threads networking and security can be used to create 00bit applications for windows 00  the user interface is also practically identical to that of windows 00 with the addition of logins and a few other features  it uses program manager file manager and other applets and generally pre sents an identical appearance to the user  many of the announced windows nt applications are ports of existing windows 00 apps and nt also runs existing 00 applications  thus it appears logical that windows nt should share the following groups with the other members of the windows family composmswindowsapps composmswindowsprogrammertools composmswindowsprogrammermisc composmswindowsprogrammerwin00  the following groups are also clearly applicable to windows nt as well as windows 00 composmswindowsannounce composmswindowsadvocacy  in conclusion the only clear argument for the separation of the windows 00 and windows nt hierarchies is different internal structures of windows 00 and windows nt  and yet operating systems such as os0 macintosh os xenix and coherent all have undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate newsgroup hierarchies  further windows 00 is due for a major rewrite itself in 0000  when the fully 00bit protectedmode and withdosbuiltin next generation windows chicago debuts next year surely it should remain in the same hierarchy  and what then would be the jus tification for separating windows nt from other windows versions   discussion period the discussion period will run from 00 april 0000 to 00 may 0000    voting the cfv call for votes will be issued around 00 may 0000 based on the feedback received during the discussion period  no votes will be accepted prior to the cfv    tom haapanen  tomhmetricscom  software metrics inc  waterloo ont         stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth  now pull            up  thats how the corrado makes you feel   car january 00

   i have been posting monthly howtosetup a slip client on a pc posts for a  few months  lots of work and imminent graduation have come in the way of  posting one of these for march or earlier this month  for which i apologize  this file includes information on writing a script for university of minnesota phone and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with  phone   for additions modifications and corrections i can be reached at ashokbiochemistrycwruedu  best wishes ashok   begin sliptxt  based on my experiences on setting up slip under dos and windows  here are my comments on setting up slip in this environment  i thank the trumpet beta testers and the cwru slip beta testers for their comments   configuring your modem  a turn off dtr atd0w    i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use    to dial my slip server qmodem drops dtr when i exit the program    and therefore hangs up the line  if you use a program like kermit    or conex to establish the slip connection then this need not be done    these programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit     note if you use univ of minn phone to dial and establish a          slip connection you do not need to turn off dtr  b dial and establish the slip connection first  this can be done    automatically if you use a program like phone from the university of    minnesota which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the    slip packet driver  the phone scripting language is simple and    phone scripts can be easily written to configure phone to work with    other slip server  in addition while the only packet driver    that phone works with is umslip currently it is easy to write a    batch file hack that lets phone work with other packet drivers    there is a section on phone in the document with both script and    batch file examples   configuring the slip drivers  there are five slip packet drivers commonly available cslipperexe    peter tattams compressed slip driver slipperexe     peter tattams slip driver slip0000com    crynwr driver i like phil burns modified driver etherslcom     crynwr driver ethernet simulation over slip umslipcom      univ of minnesota driver based on slip0000  of these four i vastly prefer cslipperexe over slip0000com or etherslcom for the following reasons  a it is much faster even though my modem has just a 00000 uart b while using etherslipslip0000umslip myself and several others    have noticed that the pc clock gets messed up after performing a    long ftp transfer c it supports pktmux when used in ethernet simulation mode d when used in ethernet simulation mode cslipper seem to work with    every tcpip application that i have tested it with  instructions for cslipperexe and you do not use phone a load slipper in your autoexecbat file according to instructions    for instance if you have a v00bis modem on com0    slipper com0 vec00 baud00000 b if you use dos tcpip applications in win 00 dos boxes then use the    doubleended packet driver shim winpktcom  this creates a virtual    packet driver at 0x00  dos applications in native mode dos    applications in windows 00 dos boxes and windows applications can all    use this virtual driver at 0x00    winpktcom 0x00 0x00 c if you use qvtnet load pktintcom next  qvtnet is configured in    qvtnetini to use the interrupt at 0x00    pktintcom  instructions for slip0000com a try getting a version 00 slip driver  philip burns of northwestern    university has a modified slip0000com driver that is better at hardware    handshaking  this driver is distributed along with nupop b load the driver after establishing the slip connection  my modem is a    v00bis modem on com0 so here is how i would load the driver    slip0000 w 0x00 h 0 slip 0x00f0 00000 c as discussed above if you use dos tcpip applications in windows 0x    dos boxes you probably want to use winpktcom    winpktcom 0x00 0x00 d if you use winqvtnet load pktintcom    pktintcom  instructions for etherslcom if you choose to use etherslcom instead of slip0000com the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference  you will have to delete the line devicevcd from the 000enh section of systemini  this will interfere with running regular windows comm applications such as crosstalk and you will get lots of dropped characters etc in these applications  this is therefore not recommended  etherslip would be loaded as    ethersl w 0x00 h 0 0x00f0 00000  configuring windows 00  a make the following modifications to the systemini file 000enh    section    i list all your com ports with their addresses and interrupts        com0base00f0        com0irq0        com0base00f0        com0irq0        com0base00e0        com0irq0        this can also be done from within windows  control panel        but doubleclicking on the ports icon    ii give the port to which your modem is attached a generous com buffer        com0buffer00000    iii change the com port autoassign value for the com port that you wish        to use for your modem to zero  this is the amount of time that        windows waits in seconds before handing control of that com port to        another application  if you use winqvtnet and then want to switch        from one session to another and this value is at the default value        of 0 seconds you are will get a gpf and windows will crash        com0autoassign0        this can also be done from within windows  control panel        doubleclick on 000 enhanced and under device contention set        the device contention for the com port your modem is on to        never warn  additional notes  what to do if you are assigned a different ip address for each slip session  i am fortunate in that our campus slip server assigns each user a permanent ip address so i do not have worry about editing qvtnetini each time that i establish a slip connection  if you are assigned a new ip address on every occasion that you dial in please try to use bootp aware software and let bootp do the configuration for you  however qvtnet is not bootp aware and rarp will not work over a slip connection  to get qvtnet working in a situation such as this you must do the following  edit the qvtnetini file  let the net section look like this  net name ip netmask0000000000 or whatever is appropriate for you arptime00 packetvector00 or whatever is appropriate  save the changes and then writeprotect this file attrib r qvtnetini  start your slip connection and remember the name and ip address that you are assigned  each time you start qvtnet 00x the general configuration dialog box will open  enter the name and ip address and you were assigned for that session click on ok and you should be up and running  the changes you make will not be saved as qvtnetini is writeprotected  a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip address assignment is provided by victor menayang victorccwfccutexasedu victor uses the program bootpq to semiautomate qvtnet preparation bootpq is used to inquire the assigned ip which is then saved to a file called myip  another file noip is essentially a complete qvtnetini file that lacks the ip address  in the final step myip and noip are copied into a single qvtnetini file  an example of victors batch file is provided below  slipper com0 pktintcom bootpq i ips   myip bootpq i my ip is s copy q net  myip  noip ecomqvtnetqvtnetini del q myip echo off echo  echo ready to run winqvtnet  for questions and more details about bootpq please contact victor menayang victorccwfccutexasedu  qpc software is attempting to add bootp capability to winqvtnet  how do you use pktmux over slip  pktmux will not work over the slip0000com packet driver and crashes immediately if used with etherslcom  pktmux will work with cslipperexe when cslipper is used in ethernet simulation mode  an example of this configuration is shown below  the latest release of pktmux is 00c and it is important that you use this version if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like trumpet for windows to be released very shortly  from autoexecbat  lh cslipper com0 vec00 baud00000 ether         packet driver lh pktmux 0 00 0       pktmux loaded for 0 virtual packet drivers lh pktdrv 0f 00         first virtual packet driver used for qvtnet lh pktintcom           qvtnet pktintcom pktdrv 00 00            pktdrv for use in native dos or wintrumpet  additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within windows 00 dos boxes  for example my pif file to load popmail is directed to the file popmailbat  this is what popmailbat reads like  pktdrv 00 00            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x00 cd popmail popmail cd  pktdrv 00 u            unloads the packet driver at 0x00 exit                    causes the dos window to close  i have similar batch files that load other dos tcpip applications like pc gopher  it is my experience that pktmux works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual dos sessions are loaded at the same software interrupt  for example within two different dos boxes  one for popmail and the other for gopher the virtual packet driver pktdrv is loaded at 0x00 in each instance  how much does pktmux degrade the performance of cslipper  i have a v00bisv00bis modem in a 00000 running windows 00 with a reasonably fast video card ati graphics ultra  under these conditions when i have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows a driver at 0x0f  qvtnet ftp client session b driver at 0x00 in one dos window  cutcp tn0000 session c driver at 0x00 in another dos window  trumpet for dos  i get ftp transfer rates of 00  00 kbsec while transferring compressed files  this rate is comparable to that which i get with slip0000 loaded as a packet driver and where a single tcpip session is active  if cslipper is used a packet driver and a single session is active i get transfer rates of 00  00 kbsec on the same files  while there is about 00 degradation in the performance of slipper for me the benefits of being able to use pktmux outweigh the performance hit  cslipper and ethernet simulation mode  in ethernet simulation mode cslipper ver 00 works with all the applications that i have tested it with  one or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at cslipper 00 but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver 00  when slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode and used with pktmux i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that reads ipincorrect packet type or ipbad version number  this does not seem to prevent qvtnet from functioning although i cannot comment on loss of performance  what can you do if your dos tcpip application does not work with cslipper in ethernet simulation mode  in the rare event that you find a package that does not work with cslipper in ethernet simulation mode first contact the author  peter tattam  peterpsychnetpsycholutaseduau and let him know  chances are that he can fix it  in the meanwhile you can try the following  i do not know if it is kosher but it worked when i had problems with cslipper ver 00  cslipper is loaded at 0x00 as described above under the pktmux section  i load etherslcom at 0x00 run the application and then terminate etherslcom  this also works within windows 00 virtual dos boxes  however a packet driver like ethersl can be used in only one virtual dos box at a time  so for example here is my batch file to run grateful med a medical reference retrieval program developed at the national library of medicine  ethersl w 0x00 h 0 0x00f0 00000       loads etherslip cd gm0 search cd  termin 0x00                             terminates etherslip exit            closes the dos box and returns me to windows  if you use this method be cautious about one thing  dont have any active pktmux dos sessions open at the same time  after closing the ethersl window you can run your pktmux dos sessions with no problem  btw the example above  grateful med works with no problems with cslipper ver 00  phone script files  the documentation that accompany phone provide good instructions on writing script files to get phone to dial slip servers other than the university of minnesota server  for example here is a script that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend  background  to start a slip connection i dial our terminal server and login with a username and password  after doing so i start a slip session with the following command slip usernameslipdialincwruedu followed by my password  again  here then is the relevant portion of the phonecmd script file    cwruts0 slip login script by ashok aiyar 00000  last

the quick answer  there is no clean way  below is a batch file hack that i wrote to use phone with other packet drivers  in this example the packet driver is peter tattams cslipper  to use a batch file like this you must know the parameters with which you plan to use the packet driver  ie interrupt vector baud rate port address and irq  this batch file requires umslipcom cslipperexe and termincom to be in the same directory or in your path   all that the batch file does is to let you dial the slip connection using phone load the appropriate packet driver hangup the connection and unload the driver when you are done    being cwruslipbat  echo off rem   this batch file is an ugly hack of u of minn slipbat rem   awaiting a version of cslipper that can directly interact rem   with

          i am having something very unusual happen  first  some background on my system  i have a mitsubishi 00 meg hard drive  and am running smartdrv the version that comes with windows 00 on  it  i rarely use windows  i use a program called disk technician  gold v000 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive  it works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file or if there is anything else is wrong with it  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting  my hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors  i usually end up with 0 new bad  sectors a week           heres what happened  i ran a program and dtg broke in with  an emergency warning and recommended i reboot  it gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded  i exited the program  and did just this  dtg went through its bootup process examining  for new errors etc and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time           i then went back to the program executed it again and the  exact same error was detected  i rebooted and tried again and the  same error happened again  so i removed dtg from memory and went  to the program to see if i could detect anything wrong  sure enough  there was a number of read attempts  so i rebooted and reloaded dtg  but removed the cache  i executed the program  no read errors  either audible or detected by dtg  i quit the program loaded the  cache and ran the program again  the errors were detected           ok so the errors are there and dtg detects but doesnt fix  them when the cache is loaded  when the cache is not loaded there are  no errors  so to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files i went into xtree gold and tagged all files and searched them  for a random string in other words i wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive  before i got through  the cs dtg had detected at least six errors and recommended i reboot           does anybody have any idea why smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive  oh there are exactly two misreads per file and 0 in  about every 000 files are affected             i originally posted this message to disk technician corps  system but i figured someone out in netland may know enough about  smartdrv to help me out                       internet  jdrivernetlinkctscom john driver uucp   ryptydenetlinkjdriver netlink online communications  public access in san diego ca 000 0000000

   word 00c doesnt show the periodcentred character to indicate spaces if i use the ttfonts from coreldraw  our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box  they overlap each other and characters on each side which is useless  i believe the character used by w0w is the periodcentred 0000 this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this  i have edited the corel font with fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0000 character makes no difference to the font output in charmap or w0w altering the paragraph 0000 or cedilla 0000 does alter their font graphics displayed however  is the w0w character used to indicate spaces the periodcentred character   has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a coreldraw ttf                                                                              russ sharp    russdeakineduau    ph 00000 0000    fax 00000 0000     deakin university school of engineering  technology geelong australia

   hello again  about a week and onehalf ago i posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers  specifically a comparison between the canon bj000 bubblejet and the hewlettpackard deskjet 000  many people asked me to post the summaryaccount of all the postings and email i received  below is my original query and the responses i received  i have not deleted any part of the responses only the headers and signatures so you can extract what you find necessary  some people asked me for an unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer  there are a wide range of comments each has its own value    there was no clear winner some like the bj000 especially its priceperformance ratio others preferred the durability and reliability of the deskjet the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background  two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention a new printer to be introduced by hewlettpackard later this year around summertime and an addition to the epson product line their first inkjet  you will find that after the initial purchase the costs of refilling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same this largely depends on where you purchase the refills or replacements  so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer  no one mentioned approx how many sheets each ink cartridge will print but i suspect they are roughly equal at about 0000  0000 sheets laser printers will do 00000000 sheets per toner cartridge  well thats a brief research summary of my personal research  enjoy    hello fellow netters  i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj000 bubblejet vs the hp deskjet 000  i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential  and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson  now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 000 dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlettpackard deskjet 000 000 dpi which is faster  is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics  which will handle large documents better 00 pages or more  any personal experience on either will be appreciated here  which works better under windows 00 any driver problems etc cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc  basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and bad   well i bought the bj 000 about a month ago at the start of their 00 rebate program on that printer it ends 000 and i bought it from computer discount warehouse because their price of 000 couldnt be beat anywhere i looked and i think its a hot printer  just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode  i compared the output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with 0pt type done on my bj 000 with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed how well i could read the small print on the bj 000  printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj 000 which is amazing considering that the hp has 00m ram installed  i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows  i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office and two other engineers placed their orders too  if you need cdws phone number its 0000000000  delivery to ny was two days  good luck   craig witkowski ceng00maccvmcorpmotcom motorola communications  electronics inc glen rock  nj    i own a deskjet 000 performance isnt spectacular under windows using truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen quality for the hp is very much dependent on paper quality  on standard photocopy paper the characters have slightly frayed edges but on better quality distinction type paper things look better for most applications i find copy paper fine  still better than dotmatrix  comes with a windows driver which seems to bypass print manager has a few intellifontswhich are hp scaleable fonts  probably faster than truetype but havent really tried them out can get ram  font cartridges but unless the speed of truetype is a problem i wouldnt bother the ram cartridges cant be used as buffer  soft fonts only  for graphics ie bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via the hp supplied win driver there a number of dither options such as scatter pattern etc  the manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed  text is not so good in this mode problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text  the range of tones for graphic images isnt brilliant but i think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general  from what i have seen the canon is similar in most respects  however a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from epson  this printer is faster cheaper and capable of producing laserlike quality on normal copier paper  cant remember the model  lx  something i think  i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here   the introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand     about a month ago i got a canon bj000  i absolutely love it  it is incredibly fast except for printing from pspice i dont know if you ever do stuff with that or not  most of the stuff i print is either from microsoft word for windows or just plain text  the only problems ive had are printing headersfooters the printer freaked out and printing on cheap paper lots of streaks  normal copy paper works great with it you can only tell its not laserprinted by holding it oh less than twelve inches from your face  that is if youre nearsighted like me   the printer comes with its own driver for windows 00  i have no other complaints  the printer also can act just like some epson or another for those archaic software packages that havent written a driver for it yet the teenyweeny footprint is a real plus tooand if you purchase it between now and may 00 you get a 00 rebate from canon  i bought mine from a store called compusa and the price now is 000  i have a friend who has the hp you are looking at  it also prints very well and everyone has drivers for it but it is very slow  hope i helped  000dpi sure looks great  heather stehman     in message 0000apr000000000000csdnewshoststanfordedu  kaymancsdd0stanfordedu robert kayman writes  hello fellow netters   i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj000 bubblejet vs the hp deskjet 000  i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential  and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson    various questions deleted    well i bought the bj 000 about a month ago at the start of their  00 rebate program on that printer it ends 000 and i bought it from  computer discount warehouse because their price of 000 couldnt be  beat anywhere i looked and i think its a hot printer  just using  regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality  mode  i compared the output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing  with 0pt type done on my bj 000 with the same drawing printed on  an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed how well i could read the small print  on the bj 000  printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj 000  which is amazing considering that the hp has 00m ram installed  i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving  data as i used print manager in windows      i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj000 at work and a deskjet 000 at home  i prefer the deskjet  the printing speed and quality are similar i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet for home  the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications  the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm proprinter to get it to work with many nonwindows apps and this will be the case for a long time  the design is superior if you just want to use cut paper the deskjet is quieter and the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs    just my 000 worth    mike mattix agricultural group of monsanto po box 000 luling la 00000 internet address dmmattbigezmonsantocom      yes there is the landscape mode printing problem but it does not present a problem in windows as the windows printer driver handles the translation  i actually thought of some other points after i posted the note  the deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately 0inch around the paper the bubblejet does not  you are right about the graphics resolutions i tested the printers with the applications i had access to wordperfect harvard graphics wingif paintshop pro and paintbrush and could not tell a difference  in fact one of the hp deskjet windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down  the bubblejet did not i had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there  finally i wanted sheet feeding  in that configuration the bubblejet cost approximately 000 more than the deskjet  i went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i spent my own money  btw i am replacing the bj000 with a deskjet 000 at work this month anyway  regards  mike mattix ag group of monsanto luling la    i spent some time comparing the two  we ended up getting the bubblejet bj000 versus the hp  our reasons were  0 the hp seemed to have worse banding than the canon 0 000dpi versus 000  we felt we could see the difference 0 price  canon has a 00 rebate program going on at the moment  the bj000 was our choice over the bj00ex  we could have 000 pages in the bj000 feeder  the bj00ex holds only 00 pages i think  as you can see up to 000 pages on the bj000  we havent done anything big with the bj but its performance seems reasonable under windows  i know that the microsoft bbs has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer but i dont know how it compares also the driver included with the printer is canons whereas i dont know where the microsoft bbs one comes from  microsoft  hope this helps   thomas v frauenhofer wa0yyw tvfccicom uunetuupsicci000tvf tvfcsritedu mandlebratwurst the meal that eats itself    altough im sometimes also a salesperson if im not suppost to study  i would recommend to buy the bj000 the printing quality is a bit better but you youve got much more possiblities dont forget the hp engine is at least 0 years on the marked the canon engine witch is also used in other new bubblejet printers like eg the epson ones is quite recently available   now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 000  dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlettpackard deskjet 000 000 dpi  which is faster  is there a noticeable print quality difference  particularly in graphics  which will handle large documents better 00  ive seen during a short demonstration from someone who tryed to sell me canon printers 0 times the same picture one printed with the bj000 one with the canon the other with the hp and there was a difference in printing quality the canon was a bit better  greetz  kris    when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers  they have near laser quality speed and they are quiet we use both hp deskjets and the canon bj000s  i prefer the paper handling qualities of the deskjets but i feel the canons have superior print quality  the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder however i did end up buying a deskjet for home use got too good a deal  anyway we are using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well  out of 00 deskjets and 0 bj000s i have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by hp  nate    whenever i buy anything i look at what the experts say pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt  ive been unusually flush lately no begging letter please and so ive done this a few times including  about four months ago  with inkjet printers  i cant remember much about the process except that i read about three reviews of inkjets and that the 000 was always at or near the top  i bought the 000c because of the added dimension of colour i intend to build a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that  although i havens used the colour thing in earnest yet i tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the result  i note that even though you can now get the 000c the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge the 000c and 000 are still readily available at least in the uk  the following are my viewsexperience  0i dont know anything about the canon except that i came away from reviews and replies to a posting similar to yours with the idea that the hp offered the best performanceprice ratio  0i believe hp are the originals in the field  not always the ideal place to be but the markets still young so one assumes they have the expertise  0the 000c is worth the extra  operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from windows  0i used to work for monotype when they still manufactured typesetters before their american owners closed them down and i can tell you that in terms of definition 000 dpi is pretty poor anyway so 000 dpi is just a bit less poor  0the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers  0if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack  its pretty slow with it god knows what its like without  i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so its not in daily use  i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start its easy peasy to operate  hope this is of use  regards  david    just bought the bj000  i thought the price couldnt be beat 000 with 00 rebate thru 000 and so far it is comparable even superior to the deskjet in print quality  speed   per page rate seems to be faster i dont have figures          i dont print long docs though  quality i think the graphics quality is excellent  print quality is          excellent as well unless you use small fonts and hold it up          close you can see a lot more jaggies than on a laserjet          the 000 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the          pageprint head in place i would imagine  large docs  not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages           manual says up to 000 though  havent tried it  drivers  no problems under win00 yet  winword doesnt want to print          the envelopes the same way the canon does though  know nothing of addon costs   daniel a hartung    dhartungchinetchinetcom    ask me about rotaract    the deskjet is slow  this is in comparison to the other printers i mentioned  i have no idea how the bubblejet compares  the interface between win00 and the printer is just dandy ive not had any problems with it  i just bought a bj000 printer a couple of days ago  i compared it to the sample print of an hp deskjet 000 and knew that the hp wasnt for me  the bj000 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality  i can compare it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical  depending on the kind of paper  i dont have problems with the ink not being dry it seems to dry very fast  probably within a second  since canon is giving a 00 rebate until the end of may it is really a good buy    sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications    wow its funny you should ask this  im a little behind in news reading so i know this may be late    i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night  i was really worried that i wouldnt like it but the print quality and noise level is fantastic  i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed damn near laser quality  you cant tell its not laser unless you get 0 inches from the page    no problems with drivers  the printer came with the driver diskette which is good because i was beginning to panic when i couldnt findi it under windows or wordperfect  it works well under both  i have yet to install word for windows so dont know how it works with them    i had a deskjet 000 at work last year  it was a good printer as well ut i felt it was awfully slow  and much noisier than the bubblejet  i wont say the bubblejet is much better but i really do like it more  just my 000 worth   brett    sincerely  robert

  i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa counterparts for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iise is only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus which isnt what i would call fast  i dont understand why eisa video cards arent as a group on the same level of performance as local bus cards given that eisa video cards have a 00 bit bus to move data around instead of isas 0 bits  since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board such as a diamond speedstar 00x from pc magazines i think recent report i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card but its around 000 which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend and for 000 i could get a diamond viper and still have 000 left over of course id have to get a local bus mother board too  can anyone shed some light on my confusionfrustration  thanks   christopher wroten cfwworldstdcom

  mark woodruff cda00000ucf0vmbitnet writes  ive been running dos 0 for about a month  i was generally impressed with the improvements  the multiple boot configurations were great the new commands were nice and doublespace worked fine twice as slow for large data transfers twice as fast for small with smartdrv  until now  this morning at 0 am while i was working on my research paper i had to reboot a hung dos program that did no disk io from within windows 00 when my machine finished rebooting i found my windows directory and about two thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted  i cannot afford problems like this  im returning to dos 0  mark  ps  ive also noticed bad sector errors from doublespace where none should       exist  infoworld april 00 0000 issue has two articles about problems with dos 0  a second look article calls it a loaded gun and that people should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it  the point out that doublespace and memmaker are both problem areas that will cause a number of folks problems  mss response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported that they could duplicate probably are not trying too hard  cringely reports that a lot of folks are gettinggoing to get burned on the 000 support lines  his example was a call that cost 0000  for 0 minutes of tech support after 00 minutes on hold  i want to see the ms spin doctors explain this

  i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a novell administrators point of view   i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they microsoft has decided to implement as a standard for software support the local setup described below as the most advantageous installation if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then i will comply but id like to hear it from administrators first   the local windows installation  windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive assuming the resources are available  from a network administrators implementation heshe would install all windows disks on a network drive using setupa then install windows on a permachine bases by running setup off the network to install the complete system on the local drives  in this way all drivers are available to the setup procedure wo the need to change disks   advantages  reduce traffic  running windows locally reduces network traffic due to   the local access of main windows files  network independence  if the network fails and they all do at one point   or another the local installation would allow users to keep producing   and reduce the cost of downtime  faster windows  theoretically windows will run faster from a local hard   drive than over a network  this may be a hard point to prove if the network   has an optical backbone andor the network drives are significantly faster   access than local ones  a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about   varying setups monochrome color types of mouse etc since the   windows installation is assigned to the workstation   disadvantages  cost  installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk   space  workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can   increase the cost of the workstation from 00 to 00 percent  administration  local windows installations are very difficult to administer   new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available each of   which would have to be individually installed on each workstation  security  users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system   files from simple ignorance  this could result in quite a headache for   administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations  backup  we all know the problems backing up local hard disks  the backup   sets if done via a centralized tape system get very large very quickly   backup individually to floppy may not happen at all  this may be   eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable   applications and not user data   the shared windows installation  windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setupa procedure described above  users or administrators then install a minimal set of files to individual user directories  these directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network home directory  the bulk of the windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory some 000 files and are accessed shared asneeded by users throughout their windows session  the users files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during hisher windows session  these include group files ini files and other regularly updated files   advantages  a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy  as   an updated driver becomes available it only needs to be installed in this   single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it  assuming that the users files are maintained in network home directories   the administrator can easily edit any ini file asneeded to correct   problems that may arise  this includes winini and systemini  backup of all pertinent files is done easily  even if the users files   are on a local hard disk the bulk of the windows system is backed up with   all driver updates   disadvantages  network traffic  since all windows files are being shared in a network   directory traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the   speed of windows  if the network crashes all production comes to a stop since windows   is reliant upon the network for its files  loss of data usually occurs   as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will   usually not be able to save their work  although minimal disk space is still a consideration  if the users files   are maintained on the network a large number of users can cause a   significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows   files alone  users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation   hardware are similar  this is due to the windows installation being   tied to a particular username in the case of network user files    the discussion  i would like to know from other administrators with a large windows userbase how they prefer setting up windows  personally i have setup numerous installations using the shared setup  all windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks  in fact i sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money   i would also like to see recommendations for applications  should apps such as word andor excel be installed locally regardless of how windows is installed  again i keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is putting all eggs in one basket if the network crashes work comes to a halt   now i am sure microsoft and i know your out there has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to hear from people with actual working experience with users and network administration

  i dont know much about computers so please bear with me heres my question  context i use a package called slip on my home computer to connect to the          university mainframe an ibm 0000 running vmsmvs and log on to my          account when i installed slip on my computer i had to configure it          for my modem 000 kbs etronics internal and had to supply the phone          number to dial to reach the mainframe the way it works now is that          i type telnet uicvm or tn0000 uicvm either will work at the dos          prompt uicvm is the node name of the mainframe the program then          dials the mainframe establishes a protocol and gives me the logon          screen telnet and tn0000 are the names of batch files in my slip          directory i have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the          session  problem i would like to be able to do all this under windows 00 because i          hardly ever use dos directly slip will not run under windows i          talked to the people at our computer center and they suggested that          i use a packet driver called winpktcom with slip they gave me          instructions on how to load it before i start windows and how to          modify the tcpstart and tcpstop batch files in the slip directory          to ensure that it would work i did all that and i could run slip          from windows but there were other problems for one thing slip          would not hang up the phone when i exited i had to run my communi          cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when          that didnt work for another there were too many errors it often          took me 00 tries to connect to the mainframe our computer center          does not support slip under windows so i cant keep going back to          them with more questions  question is there some other shareware package that will run under windows          and do what slip is supposed to do i need a package that is not too          expensive which is why i am looking for shareware i have heard that          there are regular commercial packages that do all this but they cost          hundreds of dollars these are the main requirements           0 must be able to run under windows 00          0 must allow vt000 and ibm tn0000 terminal emulation          0 must allow ftp file transfers since thats the only kind the             mainframe allows no ymodem or zmodem etc i believe the ftp             transfers are made through a kermit protocol but im hazy about             that           a subsidiary feature that would be nice to have if its a true          windows program rather than a dos program modified to run under          windows is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently          with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet          session and other applications  any information received is appreciated  pankaj saxena u00000uicvmuicedu

   i know this is probably a faq but  i installed the sw for my ati graphics card and it bashed my windows logo files  when i start windows now it has the 00 logo instead of the 00 logo  i thought the files that controlled this were  windowssystemvgalogorle windowssystemvgalogolgo  i restored these files but it didnt change the logo  anyone know what the correct files are  i believe you have the correct files i think what youll have to do is go back into setup and choose change video adapter or whatever it is called then the trick is choose the same adaptor you currently have what setup does is it actually changes the file wincom whenever you go into it and change the video hardware selection it incorporates the contents of vgalogorle into wincom when you do this this trick can also be used to change the startup logo into whatever you want it to be   sig alert  dbstruttacsucalgaryca end sig alert  
  has anyone observed this  if i copy a large say 000k file a large pkzip file for instance to my floppy drive 00 under ms windows 00 via either program manager or a dos shell the file copied under the dos shell  has errors whereas the file copied from within program manager does not  the corruption is detected by executing pkunzip t bfilezip after  both copies  the file copied via the dos shell always shows corruption   now heres the kicker   i have many windows open while doing this both dos and windows apps supposedly all windows apps share the same time slice whereas the  dos apps get their own equal time slice unless overriden   so as an example i have 0 windows apps open 0 multitasking dos sessions running and one executionexeclusive dos shell iconized inactive  under this  scenario cpu time is divided into two major slices  one for all the windows apps and one slice for the running dos app    when copying under windows pgm mgr ill assume the other windows and dos tasks are essentially inactive  thus pgm mgr gets say 00 of the windows slice and 00 of the executionbackground dos shells slices  thus it gets 0000   00 or 00 of the total available cpu time   when copying in a dos shell i activate the executeexclusive mode dos shell no other dos background tasks allowed full screen under the windows task manager  the cpu time available to this shell would be 00 of the windows slice assumming inactive windows applications and 000 of the dos slice  000  0 or 00 of the total available cpu time  so why do i get copy errors under dos if it has the greater amount of cpu time  is program manager working in a preemptive mode during the floppy  copy  it must be    miscellaneous data  running windows on top of dos 00 qemm 0x rapidbiossys                      00 mbyte smartdrive no delayed writes two ramdrives                       logitech mouse driver 00 full 00mbytes motherboard ram                      00kbyte motherboard cache 000 dx 00 mhz                                            running doseditcom tsr in the dos shell                          wayne long  oe000              internet wclriscspsmotcom 0000 william cannon drive west  uucp cstexaseduoakhillriscwcl austin texas 000000000        phone 000 0000000  fax 0000000

  from article c00ubgk0wworldstdcom by cfwworldstdcom christopher f wroten  i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most  eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa  counterparts for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iise is  only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus which isnt  what i would call fast    i dont understand why eisa video cards arent as a group on the  same level of performance as local bus cards given that eisa video  cards have a 00 bit bus to move data around instead of isas 0 bits   good question answer the eisa bus does move 00 bits rather than isas 000         but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus         i think thats either 0 or 00 mhz         the local bus designs also move 00 bits like the eisa but         they move the data at the cpu speed up to 00 mhz         so on a 00mhz cpu the local bus is moving 00bit data at         00 mhz and the eisa is moving 00bit data at 0 or 00 mhz         so the local bus should be 0 to 0 times faster than eisa on         a 00 mhz cpu  eisa should be about two maybe 0 times as         fast as isa   since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher  cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than  and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board such as a  diamond speedstar 00x from pc magazines i think recent report  i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card but its  around 000 which is just about double what my wallet will allow  me to spend and for 000 i could get a diamond viper and still  have 000 left over of course id have to get a local bus mother  board too   thats a very good question  the eisa bus does have more advantages over the isa bus than just its width  for example morebetter  interrupts and bus mastering  but these other factors do not impact  a video card very much  they have more impact on file servers with  multiple hard drives fullthrottle network cards cdroms etc   can anyone shed some light on my confusionfrustration    thanks   christopher wroten cfwworldstdcom      
  says  does anybody here know whether windows nt doeswill include a x windows server     could you add some information to no it does not say for instance your source of information  source for does not comment the cdrom and manuals for the march beta  there is no x windows server there  will there be  of course  even if microsoft supplies one with nt other vendors will no doubt port theirs to nt  according to a recent newsletter from hummingbird communications ltd they announced exceedent at uniforum 00  the announcement reads like it is here now but there is no order or price info  i would guess it must be rsn  there is a dev kit too  
  regarding the horror stories about dos0doubledisk and stacker 0 killing hard drives  i was wondering if the dos 0 mirror command works on the doubled drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table if it records the vital doubledisk info then using it daily should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the type of catastrophic failure discussed  if it doesnt then shame on microsoft   
  hi  ive got an older 00000 motherboard old as in uses a 0000 keyboard controller and uses memory interleaving rather than caching it has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause the machine to lock up reset button required but only when in 000 enhanced mode  this occurs in norton desktop file manager and when trying to install software  running win 00 in standard mode works fine  has anyone run into this  any ideas  much thanks appreciated  david yonworldstdcom

   i have a 000 sx 00 and i recently added a scsi drive to my system using an   adaptec 0000 non busmastering controller yesterday i ran coretest to   find out drive performance and these are the values i got  seagate 000 meg 0000kbsec000ms avg seek   00ms track to track  quantum 000 meg scsi 0000 kbsec  000 avg seek 00 track to track  first off all are these good results i dont know what typical values   are  what im wondering now is the following my swap file is currently on the   ide i could move it to the scsi which is 00 faster but then i would not   be able to use 00bit access which might actuall make it slower so on   which drive should i put my swap file to get best results is there a swap   file speed test program out there  finally i also ran the above tests with the aspi0dos driver loaded and i   got no difference whatsoever in performance is there any reason at all   why i should load this driver  thanks in advance i will post a summary if i get enough responses  eric  
   on my pc i almost exclusively run windows the only dos based application   i have is procommplus  in my configsys i have emm000 loaded with the   option noems no expanded memory following a thread in one of the comp   newsgroups i read that it was no necessary to have emm000 loaded indeed   in the manual it says that emm000 is used to get expanded memory out of   extended memory since i have the noems option it seems to me that the   emm000 device is useless in my case   should i use emm000 or should i remove it from my configsys  thanks for your help  eric

   hi   i am thinking of upgrading to the beta version of windows nt on a 000sx 00mhz 000mb hard disc can someone please give me there opion on such a setup for running nt and is the operating system likely to be better than windows or  unixs   steve eed000ukackingceres  ive been using windows nt tm since the october release and i have to  say that the march release is really a big improvement  windows nt tm is becomming usable  there are a few things to consider before you make the leap though first for me at least is that you cannot get a fullspeed dos box what i mean is i cannot for instance run falcon 00 or any other resourse intensive program in a dos box  it absolutley crawls   and my machine is a 00000 with a 000mb hd and 00mb ram  if anyone knows how to get a fast dos box or fullscreen for that matter  please let me know  the second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff for instance my pas00 has been demoted to running as a sound blaster which is natively supported  nice because mediavision hasnt  produced drivers yet  your disk should be large enough to keep an 00mb dos partition and give the rest over to windows nt tm  the only thing is whenever you wanted to run windows programs youd have to reboot and log into windows nt tm instead of just typing win  windows nt tm does seem to be much more stable than normal windows though  itd be a good choice if you have the resources  you should really have at least 0mb ram though  one last thing modems work well enough but i have yet to get my fax card to work and ive never heard of anyone else who did either  its only better than unix because it runs killer software out of the box whereas with unix there isnt the same availablity  i guess it comes down to  windows nt tm is not yet for the faint of heart its still a beta  but its a very good beta       scott reimert      reimertmamacassetdesgtrwcom     standard disclaimer redondo beach ca blah blah blah   always store beer in a cool dark place

  suppose you want to change the particular icon for a program in windows such as the msdos one  would someone let me know how you can do this    it depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that comes standard with windows or with an icon from some other icon manager  well if it is one of those that comes with windows just highlight the  item by clicking once on it click on file and then on properties you should see a box which says change icon click on it you are going to be presented with some icons sometimes just one if you dont like any of those presented click on the browse box and look for the file moriconsdll select it browse through the icons presented and just double click on your desired icon  if you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager say iconpower for instance open the icon manager at the bottom of your screen where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace when you have found your desired icon click on it once and while holding the mouse button down pull this icon over the one you wish to change and thats it  regards    kan mongwa             mongwaacsubuffaloedu                          state univeristy         bitnet   v000wxkpubvms     humpty dumpty     of new york  buffalo               c000wxkpubvm

   has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so what have you done to cure it  one workstation in a wfw network goes deaf to any form of communication from other workstations until it goes out on the network itself from then on other workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf  again   the workstation is set up to share its discs etc the machine is a 000dx00 0mb ram with diamond stealth video  it behaves this way with a variety of 00 bit network adapters including a smc elite it also behaves the same way if i use the windows vga driver rather than the diamond drivers

overview      the dib image file format is intended to be a device independent  bitmap     file  format  what microsoft means by device independent is unclear to     me four pixel resolutions are supported 0 bit 0 bit 0 bit and 00 bit     pixels      these images were intended for use on dos ibm or littleendian systems     ifyou  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte     swap all short and long integer values      by convention dib images end in the extension bmp   this  is  because          march 00 0000           0        they  are  a  superset of earlier bitmap image files  consequently you     will sometimes hear dib files referred to as bmp files      since dib images files are a superset there are three flavors  of  dib     images  o   dos dib images  these are the recommended convention  and  the      form  which i will describe how to create they are intended for      applications running under ms windows 00 in a dos environment  o   os0 dib images  my understanding is that these are  theflavor      of dib images that were used by the presentation manager  o   oldstyle bitmap images                                               march 00 0000           0        differences between flavors      the dos dib images consist of  0  a bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file as  a      dib  file  thisheaderalso gives the total size of the image      file and the offset to the image data  0  a bitmapinfoheader  image  header  which specifies  the image      attributes  0  an optional palette of colors used by the image  if  it  exists      this  may contain 0 00 or 000 entries  each entry is a windows      rgbquad structure  0  the image data itself       the os0 dib images consist of  0  the same bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file      as a  dib file this  header also gives the total size of the      image file and the offset to the image data  0  a bitmapcoreheader  image  header  which specifies  the image      attributes  0  an optional palette of colors used by the image  again if  this      exists  it may  contain  0 00 or 000 entries  each entry is a      windows rgbtriple structure  0  the image data itself       the old style image bitmap consists of  0  either a bitmapinfoheader or a  bitmapcoreheader whichheader      type is determined by the first long integer dword value  0  an optional color palette  thispalette may  be  composed  of      either   windowsrgbquad  structures  if  theheaderwas  a      bitmapinfoheader or windows rgbtriple structures if theheader      was a bitmapcoreheader  0  the image data itself       creating dib image files      creating a dos dib image file consists of several straight forwardsteps     the headers need to be created and then written to the file  these header     structures are defined in the ms  windows00  windowshinclude file     palette  information  needs to  be stored for images that are not 00bit     images  the five general steps are  0  filling  in  the  bitmapfileheader  andthe   bitmapinfoheader      structures the basic image information  0  if the image is a 0bit 0bit or an 0bit image creating  the      color palette of rgbquads  0  calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in          march 00 0000           0         the bfsize field of the bitmapfileheader

quantity m  0  b  0x0d00 on an intel system      the bfsize field is the total size of the file  for ourpurposes  this     field  is equal to the size of the bitmapfileheader plus the size of the     bitmapinfoheader plus the number of entries in the colorpalette times     the size  of  a  rgbquad plus the number of bytes of image dataif the     image data is being written out in an uncompressed form this value can be     calculatedahead  of  time   otherwise this field needs to be filled in     later      both the bfreserved0 and the bfreserved0  fields  are  always  set  to     zero      the bfoffbits field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data     from  the  start  of the file  for our purposes this field should be set     to the  size  ofthe   bitmapfileheader  plus the   size   of   the     bitmapinfoheader  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times     the size of a rgbquad  this works out because the image data  is  written     write after the

contains  a  bitmapinfoheader and   not   a     bitmapcoreheader      the biwidth field is the width of the image in image pixels      the biheight field is the height of the image in image lines      the biplanes field should always be set to 0  this data is written  out     as if there was one color plane      the bibitcount field is the bitdepth of the image  this must be either     0 0 0 or 00 depending on the bitdepth of the image data      the bicompression field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is     compressed   dibimagessupport two  forms  of runlength  encoding     however i have never seen any images which use it and dont know yet how     it works  set this field to zero long zero or 0l to indicate that the     data is not compressed      all subsequent fields of the bitmapinfoheader  structure  may  be  set  to     zero   a  requirement  ofthe  interpretting software that it be able to     compute these fields as necessary from the previous information      the field which you might want to explicitly specify might be biclrused     for 0bitand  0bit  images  this  field indicates that not all of the     possible color entries are used and that the  image contains  biclrused     colors  if you are using only 00 colors with an 0bit image then you may     only want to save 00 of the possible 000 palette entries  generally  set     this field to

three surprises about the ordering of image datain  dib image     file   the creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative and     certainly was      within the image data each line written out is padded to  the  next  four     byte  quantity   so  if  you had an 0bit image which was only one pixel     wide you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line   the     number of

when writing out your image data you must write it out bottom line first     the bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the     first line of image data in the file      for 0bit 0bit and 0bit images information is writtenas  you would     expect   one  bitimagesare  padded  eight pixels to a byte  four bit     images are padded two pixels to a byte  eight bit images are written  one     pixel per byte  twentyfour bit images are written three bytes per pixel     however for 00bit images the information must  be written  out  in  the     order  blue  green red  while

  i have a very funny yet confusing problem  i am using telemate within win 00  everytime i close dos box my telemate operation get affected normally i am doing file transfer  however if i open  close windows program everything seems running smoothly  my file transfer operation get affected only if i close dos box  can somebody please gimme some pointers on what is going on and how to fix it  thanks in advance glenn jayaputera  
   a friend of mine uses windows 00 to do most of her work unfortunately she has very bad eyesight and we havent been able to figure out how to change the default font used by the system and application menus or the font used by the help program what use is hypertext if you cant read it to make it legible to her  if anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts of any software package that makes windows more accessible to visually handicapped people please let me know  thanks dan

  hi  i am trying to develop a utility to view word for window file but  to do that i need to know the format of the doc  word for window file  format  filescan anybody  tell me what is the format of doc file or  direct me where can i get it or is it proprietory format  your help is greatly appriciated  thanks  the format for word for windows doc files is available from microsoft call their developer support services number sorry dont have it handy and ask for the word for windows binary file format spec  warning  it is not terribly useful and you will need to do a lot of looking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored  general primer  word for windows stores its data in two chunks  the first chunk is the actual text in the file  this is all stored together and has nothing but text and graphics  the second chunk is the formatting information  for general use to read a word for windows file skip the first 000 bytes of the file its a general header  then read the remaining text until you hit binary data  matt

  rsrodgerwamumdedu yamanari writes id say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by an errant application my personal favorite  any one of the corel 00 programs  on the other hand i have had os0 crash randomly a number of times mostly just running its own applications  i  do know  that  ibm systems the ps0 00slc0 in  particular have absolutely no  problem  with  os0never had  a random crash  while running any of  my programs under  os0   in fact i  dont  remember ever crashing  of course i really dont run any  os0 programs just the  same bunch of dos and windows stuff that ive always been running  and  when  i  had  the  00slc  this is  the  000slc  system  running doswindows i had only  one crash and it was consistent   ftp had a tendency  to  crash  whenever  i would  get  large  files 0mb  from particularly fast  clients  dtrs  000k000ksec i  figured out the problem was with smartdrvs write bufferingif i turned off the write buffer everything would work fine  ftp under os0 has never locked  though  i can even format  floppies to use the most often cited example of the superiority of os0  for instance im still wondering why print preview in a windowed wp 00 dos locks up my system  yeah i guess im willing to admit that os0  is somewhat sensitive to specific hardware  wp00 for dos works perfectly fine on my slc0  please explain  the only time i wait on anything under windows is when im copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even then not longi get 0 to 00 pages dumped to the printman per  minute and can still go do thingsslowlywhile its doing  thisive downloaded with pp 0000 while printing  well  i save all  my  personal files to floppy  and when  i did that under windows a floppy save of a large file hung up the system  i  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever i wanted to do a fractal computation in the background   and not being able to address your memory better than dos  not sure what you mean here  the idea is  that os0s dos sessions can see more memory than windows dos  sessions  i  let  xpl a  shareware calculus program see around 000kb of free conventional memory which lets me  do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible  under straight dos where it would see around 000kb of conventional ram  i  also found it really handy for my own dosbased programs which without  any rewriting could now handle larger data sets simulate for more iterations etc of course the  point is  now moot  since  the os0 programs i now write  simply never run into memory limitations  i never programmed  for windows so i dont have much of a comparison here though

  im working at a workstation which is usually attached to a novell network using shell version 000 i think the workstation a 000 was set up to run windows 00 with the network about a year ago needless to say id like to upgrade it to windows 00 and have it work with the network  basically the windows filesd be on the local hard drive but several dos applications like word perfect will be on the network id mainly want windows to access the network drives the network printers and perhaps handle some network functions as well if i could multitask the dos apps whose executables are on the network thatd be great but i could live without it  eventually id like to get a few other 000s in the office working with the network and windows 00 as well however most of the terminals are 000s which leaves the network pretty much dosbound and i guess that leaves out windows for workgroups and in the future maybe thered be norton desktop but thats gettingahead of myself  as you can guess ive never done anything like this before ive read through the networks material that came with windows but still id like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area  please reply by email i dont scan these newsgroups often  thanks for any replies   brian rev pk siano                                  revpkcellarorg  well ill know right away by the look in her eyes shes lost all illusions and shes worldly wise and i know if i give her a listen shes what ive been missing what ive been missing ill be lost in love and havin some fun with my cynical girl whos got no use for the real world im looking for a cynical girl            marshall crenshaw cynical girl

  ive started getting a message from windows 00 whenever i try to execute a dos program from windows either thru the program manager or the file manager a message box comes up and says this program or one of its components is compressed use the msdos expand command to expand the file  now i know this is bogus because i can always execute the program from dos when not running windows the program in question is commandcom yup the basic dos command line shell and the expand command tells me that the file is already expanded  all my windows apps work just fine  i only get this message when trying to execute a dos program from windows  clues anyone  thanks   christopher wroten cfwworldstdcom

    well ive come into some money and want to buy cdrom sound board and speakers  i have not kept up on any material relating to sound boards and cdroms because until now i never thought id have enough money      so can you gurus out there point me in the direction of a good package including cdrom sound and speakers and software i suppose or since i dont really need the cdrom right now give me some good ideas for sound boards and speakers  those i could really use now  i have looked at soundblaster pro which costs about as much as i think i want to spend on a board 000 and ive looked at the gravis sound board which is about 000 and i dont know the advdisadv of either of these boards      right now i want to use it with any games that support sound and to use in windows 00 to utilize sound capabilities there  so any concise info on sound boards complete multimedia packages etc would be greatly appreciated  if anyone else is interested in this info i would be glad to summarize responses and post      and if this is some type of faq please point me in the right direction and dont bother taking up a lot of bandwidth  thanks   brett   brett watson databasesystem administrator kansas supreme court  topeka ks   
    i have just upgraded from a trident tvga0000 to an ati graphics ultra the old mach0 chip  i am quite pleased with the performance so far but have one problem  when using windows in 000x000 i have noticed that the  tile bars and scroll bars are significantly larger than they were when i was using the trident card  is there a setting in my ini files that i can change to make these smaller   i could not find the faq for this list  mike  mdtancsawatartsuwaterlooca   make sure you use the small fonts driver  not the large fonts driver check that in your setup thats the only explanation i would find   hope this helps   gel

  everyone seems to think that this mans mouse problem is mechanical its dirty  i have been having a similar problem with my mouse and it only occurs when ru nning windows and therefore cannot be mechanical in nature   its my understanding that bus mice are more accurate and stable in general than serial mice  if i remember correctly its because of the differences in how the interrupts are handled as well as the fact that the mouse data is received over the computer bus as opposed to a 0000 bps serial connection  im running a mouse  systems compatible mouse on a 000 00 dx0 with a trident 0 meg video card and a m experienceing similar jumpiness as well as strange font subsitutions and mous e traces left on screen and windows gpf errors help  is this just a general problem or is it associated with a specific application or group of applications

   i am working with visual basic v00 for windows specifically i am working on an application that generates formatted reports since some of these reports can be rather large my first question is  0  is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in visual basicwindows beyond the 00k limit  as i have not as yet  being optimistic  come across a way to get around the above problem i am working on the following approach  i am trying to create my own defined template in msword using the wordbasic macros so that i can open up word from visual basicvb and load this template of mine which will work in the following way  it will first open myownini file created in vb  at the time when the user selected the kind of report he weanted and read the section from the ini file and jump to the appropriate code in template  which will then open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the ini file  0  when using the getprofilestring function in wordbasic is there a way to specifychange the default ini file which is winini to myownini file  0 when using the file input function in wordbasic  is there a way to read more than the 00k at one time   any help will be appreciated  pguptamagnusacsohiostateedu   
  im looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs  a couple of issues ago pc mag listed as editors choices both conversion artist and hijaak for windows  anyone have any experience with those or some others  im trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days and im not making much progress with the screen shots     im currently using dodot and im about to burn it and the disks it rode it on  its got a lot of freaky bugs and oversights that are driving me crazy  tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a tiff file thats under a certain arbitrary size it will swap the left and right sides of the picture   usually it confines itself to not copying things to the clipboard so i have to save and load pix for editing in paintbrush or crashing every hour or so   the one nice thing it has though is its dither option  youd think that this would turn colors into dots which it does if you go from say 000 colors to 00 colors  but if you go from 000 or 00 colors to bw you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which turn to white  for me this is useful because i can turn light grays on buttons to white and the dark grays to black and thereby preserve the 0deffect on buttons and other parts of the window   if you understood my description  can you tell me if another less buggy program can do this as well   much thanks for any help  signature david delgreco                        what lies behind us and what lies technically a writer                  before us are tiny matters compared delgrecorahulnet                    to what lies within us                                                oliver wendell holmes   david f delgreco delgrecorahulnet

   and i would hardly call a command that can delete a tree and a move  command as a state of the art wizbang feature  they are damn necessary  i have often cursed not being able to have some kind of recursive delete  you are missing something  with the windows file manager you can  ms  but i dont want to have to run blasted windows every time i want to delete a tree  it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete some files  it would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a car   wants people to buy windows not dos  ms knows dos wont last forever  only because its crap which is noones fault but their own   they want you to move to windows 00 then later to win00 and eventually to  cairo  this way they give you a reason to  by deliberately crippling the product  surely no  oh hold on i guess youre right  that certainly stinks of microsoft marketing techniques  but the point still remains that a command to delete trees is not new technology and is the kind of thing one would have expected to see long before windows was even dreamt of         want good file handling  use filemanexe  this product requires  microsoft windows        dos is dead  well amen to that but i wish it were a damn sight deader  for a dead product its used an awful lot  and i suspect its going to carry on twitching for a long while yet which isnt doing anyone any good  and microsoft dont appear to have given up marketing dos so it is a very unusual form of death indeed    tim walls  sysop  protocol bbs   datafax 000000 000000        fidonet 0000000    amiganet 000000                         twallsncc0000ddemoncouk                          pgp 00 public key available   
  hiya  im using word for windows and i am quite satisfied with it except the  equation editor screws up all the time when i try to insert an equation it will give me two errors fence font not found and meta font not found the real problem is that it will not display or print out the integral sign does anyone else have this problem and how do i solve it im using a zsport 000 laptop with a panasonic 0000p printer running  msdos 00 and windows 00     thanks      falke   we all had that problem you need to expand the fonts manually the program decomp is on disk 0  the equations fonts are on disk 0    have fun  gel  
  seen from a typographically point of view atm using postscript fonts is better than truetype the hinting mechanism incorporated in ps is gorgeous multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in a ps font as problematically they may have better use of the unicode features of tt fonts in windows nt  ive seen lots of really beautiful and printableinsmallsize ps fonts i havent seen those as tt fonts most of them are rendering quite inaccurate in small sizes esp as screen fonts simply compare timesnewroman as a ps font with the tt font the first looks better  i am hoping that there will be atmnt     claudius mokler email moklerdesertinberlinde

anonymous ftp from  mishnaesyscwruedu internet no 000000000 a sample ftp session  is given at the end of this file     changes in version 00 update from v000 to v00  in this version we have revised cosypak to take advantage of  the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v00   since mathematica 00 provides a better  and  working  laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than  mathematica v00 did we adopted them this has made cosypak  smaller thus brian evans signal processing packages that supported  the laplacetransform  and inverselaplacetransform functions in the  cosypak v000 are no longer needed directly by cosypak v00 for  power users who  use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very   fine  brian evans package on signal processing available at  the anonymous  ftp site gausseedspgatechedu  or  ip  00000000000  on   the  downside the disadvantage of this update  can be that mathematica 00 requires more runtime resources than its  previous version      for mathematica 00 users  we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica 00 in   the directory for00 please move all files and directory under for00 into   the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory          introduction         this is an unsupported release of cosypak  a control systems  analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using  mathematica 00 classical control systems analysis and design methods and some   modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package           this package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a  next tm computer a unix based workstation they have been  used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control  engineering texts ogata 0000 phillips and harbor 0000 for  undergraduate courses in control engineering i taught at the systems  engineering department of cwru in addition to the next they have  also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers tm and  ibm pcs tm running ms windowstm we would be very much interested  to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this

  even so my point still stands to an extent  that 00k limits appear all over the place where they really are not necessary such as the edit control limit  while the 00k limit may not be necessary limitation they probably fall within the category of reasonable limitations  if you find yourself trying to allocate an edit control for more than 00k of text its probably time take a good look at your programs design  why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory handles allowed  in what way is 0000 a small number  it seems to me that youd hit the wall in many other ways before youd hit the systemwide limit on global handles unless of course youre abusing globalalloc   and please dont try to tell me that its impossible to abuse the resources available under other operating systems  all systems have limits  the question is whether or not the limits are reasonable  so far you havent offered a single argument which suggests that windows limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems     rick schaut uucpuunet  uwbeavermicrosoftrichs  microsoft doesnt speak for me and i dont speak for microsoft

  jenkmicrosoftcom jen kilmer writes  much bs deleted for brevity  again my point was that not all microsofties are here to sell  readers on our products which would conflict with the noads  philosophy of usenet  nor do we necessarily have access to info that others have  it certainly smacks of that remember the poll that you quoted saying that you had seen a 00 of users being satisfied with dos 00 care to recall how unbiased the sample set was that post sure looked like fudand coming from a microsoftie  well it sure seemed like something was not on level  advocacy is good  but spreading fud to advocate your favorite os is very  unethical  especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that os  i also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are like members of the borg  that is because their actions seem to invite this opinion  never seen more  defensive people in my life moreover many of their posts seem to encourage this too imho  seriously speaking it is a shame that ms techie employees get the heat for mss actions  most of which are perpetrated by the management and marketing i am sure that they are very talented etc  i have not doubts about their  abilities just about the ethics of their marketing practices  divya   divya  live long and then die a slow and horrible death    what confucius wanted to say

  hello  i want a little network for 0 users all users want to run windows the most important things i want for the network are filesharing mail utility two printers on one of the computers and a faxmodem card on one of the computers we all want to use each others harddisk  my idea was to buy three computers one 000dx and two 000dx all three have a 00mb local harddisk the 000 also has a very large harddisk all three also have a network card the 000 is connected to the printers and contains the faxmodem card and last but not least workgroups for windows  my questions  is this possible  what exactly are the possibilities and advantages of workgroups   for windows  will all the computers be fast enough behind all three someone   is working  thanks martijn

  in sasswb000000000k0 sasswbunxsascom scott bass writes  0  for windows nt is there an alternative to the archane fairly useless dos batch programming language  for os0 ibm introduced the rexx language as an alternative to bat  surely windows nt should do the same thing right  0  in lieu of the above is there any way to escape the crlf in a bat file and continue a single command across multiple lines  i have an application which exits to the system and submits a batch file  the batch file is created on the fly from sitespecific code stored within the application  as currently designed the line length for the stored code and the output file bat file is 00 characters which is not enough for all the options that must be specified on a particular command  it would help tremendously if i didnt have to redesign my code to kludge around the lack of a true batchshell programming language   rest deleted   as a followup to my post let me add that  im not really a windows or windows nt user so please excuse my ignorance however im a developer at sas institute and one component of the application that i support is the ability to submit a sas batch job from within an interactive sas session  the user site can enter their sitespecific batch profile into a dataset within our product specifying the pathname to the sas executable specifying site specific sas options etc  at run time certain variables are resolved and the resolved file is written to an external ascii file  then i exit to the operating system and run the job asynchronously returning to the interactive session as soon as the job is submitted  the batch job then runs concurrently with the interactive session  as currently designed the internal dataset has a record length of 00 characters  but to run the batch job the command to reinvoke sas in batch mode requires more than 00 characters  up til nt this has not been a problem since every job controlshell language up til nt eg mvscmsvmsunixos0 had a way to escape the crlf and enter a single command across multiple lines os0 via their rexx language which is standard with os0  the gist of all this is since this application is for endusers not within my company i have to try to develop this process using native nt since my first posting ive learned that there are several third party companies that provide alternative script languages for windowswindows nt and im sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative script language if they had it but i cant develop under the assumption that they have anything other than what comes with nt  i saw another post on this list the subject was something like is vi available for windows in which someone said that vi make awk and ksh was available with microsoft toolkit  what is that product  is it a separate product or part of windows  ksh would do what i need if i could count on it at all nt sites  one last question  ive heard that nt has remote processing capabilities ie i could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run there  if these are native nt commands rather than network specific commands this would also help me improve this process  if you can comment on these commands i would appreciate it  thanks again for the help    scott bass                             sas institute inc integrated systems a000 x0000        sas campus drive cary nc  000000000 sasswbk0unxsascom                  000 0000000 x0000

  ignore the attacks and look at the sales numbers and the ms stock price if you need some  gratification just keep doing the great job you have done in the past thx dave l  this is the part that usually gets me while i am set to make money there usually are other things to be considered and debated that is the purpose of life if you only willing to look at the stock price and sales numbers for gratification usually youll end up with japanese or whoever that is competitive owing your business  ie shortsighted imo this is very irresponsible narrow minded and selfish henceforth ignoring the attack is not the right approach as a matter of fact i just happen to believe the willingness to debate and readjust is the greatest assets of this society sales number and stock price is the shortterm result not the cause

    how does print manager deal with multiple printers     were planning   to print to two printers from an application  one will be a real printer and the other a   fax program     will print manager just deal with the jobs one at a time or will it feed to both printers at once   please research carefully  just because a fax modem behaves like a printer on a local machine doesnt guarantee functionality  when a local machine has fax software printing to a remotely installed fax card  i tried this with workgroups and the  fax software didnt like it at all  could have been winfaxs peculiarisms but i dont think so  a lot of special hardware interaction takes place internally  in my case a fax manager program merely intercepts the print job and spools it to its own directory not print managers spool directory  to software it appears the job was printed  print manager  plays no part in the handling of the actual process  pardon me if ive incorrectly assumed this is what you were up to  a truely networkaware faxmodem will most likely be required or a lot of weird setup and tinkering  good luck

  this is the part that usually gets me while i am set to make money there usually are other things to be considered and debated that is the purpose of life  like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product are measures of success they can be measures of short term or long term success i think in ms case they are a good measure of their long term success the original post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number of people attacking ms and not willing to accept anything positive about ms i was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to look at the sales of ms products they definitely tell a different story  i also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call them are highly technical look around in the real world people dont want to grep and auck and ls l they just want to push the buttons and get their  job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need  a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc like it or not ms and the multitudes of business applications that exist to run under windows does this and does it well we are running 000 pcs loaded with a complete suite of mostly ms windows applications in an administrative business function on a novell network running all software off the server it does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick windows again  again i repeat to ms keep doing what you are doing you are doing a great job flame on thx dave l

    hi  one of my coworkers is having a very odd problem  his mouse works fine in dos applications if you load them from the c prompt under windows the mouse pointer is present but does not move  even if you load a dos app under windows the mouse doesnt work    the computer is a zeos 000sx00 wdiamond speedstar vga running ms dos 00 and windows 00  mouse driver is microsofts 00  ive tried switching the mouse from com0 to com0 ive tried a different mouse ive reinstalled mousedrv and i cant get the blamed thing to work the only difference between his system and mine where the mouse works perfectly is that he has an expansion card with an additional parallel and serial port  could that cause the problem     thanks in advance for any help   carl fink          carlfpanixcom       cfink0 genie if you cant laugh at yourself then you can bet that everyone else is doing so  ed johnston

       i am setting up my dosunix box on a 000m ide and a 000m scsi drive  and was wondering about the use of the msdos 00 join command  i  like the way it sets things up since i wont have to stick with the c  d  e crap that dos enforces  i like how it would mimic mount  points of unix filesystems  i have heard that there were problems  with using it or at least under older versions of dos  please tell  i have been using the join command for many years now mostly with good success in duplicating unixstyle file mounts  you will hear lots of people cursing join because they confuse it with the dos append command a truely gnarly hack but dont believe them  you also will hear people saying that microsoft recommends that you not use join  but in microsofts windows 0 workgroups resource toolkit the following appears    join an msdos utility works fine with windows for workgroups 00 if   you do not change the state of the joined drives during a windows for   workgroups 00 session this includes adding or removing joined drives   from within windows for workgroups we recommend that you do not use   join when running windows setup or windows for workgroups 00  within this caveat join appears to be valid under windows  however i have found a couple of applications that dont deal well with filesystems that have been mounted using join  in particular the worst offender is word for windows 00x  it gets very confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive it wants to create the saved file as nnnnntmp in the current dir then delete the old file and rename the nnnnntmp file to the doc file  unfortunately wfw usually writes the nnnnntmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory often in the root dir of the joined filesystem but not always  then after deleting the original doc file it cant find the nnnnntmp file to rename it  unless you search your disk systems the document is gone  i have also found subtle problems using the mks toolkit from a dos box when joined filesystems are present  i used to join ctemp with a 0meg ramdisk but mks sometimes gets confused when doing an ls on the ctemp dir and misses some files in the temp dir  this is difficult to  reproduce but it goes away totally when join is not used  i think this is a windows problem rather than mkss since it works ok under raw dos  so i would suggest that you can use join but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like  wouldnt it be real great to mount network drives ie z under the main file tree rather than having all those darned drive letters unfortunately join wont let you do it  there was talk on the net about a simple patch to let join work on network drives but i dont remember the source  its too bad the join command is not better implemented since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters  i realize that messdos was meant for casual even ignorant users so mounting all the drives in one file tree might be confusing but it looks like ms is going to carry this over into windows nt another os meant for casual even igorant  users  not  with all its old family system baggage maybe ms needs a recovery group so they can get on with life    jerome jerry schneider             domain jlsatgcom  aspen technology group               uucp   uunetcsnatglabjls po box 000 ft collins co 00000    voice  000 0000000

   lots of stuff deleted because i felt like it   this ms bashing has definitely lost all its humor value  i think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users of ms products do not even know about internet and unix is that very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather comfortable abreviations they know and the abreviations have subtle differences between the different vendors while pc users tend to customize any windowing setup they can not do much with their  command line  so to most of the computer users in the world ms product symbolize quality ms has made their life easier and more productive and to them that is quality they do not care about what innovative things ms has done other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot easier you may know better than most computer users in this world but that will not change their perception  face it until unix come up with a decent gui that is available to all variations of unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream of computer users we here on the net are not mainstream computer users   brian    disclaimer the opinions expressed are mine not those of bnr     brian ws0s sttt userdeveloper   if i wanted a computer to play games   bell northern research               on id buy an amiga however i have    research triangle park nc           real work to do so please get lost

  i really think you are comparing apples and oranges nobody disputes that os0 has more big os features the question is does an  individual need the power the sales of windows vs os0 answer that question the next question is even if i did want to run os0 and i had this big monster machine to run it on is there a diverse set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my work go to your local computer store to answer this one i think the comparison you need to be doing is nt vs os000 this is where the new battle lines will be drawn windows 00 has won the single user pc war the next one will be the client server war and the entries are nt os000 unix and netware 00 granted these oss will be eventually scaled down to be attractive to the single user pc and that will probably be phase ii of the war who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure  is fun watching and arguing about it tho thx dave l       
  does anyone know how to absolute memory locations in windows ie  hardware that is memory mapped at very high addresses 00mb and above please reply by email thanks david  
  hello phjm you wrote   firstly does windows 00 in 000 enhanced mode do anything special  with dlls that have been compiled using the large memory model  no   we are being told that even in 000 enhanced mode windows  will load dlls into real memory below 000k and pagelock it  no   my second question relates to static data inside dlls is there  any way at all to get multiple instances of the static data  segment dgroup  no but  you can allocate real static data within code segments when you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap  you can forget most of what was written about memory management under 00 you have paged virtual memory you can lock every block without hampering the memory manager you can use far pointer everytime without always lock unlocking the memory block  an besides dlls are mostly just disguised exes that happen to be called by another task   karl   karlwgeitz hauptstr00 w0000 salzgitter 0 kwgeitzslinkescapede tel 0000000000 fax 0000000000 cis 000000000 bix geitzkwg  crosspoint v00   
   i also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call them are highly technical look around in the real world people dont want to grep and auck and ls l they just want to push the buttons and get their   you mean grep unix is case dependent and awk where did you get auck from  mark   
      im looking for a program or toolkit with which it is possible to create demonstrations very fast with a demonstration i mean a collection of screens the one that is looking to the demonstration should be able to make choices by pressing buttons to change screens hypertext     each screen will contain a question text or bitmap and a few answers buttons it should be possible to play music andor show animations film     ive heard of animator pro and visual basic but i dont know what these can do  autodesk animator is a good tool the one i like is show partnerfx if you want it i could give a copy to you i did a lot of advertising with it  it lets you create both graphics any resolution and text frames run it all as a film you can make choices and include music  i guess thats just what you need if youre really interested email me  vick victor friedmanvictorfseasuclaedu

  i think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users of ms products do not even know about internet and unix is that very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather comfortable abreviations they know and the abreviations have subtle differences between the different vendors while pc users tend to customize any windowing setup they can not do much with their  command line  you cant customize a command line interface  where have you been  i can change the prompt i can make aliases so someone like me who is used to say ls can type it on my dos machine and still get a directory listing and under unix if i dont like the command line interface i throw it out and get a different one csh bash ksh sh etc  so to most of the computer users in the world ms product symbolize quality ms has made their life easier and more productive and to them that is quality they do not care about what innovative things ms has done other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot easier you may know better than most computer users in this world but that will not change their perception  this is true  face it until unix come up with a decent gui that is available to all variations of unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream of computer users we here on the net are not mainstream computer users  a decent gui for all variations of unix lessee what about motif or the stuff from mit twm comes to mind those are pretty standard heck an xwindows program runs like it likes to  all the end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows with the mouse and since it is a gui its graphical and a bit easier to figure out something the windows people have been pressing down our throats for some time now  the thing i fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users running windows all flavors and the other power users running unix and other more advanced oses at least right now dos is still pretty much king i can bring a copy of my latest whizbang programming demo over to my friends house and since we both run dos he can enjoy it too  agriergompersgompersedu or tfinncrashctscom preferred

    the microsoft windows device driver kit ddk documentation blurb states that the user must separately acquire the microsoft windows software development kit sdk which contains the windows tools to build the drivers if we are using borland c with application frameworks is this necessary we also have a copy of the microsoft press programmers reference library books which normally comes with the sdk and microsoft macro assembler 00 why is the sdk neccessary for development of virtual device drivers    steven murray     posted on behalf of brian davies

  in the newer versions of norton backup for windows 00 at least there is an emergency disk which will allow you to restore from tape without reinstalling doswindows i understand its sort of cumbersome to use but not nearly as much as reinstalling everything      steven a mccluney              better to remain silent and be       sam0000chensun0mtamuedu      thought a fool than to speak and                                     remove all doubts                 i can hardly speak for myself

  youre right  you cannot read or write a mac or apple ii 000k 00 disk or apple ii 000 disk without extra hardware however mac 000mb disks can be read and written in a pc 00 hd drive with software only   this should probably be added to every pc and mac faq file it sure gets asked enough  i agree that this should be added to some sort of faq list  but we have strayed from the original topic  our computer environment is pretty split between macs and pcs i am lucky and get to have both on my desk  but there are people who have pcs and need to share data with the mac users here  the mac users have no problems because of package called dos mounter which automatically lets the mac read dos disks natively  for the pc there is no equivilant that i know of  both macette and macsee have been  inconsistant under the dos platform and requires you to perform the activity in a dos program to selectively transport the files  the question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into windows like a dll that will interpret the reading of a mac disk when it is  in a pc and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs  it is quite clear that this would only be available for the 000mb flopies    tj fiske  tfiskequalcommcom  
   my windows 00 installation has somehow gone awry  whenever i try to run windows now the logo comes up ok but when it tries to enter windows itself the screen gets totally screwed up as if its in the wrong graphics mode or something  its completely illegible although functional as i can still exit to dos with an alte return combination  i tried to reinstall windows again but if you recall halfway through the installation process install takes you into windows and there my graphics problem surfaces again so i cannot complete the reinstallation  all this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my configsys and autoexecbat have been restored to what they were before this problem cropped up  im running a 00000dx with a diamond stealth vram ive resinstalled the stealth video drivers again but with no luck  im also using qemm and stacker 00 but windows is installed on an unstacked partition  and of course it worked perfectly before  any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated  thanks  hutch   
  so i think there are 0 possibilities     0 im right  if my disk really crashes i would at least have to       reinstall dos and windows to get the backup program working  using the software youre using i agree with you there  what i did i installed dos windows and cpbackup functionally the same as your norton for the purposes of this discussion and used the  dos backup command on just that much  to restore i boot to the  system diskette and use dos restore to read in that much then boot to windows and restore my full backups using cpb norton in your case overwriting what ive just restored  that allows me to keep this skeletal windows essentially unchanged with all my customization on the real copy done using the 0rdparty backup utility     0 im wrong  there is an easy way to make a mirror of a hard disk       that can easily restore its state from scratch  seems possible if you can put skeletal versions of dos and your backup utility on a system floppy  then you could restore it all on one go     martin lodahlsystems analyst capacity planning pacificbell   malodahpacbellcom      sacramento ca usa            0000000000      if its good for ancient druids runnin nekkid through the wuids      drinkin strange fermented fluids its good enough for me  unk

  i have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week if you do get multiple copies my apologies  here is a challenge to microsoft or microsort supporters to defend the pathetic state of dos 0 as an upgrade distribution  it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of upgrading to dos 0 that i have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it  my envorinment   ti travelmate 0000 winsx 000sx00 0m ram 000m disk system bios version 000 000000 by texas instruments clgd0000 vga bios v 000 a0 by cirrus logic  quadtel advance power manager batterypro v b000 by texas instruments smart drive cache win00dos0 parameters 0000 0000 a b windows benchmark winbenchtm v 000 000000 by zd labs  after updgrading to dos 0 i could not understand why certain things became so slow especially after i decided to try dblspace  in the process of finding out why i discovered some interesting things   disk performance with double space and smart drive   while most things did not appear to slow down most of the time certain applications appeared to run very much slower  what was interesting is that commands like chkdsk and defrag were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards  i suspected double space ds and decided to measure its impact on my system using winbenchtm  the real disk winmark of 00000 for the original system as shipped from factory with dos 0 and windowws 00 became 00000 when upgraded to dos 0 with ds  thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than 00 percent which did not really surprise me because i knew that ds compression must cost something  specifically for short sequential reads up to 000 bytes ds actually improves transfer rates by about 00 because cpu being faster than io more cpu cycles needed for ds is more than compensated by savings in io cycles  however for all other cases particularly large random writes the transfers take up to three times as long  while the performance depends on the type of access ie random or sequential small or large transfer units on the average based on winbenchs assumptions the disk slows down to half its speed  the tests alone done in real mode see winbench and with smartdrv on do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like there is no noticable difference in performance or even that it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and slow disk io  this explained why some applications ran markedly slower but not why chkdsk and defrag the latter especially too so long   double space and windows   dblspace will not run at all from within windows not even if you wanted to only to get information not modify anything or for that matter even check on its usage  try fasthelp dblspace in a dos box within windows and you will see what i mean from the error message you get  how narrow minded can a programer get i wonder  yes this information can be obtained through the mstoolsdd addon to file manager but this mstools dll does not understand a compressed floppy  use the dos 0 supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to   dos 0 defragmenter is incompatible with ti apm   defragmentation seemed to take too much time  even so i waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm this confirmation dblspace def command for the 000m drive should take no more than 00 seconds much faster on other defragmenters i have used but it took 00 minutes  i discovered that if i moved the mouse defragmentation checking ran faster the  figure ticked more rapidly  it dawned on me that this had to do with tis battery saver advanced power management apm module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the cpu is idle and it obviously thought ds defragmentation was an idle process  after disabling the tis power saver this operation took only 00 seconds   microsft programmers think ti0000 and gateway nomad users are idiots   in the readmetxt file you can find the the following  running microsoft backup with ti0000 and gateway nomad computers  to avoid a conflict between the turbo feature and microsoft backup for windows or msdos add a l0 switch to the device command in your configsys that loads the batterypro file or before you run microsoft backup type setpower l0 at the command prompt  if you checked tis manual on the l0 option you will realise that it means disable all power saving features of your notebook  why would anyone want to run a driver disabled  as i have found out not only does tis power management interfere with microsoft backup as the readmetxt claims but chkdsk and dblspace and who knows what else are crippled by the tis power saver  it is obvious that there is not such thing as apm specifications  if there indeed is such a thing then either microsoft programmers or ti programmers dont know how to read these specifications  you dont have to guess as to who are the idiots  by the way if you run the advance power management utility powerexe in dos0 when you check the status it says  power management status  setting   adv max cpu idle 00 of time  this figure of 00 seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when i am running nothing windows with only program manager in iconised form  does that mean that windows takes up 00 of my cpu all for itself and that i have at best only 00 left for useful work  is such an overhead justified  whether or not windows is an operating system or just another user interface  in dos alone it reports 00 idle time  looks like windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that i like my students to study as the classical negative example of our times   microsoft programmers do not know batch programming   i like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this  set pathcdos  set pathcetcbinpathcbin  set pathcetcwindowspathcwindows  set pathpathcbccbin  set pathpathmouse  even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one ie cdos dos 0 installation program modifes each and every path statement and prepends cdos to its value  as a result my resultant path has so many doss  if the installation program wanted to remove the old dos path and add the new dos path clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old dos directory and replace it by the new dos path even this should only be done if the new dos is installed in a directory different from the old one being upgraded  instead the microsoft programmer if you can call this person one decided to meddle every path statement i had in the autoexec and prepend dos to the value  i wonder if microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process  i started a thread on this when dos 0 came up and the microsoft representative in singapore called me about this poster  in fact he specifically said his us counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet  now that has not changed one bit  in fact if you have a path statement with path already in it is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason  as another example of the inability of microsoft programmers to understand batch programming  i had the mouse driver invoked as  set mousecetcmouse set pathpathmouse loadhigh mousemousecom  guess what memmaker did  it replaced the last statement with  lh  cetcmousemousecom  why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with lh and its parameters without touching the rest of the line i do not understand   dos 0 software quality   dos 0 is the only operating system i know in which under normal usage you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the commands that come with it  i am deliberately being cryptic about this  i challenge microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it  if they dont within a week i will post how you can create this ghost file  surely if i can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice i am sure two dozen microsoft idiot programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it  that is what i was told how microsoft tests the quality of their products  i think it is funny that microsoft has found ways to test quality when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested but can only be built into the product  no wonder they cannot provide any form of guarantees on their products not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair  also if you run dblspace def often enough repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented you may get errors that was created by the defragmenters  i got my iosys file size error and it got truncated when i did the chkdsk  this happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since  microsft

       theres one thing about windows that really frosts me i have 00mb of ram installed in my system i use a 0mb 00mb under windows diskcache and a 0mb permanent swap file       while i can never fill the memory up i still have problems sometimes because i run out of gdi resources what gives i think windows could manage these resources a little better  are you using windows 00 or 00 if youre still on 00 00 devotes about twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently if 00 you might use one of the resource monitors such as the one that comes with the windows 00 resource kit or one of the many shareware ones available to see which programs are hogging the resources every icon internal graphics brush etc in every program running uses a certain amount of this limited memory area also some dont give it back when theyre finished  lamont downs downsnevadaedu

  all icons in program manager are aliases is that explicit  enough  apparently not many people complain about the confusion that results from the filemanagerprogman split its just a basic flaw  besides what about the control panel icons where are all those little files  
  well you may think that but you are wrong  ah the joys of networking i just hope that you forgot the   if you dont like the file manager dont use it  i dont i use ndw  i like the more modular nature of windoze  if you like things to be modular i think you would love system 0 instead of adding a line to your autoexecbat you just drop the icon into the extensions folder  just because one has had ignorance sold to one by the evil  fruit empire one is not forbidden to learn about ones file  system below the level of the gui  im still working on that one

  flangleyrhccsvaxsfasuedu writes    stuff deld for bandwidths sake  why  sigh  if you dont have more than 00mbs of memory using a ramdrive with windows is a waste of memory  windows will access upto 00mb ram better as memory  as to why what you did didnt work it is because driveletters and paths are stored inside the grouppifini files  all of the sudden things went from drive c to drive e  however if you wanted to copy an application up to the ramdrive and resetup it up that should work normally but as previously stated this will only hurt things unless youve got more than 00mbs of ram and are using whats above 00 as the ramdrive  i personally have 00mbs of ram and run a 0mb ramdrive with a great deal of success  however if you are looking to speed up windows the three things ive noted that work the best are 0 a graphics accellerator card 0 a coprocessor even an emulator helps 0 some other diskcache besides smartdrive ive tried several    and lightning for windows and norton cache give me major    headaches as well  i think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the significant amount of disk access that windows does on startup  its like its trying to its bit in wearing the damn drive out  i estimate its only reading a mb of programs  data but from the performance the drive gives it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive my drive is however regularily compressed  what is it that takes so much fuss  perhaps if ms  would take the trouble to optimize this startup process less people would  be wanting to find a solution themselves  
  there is a free unix linux that has cc c fortran  f0c  xwindows and many other features besides with a large number of utilities that can be optionally added and there is also a free 000bsd i believe both these unixs are quite robust you can check out composlinux  i dunno about linux but for 000bsd dont forget networking well tested at that nfs a fast incredibly stable filesystem and the list goes on  0  for us 000bsd folk look in compos000bsd     chris moderator of compos000bsdannounce antipolitician and sometime evangelist  chris g demetriou                                    cgdcsberkeleyedu     000bsd as depth first search whenever you go to fix something you        find that 0 more things are actually broken  adam glass  
   is anyone aware of existing ipxnetx software for windowsnt or is attachment to netware a future release please respond to internet mail raymakerbcmtmcedu thanks   i believe the beta version of the service is available via ftp on  ftpcicaindianaedu in pubpcwin0nt called something like nwntzip  there is an index ascii file there which lists the programs in that directory and what they do  unfortunately this beta will also disable netbeui and tcpip over your primary nic so if you really want to run it get yourself an extra nic and bind it to that    otherwise wait for next release like i am  adriene

  alcolhpcom al devilbiss writes  jorgeerexeastsuncom jorge lach  sun bos hardware writes  is there any ftp site that carries winbench results for different graphics  cards in excel xls format what is the latest version of winbench and  how do they differ is the source available and has anybody try to port it to  xwindow at least in a way that will make comparisons possible   on ftpcicaindianaedu in pubpcwin0miscwinadvzip is a writeup by steve gibson of infoworld with winbench 000 and a number of other  benchmark results for nine isa and four vlb video cards  this is a  very current upload and is likely to have any card youre currently  giving serious consideration  not in xls format  latest version of winbench that i know of is ver 000  i believe they try to maintain the same rating scale between versions and new versions are released to defeat the lastest coding tricks put in by driver programmers to beat the benchmarks  dont know on the last one  and why they are considering using winbench as a test they may want to read everything steve gibson has said on the subject in his infoworld column the past couple of month  in short virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the winbench suite  so the winbench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks  in the last pcmagazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators and admitted that many of them cheated on winbench  interestingly they allowed one type of cheating behaviour caching for bitblt operations no matter how unreal yet did not allow a couple of other types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used  at least one card was eliminated from the editors choice because of cheating on the benchmark  al devilbiss alcolhpcom  
   apparently not many people complain about the confusion that results from the filemanagerprogman split its just a basic flaw  i have one thing to say why does everyone say that spliting them up is such a bad thing  i actually like my program launcher and file manager do be seperate it make things easier to figure out i mean take a look  at os0s wps no flames i personally hate it cause i just have too much trouble figuring out how to do simple things like file copy  and dont say just drag the icon cause i hate icons in the first place i have too much trouble telling what all those little push buttons mean i want file copy etc   although i know im in the minority      swyattbrahmsudeledu   no disclaimeri blame everything on someone else     
  ok so if everyone is cheating is there any tests that run some  macro to load a huge drawing etc on the same machine that might  then tell us what the real world results are  i mean run the tests on the same machine with different video cards running word excel or something like that to see how fast the cards are     swyattbrahmsudeledu   no disclaimeri blame everything on someone else     
  jpaparelcsulowelledu joseph paparella writes  i am having a problem configuring the mouse in windows to use com0 with irq0  com0 and com0 are being used to support two 00 hour bbs lines  there you go  com0 and com0 use the same irq therefore you cant use a mouse on com0 and a modem on com0 or vice versa  its a limitation of dos  and in fact windows will not see a mouse on anything other than com0 or com0  accept this fact and either get a bus mouse or get a new computer  i would also like to know if it is possible to use the mouse on ports other than com0 or com0   no  the advice above applies  greg franklin frankliggasuugarizonaedu  
  nagelucsucoloradoedu kurt nagel writes  hi  im having a problem with amipro when writing equations  if the equation extends past a certain point on a line the whole thing disappears if i then try to delete the equation or cursor beyond the equation ami goes nuts  the line counter at the bottom of the screen increments repeatedly and the only way out is to ctrlatldel  if i have been unfortunate enough to save a document with one of these screwed up equations the document is basically trashed  although i have been able to fix them by going into an ascii editor and deleteing large chunks of the document  has anyone else experienced this  does lotus know about it and or have a patch  thanks in advance  kurt nagelfidocoloradoedu  i contacted lotus about this problem today  it has been reported previously and there is a fix  apparantly the problem only occurs when tab characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame  the work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding tab and use space to align the frame or use set frame where placed wno text wrap around  unforutnately once the page runon has occured you are hosed so the moral of the story is use only space characters to align equation frames  hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this  problem  kurt nagelfidocoloradoedu

  in composmswindowsmisc you write  while reading through the dos 00 book it states that the windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive  to make things compatable i removed my permanent swap file before starting the upgrade  however when all the dust settled and i go into windows it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was in the windows directory  my question is  how come the temporary swap files works ok with a compressed drive and the permanent one doesnt  you might want to look in windows faq for this one but here is my best explanation  but i cant guarantee that im not way off base  the permenant swap file is readwritten to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card  the controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital or something like that windows creates a file called spartpar in your windows directory that points to that file  it then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file  compressed disks are actually logical disks  these disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk  furthermore the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used  ie it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the bios level  because of this inbetween program windows cannot use direct methods to read from the logical disk  a permenant swap file is only there to reserve an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from dos  windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from dos to use that disk space i dont know if it does or doesntbut it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows  a temporary swap file is just a normal dos file that is accessed by windows via dos and the bios  if a disk compression program or other tsr is loaded the file access must go through dostsrs disk compressionand bios in order to be access ie never use a temporary swap filenever  more on permenent swap files  im sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested sizewindows will only use the size suggesteddo you want to create this swap file anyway or something like that  well a friend of mine robert called microsoft and asked them what and why what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 0  then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space  windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers  they also said that under absolutely no circumstancesnonewill windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size  wellthats what he  said  i call bull  if this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if its not going to use it  any takers  james  if this doesnt get to the net will someone post it for me  thanks

    im looking for a program that will let me use a windows common dialog box to select a file to use when running a dos app  basically i have several dos apps that i use now and then with different files  they all accept a file as a command line  parameter but the only way at least that i know of to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the pif file so that it prompts me for additional parameters at which point i type  in the file name    problems are  0 sometimes i cant remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager      and 0 im lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried  several directory levels deep  if anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this id appreciate it  thanks  tim   the net isnt organized enough to be considered an anarchy    reczekautarchacsubuffaloedu

  my understanding is that to copy files from one directory to another on   the same drive in file manager using a mouse you hold down the ctrl key   while dragging the file from one directorys window to the other  this   works for me about 00 of the time  the other 0 the file gets   moved rather than copied  anybody else encountered this   i tried to respond by email but all attempts bounced  the condition of the ctrl key before you press the mouse button makes no difference whatsoever  you have to be holding the ctrl key when you release the mouse button if you want to force a copy operation  heres a simple experiment  select a file and begin to drag it no ctrl key  notice that the files icon disappears from the listing window  now watch what happens to that icon as you press and release the ctrl key keeping the mouse button pressed all the while  in addition the icon that you are dragging will show a  while you are holding the ctrl key indicating that the file is being copied rather than moved   bob nichols att bell laboratories rnicholsihlpmihattcom

  hello      im investigating the purchase of an object oriented application framework  i have come across a few that look good    zapp 00 from inmark   zinc 00 from zinc software   cviews from liant   win from blaise  some considerations im using    being new to windows programming im from the unixx world the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important  however since im not adverse to learning the internals of windows programming the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one  i dont believe arbitrary levels of abstraction just for the sake of changing the api are valuable    since we will be developing for the 00bit windows nt system the memory management issues and issues particular to the windows 00 api are less important     we will probably buy another c class library something like toolsh or booch components from rational to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  allocators etc  so those features are not that important for this toolkit to have  the two that i have narrowed it down to are zapp and zinc they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media  i was wondering if anyone had any firsthand experience with any of these toolkits especially zapp and zinc  a couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are  zapp    seems to have the most extensive coverage of windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes   has new fancy 0dstyle controls available and support for custom controls   has a windows nt version essential   redirectable graphics displayoutput architecture useful for printing   sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize   seems to be the newcomer this could be an advantage in designing a better system   zinc    has a platform independent resource strategy  not too important for me right now   comes with a interface builder tool   has a windows nt version essential   seems to have been around longer more mature but grew up out of a dos version     had a better demo   both have source code availability options both are lacking ole support neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff   any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated  thanks   brett harper   brettharpercimlinccom

   write over the licensed to but you cant change the name underneth it  i  think if you wish to change this you would have to be a pirate and were not  going to promote that here    not so my computer was supplied with my name in an interesting mix of upper and lower case and my workplace mistyped im getting fed up with being cmyearsley at keel unversity it took me 00  phone calls to the supplier to get the computer working at all i really cant face tackling them again   chris  
   i had a similar problem  try changing the netmask to 0000 or 0000000000  tommy  
  my suggestion would be to contact microsoft about the video0windows sdk you would need to call developer services at 0000000000 extension 00000 from 000am to 000pm pacific time   
  greetings  i am looking pro a win 00 printer driver for the panasonic laser printer kxp0000 i am not sure about the order of the first letters in the name but the numbers are right and they are important i have found  drivers for panasonic printers 0000 and so on but i think there should be drivers available where the 0000 model is included   grateful for any help     kjellhutfi kjellniksulahutfikjellvipunenhutfi

  you have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in windows than in dos  regardless of what communication software you are using  try the following    0 turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to  the        cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine        it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters     0 use a different uart for your serial line  the old uarts 0000 or 00000        can only buffer one character internally  the new uarts 00000 can        buffer 00 which should be plenty for most situations  you can run        windowsmsdexe to find out what uart is on the machine  ron  
  rmohnsvaxclarkuedu writes  windows nt is a giant windows operating system  unline win00 it does not  run on top of dos  it is its own os with billy gates assures us true  multitaskingmultithreading meets dod security specs will run win00  programs as well as dos programs has multiprocessor support and is primarily a server program  its overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users  correction  all billy is promising is that it will run most windows 00 programs and the major dos programs  do not expect everything you have to run under nt unless all you have are current ms apps

   as the subjects says windows 00 keeps crashing givinh me gpf on me of   late  it was never a very stable package but now it seems to crash every   day  the worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently ie i   cant reproduce crashes and they are not always gpfs in the same   application sometimes i can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error but other times windows acts very strange and i   need to reboot  some background  i have a leading edge 000sx00 with phoenix bios  when i   first got it it had 0mg of memory  it ran windows fine not too many   gpfs  then a couple of weekends ago i installed lotus 000 for windows   with atm a game card and an additional 0  0mg simms  the leading edge   machine is kind of strange in that it has the ide controler built into   the motherboard the cpu is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the simms it uses are macintosh simms apparently i   was told that the leading edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board  the original 0mg 00ns simms where of the 0 chip variety from   samsung and the ones i installed are 0 chip simms they are recognized   fine by the bios ram check the game card is a generic 00 gamecard  the reason why i mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctlaltdel still leaves   the machine kind of flaky but turning it on and off doesnt   i havent tried taking out the ram or the game card because as i said   these gpf are not reproducible at will  i have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then i might get 0 or so gpfs   in the sppace of 00 minutes  what can i do  this situation is most annoying are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware do you think that this might be a software   problem ie emm000 etc if it helps i have manage to get gpfs on after   dark quicken paint shop pro a lot of them have been in userexe or   gdiexe  any help is truly appreciated  eric  eboscousoraclecom

   when i first setup windows using the self load mode it grabbed about 00 megs of swap file space my 000 meg hd was nearly empty at that time i deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded now my hd is nearly full and windows just took 0 megs  one of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous nonfragmented space  i suspect that is more responsible for the difference than the amount of free disk in your case  i have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your permanent swap file the same size as your regular ram size  i have 0 megs of ram and windows took 0 meg perm swap file  works very well in fact with my available hd space about 00 megs it wont let me make the swap file any bigger you should change your virtual mem swap file to 0 megs i think that is what you said your ram was  it depends on what you are running  we had to increase our swap file i think it is now 00mb when some applications couldnt run without everything else closed    mike lipsie                                work mlipsiecamerlcom mitsubishi electronic research laboratory  home mikeldosbearsuucp

who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here  using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the  modemhe has a 00000 modem on a 000 00 mhz machine  i cant  see it having trouble keeping up  his pcplus for dos works great  re what to do after the high speed modem arrives       edition 00 apr 00  this article applies only to windows 00 and 00 and not to nt os0 or dos apps not running under windows  one of the unadvertised limitations of most current windows pcs is that their rs000c serial com performance is seriously deficient  almost everyone who purchases a highspeed modem v00bis v00 pep or hst discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming fax at 0000 after upgrading the modem  overrun and retry errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or fax program  if the transfer completes at all it may take even longer than with the old 0000bps modem   there are three reasons for the problem  0 the universal asynchronous receivertransmitters uarts used in most    pcs are primitive ns0000 devices with singlebyte fifo buffers  if the    operating systemdriver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the fifo and    the previous one is lost  dos being a fairly singleminded    environment during datacomm can usually keep up windows cant  0 windows has more operating system overhead than plain dos and    interrupts often take longer to service  overruns are much more likely    than under dos  as soon as you report to your pcmodem vendor that you    are losing data you may be advised that you need to upgrade to a    00000 more likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue  youll get no useful advice at all  most of the    storefront and mailorder sources i spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term 00000 and many didnt even    know what a uart was  0 even your pc has ns00000a uarts and ps0s do or if you can upgrade    your mothercom board or add a new com board you may still experience    errors and overruns because the standard microsoft windows com drivers    dont take full advantage of the 00000  windows 00 is improved in this    regard over 00 but i still recommend a driver upgrade  applications    like procommwin which is what i use cannot get around this problem    by themselves  if you have a modem card you may not have a problem as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the uart and avoid overrunning it however i wouldnt want to bet that the card designers were that clever and will insist on a 00000 uart if i ever buy a modem card  some modem cards dont even have conventional uarts but if they are to work with standard windows drivers they need to simulate one use msdexe below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to be   the hardware situation  the uarts on most pc com ports are based on national semiconductor ns0000 or ns00000 chips or megacells inside vlsi chips where you cant replace them  you can id the uart type on your system by running the microsoft diagnostic program windowsmsdexe  be sure to run it in dos before bringing up windows   the windows serial api may prevent msd from accurately identifying a 00000 if you run it from a windows dos prompt  the ns00000 uart has separate 00byte transmit and receive fifos with configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to 000000 bps although with current modem technology theres no point in pushing your luck by going over 000000 bps the 00000 has shorted access cycle times than the 00000 or 0000  the 00000 also has dma capability but it is not clear that any pc drivers ever use this  for more technical info see national semiconductor application note an000  so what uart component do you have  try to locate the uart on your mother board multifunction io card com board or isamca modem card  if you cant find a socketed component with the numbers 0000 or 00000 your com ports are probably buried in vlsi and you wont be able to perform a chip replacement  if you can disable your vlsi com ports as i chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket com board  if you have one or more socketed 0000 or 00000 chips you can buy plugin ns00000afn or pc00c000cn low power cmos version ics from several suppliers typically for 0 to 00 each  the n chip is the normal 00pin dualinline package  other styles are available but avoid any ns00000 chips without the a the 00c000c are presumably all ok  early ns chips have bugs although national will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free  clone chips are available from various ic makers other than national  the manual for the turbocom drivers states support for the following apparently equivalent chips national semiconductor 00000a 00000 00000 chipstechnology       00c000 texas instruments

00 systems ibm reportedly will upgrade them  if you dont have socketed 000000000 chips youll need to buy an after market com or multifunction board if this is a modem card situation you may be hosed to add a new com or multifunction card youll need to either disable the com00 ports you are replacing or reassign them to com00 although watch out for irq conflicts without turbocom  although cheaper

except jdr  meanwhile back at the mct card from jdr i only needed two serial ports and am running out of irqs on my pc so i disabled my builtin vlsibased 0000 ports however with the turbocom driver below i could have set the internals as com0 and 0 using irq sharing   the software situation  simply upgrading to 00000 uarts will not completely solve common overrun problems  the standard ms serial drivers dont take full advantage of the 00000 the windows 00 drivers are even less capable and the windows 00 drivers have the following limitations   they enable only the receive fifo and only at rates above 0000 bps   they never enable the transmit fifo which  results in an interrupt    rate of 00x during uploads   they set the trigger level at 00 bytes too high  its easy for 0    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the fifo   the ports menu of the control panel only allows speeds up to 00000    with a v00bis modem  sparse data and text can easily compress 00    or more suggesting that a host dte connect rate of 00000 bps would    be effective   the api wont accept rates above cbr000000   the api wont let dos programs know there is a 00000 there and even    if it did dos programs that arent 00000aware get little benefit    from a 00000 port with the standard drivers   they dont allow irq sharing for com00   the bios doesnt initialize com00 properly in many systems   windows provides no workaround for apps that dont provide port    speed options above 00000 bps  these problems are reportedly not solved in windows nt or dos 00 and may or may not be addressed in any windows releases after 00 but before 00 rumors suggest they may be solved in windows 00  you can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of turbocom current version 00 from  bioengineering research pacific commware division 000 beacon hill lane ashland  or   000000000 000 0000000 voice 000 0000000 fax 000 0000000 bbs mcimail    0000000 compuserve 00000000  price was around 00 as i recall  bioeng is not set up to accept credit cards so i had to send a check  egghead and 0000software list turbocom but as far as i know they dont stock it  bio is not a software company per se  they apparently needed reliable hispeed serial connections for an inhouse instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a market for it revised it to be a general purpose com driver suite they recently upgraded it for windows 00  it is runtime licensed  i now have my host dte connect rate set to 00000 bps most of  my datacomm apps and i am having zero problems with downloads i routinely see transfer rates that exceed 0000 bps i am also using 000000 bps when linking an hp00lx to my pc with lossless bidirectional io uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts are still using antique uarts and drivers  note that 00000 is still the highest rate that the windows 00 port menu in control panel will allow in configuring a com port  turbocom gets around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real uart rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the windows apis and dialog boxes  i also have ctsrts hardware flow control enabled and i suggest that you do the same  even if you only ever transfer 0bit ascii data xonxoff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control  the informal dec standard for xonxoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 00 yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the xoff from the receiving system or device  the 00 byte fifo in the 00000 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on xonxoff  a wellrespected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 00000s cant really do ctsrts all by itself in the doswindows environment so using data rates above 000000 may still be risky  even with hardware flow control a 00000 with turbocom can still experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress if this is your situation you may need to buy a coprocessed com board but this will cost you more than a 00000turbocom upgrade  a review of two such boards and a review of turbocom can be found in the feb00 issue of windows sources magazine i suggest trying a 00000turbocom upgrade first and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a power user whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems   closing soapbox comments  the state of rs000c serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry  because it is the oldest standard io interface the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies  the design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art in my last job with a major workstation vendor i lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system  that family of machines was subsequently introduced with 00000 ports  however this is the exception  few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent io  you may as well learn what you can about serial io because this situation shows no sign of improving soon  when vfast arrives i expect cries of outrage from windows users worldwide whose 0000 pcs sort of work today with v00 but will fail miserably with vfast  without a hardwarebuffered uart like the 00000 and without software drivers that use that uart to best advantage a vfast modem will be a waste of money  regards

  while there are too many ps clones to count some of which are quite poor trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience three questions come to mid real quick for something like this  qwhich version of adobe ps will we clone aside from the level 0 and level 0 issues adobe has in the past released new code that incorporates modificationsupgradesfixes just as all other software vendors do the level 0 stuff may seem sound now but i assure youchanges will become more frequent as their customer list begins to dwindle in the face of competition this allows them to shift people to maintenance as well as design efforts for level 0  qdo we duplicate the bugs or do we make it work correctly from the laserwriter to the laserjet 0 there have been bugs if i had a number to call at hp or adobe theyld have heard from me deciding which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate  qdo we follow the red book or do we follow someones implementation without a doubt there are differences between the red book and adobes ps with level 0 many issues have been refined but the red book does leave big big holes in the implementation specific stuff it would be nice it the red bood at least pined things down enough so that two different implementations of adobes ps dont do the exact opposite given an identical set of conditions  qpscriptdrv having done a lot of ps clone testing myself the unfortunate side of testing is the limited number of sources for test files the primary source we use is genoa and having characterizes their 0000 ps ats files 0000 of them over half are taken from pscriptdrv it may not ideal but the ats files are what the printer vendors use im sure that adobe uses them too but adobes output is by definition correct even if its wrong  yes there are some very poor clones weve seen them here at rastek a sub of genicom which has its own clone called geniscript some are poor for lack of design some are poor because they followed the red book and some are poor because the vendors dont know what ps is  don newbolddonrastekcom

  i just installed a new truetype font under mswindows 00 but though all the applications display the font correctly on the screen quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly on a laserjet 0  nonpostscript printer  when i use the font in coreldraw the document prints correctly so i assume coreldraw knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer  but when i use the windows accessory write the printer prints square boxes in place of the characters of the new font yet write does display the font correctly on the screen  i looked through all the windows and laserjet manuals but got nowhere all of them just make the statement that truetype fonts will print exactly as you see them on the screenso i assume windows knows that a font has to be downloaded automaticallybut how to make it do that  appreciate any help

  after setting up windows for using my cirrus logic 0000 vlb graphicscard it moved a normal window from one place to another  what i was wondering why is it not using the bitblt  engine which is suuposed to be on the chip  how are the experiences here have i done something wrong   the 0000 has its own set of drivers you may be using the drivers intended for the 0000 or 0000 by mistake  be sure you have the 0000 driver version 00  i installed the mswin 00 multiresolution drivers which where supplied  with the card   dont quote me on this one but id steer clear of the multi resolution driver that allows you to change resolution without exiting windows  i think its buggy  also if there are newhopefully faster drrivers around i would love to  how to get hold of them  ftp or whatsoever    version 00 drivers are due to be release by cirrus soon unfortunately their not available via ftp you have to dial up their bbs in the usa  i do this from nz using a 000k modem to cut down on phone bills  it took me around 0 minutes to  download the v00 driver   good luck    andy gardner wellington new zealand te whanganuiatara aotearoa

  i just installed a new truetype font under mswindows 00 but though all the applications display the font correctly on the screen quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly on a laserjet 0  nonpostscript printer  but when i use the windows accessory write the printer prints square boxes in place of the characters of the new font yet write does display the font correctly on the screen  this is a common problem with highly complex truetype fonts  microsoft admits to a problem with older versions of the postscript printer driver but ive found it to be pretty generic  you can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter outlinethreshold in the truetype section of winini  this entry specifies the number of pelsperem at which windows will render truetype fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap fonts  the default is 000  ive generally been able to get fonts to work by setting outlinethreshold000  depending on your printer resolution and the point size you are using you may need a different value  the windows resource kit warns against going above 000  presumably that might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something    im not smiling   bob nichols att bell laboratories rnicholsihlpmihattcom

  hi there im having a bizarre video problem within windows 00  i have a 000 with a gvga00 video board  ive been using the standard windows vga driver with other similarly configured computers  i am thinking that my problem is with the way windows refreshes its screen  the problem is that once windows has been envoked the colors start changing themselves  at first i thought it was hardware but if you open a full screen dos program from within the windows session you dont have any problems until you get back to windows  however when you initially return to windows the original colors get refreshed properly  also it is not a uniform color change  so if you are in solitaire the design on the back of the card maintains its original color scheme but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey then blue etc  the color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purpleish black  if you pop out to dos and exit back to windows  the screen gets refreshed again  if i dont log into windows and just do dos things from the novell network everything is fine  i originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine i had just finished configuring then from the net to this machine  when i ran into problems i deleted everything on this machine and the net and tried bouncing it again  when that didnt work i tried reloading windows to no avail  any thoughts on things to check out  i am totally baffled  thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction  linda cornell lcornelluwashingtonedu uw office of research  
      somewhere in this thread it has been said that windows nt tm is a     multiuser os as well as multithreading etc  i certainly havent    seen this to be the case  there are seperate accounts for each person    and even seperate directories if that is desired  i dont see an     implentation of simultaneuos use though     scott  it certainly is multiuser what i have seen from the march beta is that it doesnt yet come with the stuff which exploits multiuser features i remember somebody from ms stating that it doesnt allow two users share one gui my interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and rpc based stuff you want   i believe ftp and rlogin deamons for nt systems will come from third party somebody already has a beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net there is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on unix for remote logins   in general i liked nt when i checked it out it slow compared to win00 just like any other real os the beta version although being slow botts up much faster than my sun workstation windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than x windows i believe bill gates was right when he stated that nt was not for everybody after playing around with it for a while i was convinced if i owned a busines using a business computer from ibm or some other established vendor i would consider moving to nt platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution if you are running sql servers etc it provides the robustness such an application requires   on the other hand if you like your dos games more or less forget about nt you can always boot to dos  but in general that defeats the purpose of using nt most of nts features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you cant reboot your machine at will for personal use i would rather wait for the win00 based windows release whatever you name it than jump to nt bandwagon i expect most applications will keep on using win00 until win00 becomes widely available    sadun anik u of illinois at urbanachampaign center for reliable and highperformance computing email anikcrhcuiucedu

   dear friend   the risc means reduced instruction set computer the risc usually has  small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase  the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some books about computer architecture for more information about risc  hmm not that i am an authority on risc  but i clearly remember reading that the instruction set on risc cpus is rather large the difference is in addressing modes  risc instruction sets are not as orthogonal is cisc                 some people say its fun but i think its very serious                                   eugenemacadammpcemqeduau

   i am considering buying borlands paradox for windows since i would like to use a database with windows i dont haveuse one yet for both workhome use  i would like to advantage of borlands 00000 until april 00 offer if this package is everything that borland claims it to be  so i was wondering  has anybody used this andor have any opinions   tom belmonte  if you are interested in a program which is very easy to use i strongly  suggest approach 00  it is extremely easy to use make reports etc  i own both it and paradox and i almost never use paradox  if you need to  build up a complicated application then paradox is the way to go  i have heard horror stories about the access programming being extremely cryptic since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff work home use and you have not used a database before i recommend approach  i  have found only one small thing which i would like it to do more easily i have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering  to permanently reorder to  use the old dbase iii command the records requires sorting the records  appropriately no problem since i almost always use them in this order exporting the database to another database which can still be an approach  database and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename  this is a small weakness considering the other items i really  like about approach  it is also a little slower than paradox other than  the loading paradox takes forever and a minute to load  paradox also  takes a lot of memory both hard disk around 00mb and ram  greg bishop bishopbaeyerchemfsuedu

  i am a novice at best in working with pc networks and am in the process of planning a small accounting system for a small business  the particular need in this case is for three machines each in a different office of the same building each having access to a windowsbased accounting system  my first thought is to set up ms windows for workgroups on each of the machines likely a 000 and two 000s along with the appropriate ethernet cards and cabling that come with the windows for workgroups starter kit one additional user kit will be necessary  it then seems logical to purchase a simple multiuser accounting system along the lines of daceasy or myob and fire it all up  the 000 will more or less act as server with a reportcheck printer attached to it cable runs of 0000 feet will be necessary for this setup  well this all seems too easy to me  would any of you network gurus out there tell me if i am out of my mind here  any and all suggestions however trivial will be immensely appreciated  my apologies if this has been brought up before  thanks  john   john e martin    jemartinnyxcsduedu      university of puget sound 00     kent wa     formerly martinupsedu   seinfeldsupersonicsrushbelafleck   john e martin    jemartinnyxcsduedu      university of puget sound 00     kent wa     formerly martinupsedu   seinfeldsupersonicsbcrushdweckl

  wrote    i just got a copy of tobias managing your money v00  i have quicken 0  and its wonderful for some things but mym seems to have some features  that q0 doesnt  for example q0 doesnt seem to be able to handle  monthly automatic deductions from a checking account you know a  monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from  my checking account  or is there something that im not doing right  and q0 can actually do that    hi      i have never used mym so i can not help you with the comparison of the two products  i am however  a devoted quicken user and i can tell you how to set up the weekly monthly quarterly yearly transactions  first use the memorize feature ctrlm to record the recurring transactions  next define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used ie monthly  quicken willcan not automatically make the transactions for you but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once  additionally if you are using the bill minder it will remind you when each transaction group is due  for example you could have three transaction groups  one for payments at the beginning of the month middle of the month and one for quarterly payments  i hope this helps  mike

  walther id have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering id only suggest using the color screen if it does 000000 without flickering if this is not too small for your tastes at a 00 personally id prefer the monoscreen as i always have quite a few windows open if you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color surplus is worth trading in  the smaller size if you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors i used a 00 mono screen worst of both worlds and was surprised how the colors looked i choose on a color screen   regards olaf winkelhake  
  i have heard many things about the ati ultra pro card some have been positive but most are negative could people please confirm these  i am interested in the eisa version in particular  0 the card does not work in a system with 00m ram  0 the card works in a 00m system with some switches    set but it is much slower  0 the card is interlaced in its 00bit truecolour modes  0 the latest build 00 drivers still do not work in many    cases  0 this card is the fastest full colour card for the money  0 this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread   thanks for your feedback i will summarize  al    alan walford     eos systems inc vancouverbc canada  tel 0000000000 aeweosvcrwimseybcca           or        uunetwimseybccaeosvcraew    
  i would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few  questions about windows for workgroups  i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver 00 i am considering moving all our machines to w0wg  q0  how much conventional ram does w0wg use over and above the      driver for the network card  q0  if i have a novell ne0000 card are the lsl and ipx drivers      still needed  q0  does w0wg do a license check over the network to ensure each      machine is running its own licenced copy of w0wg note i do      not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy      of w0wg for each of our machines it is just that i would like      to try it out first to see if it meets our needs returning one      opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies  q0  if you buy the upgrade to windows 00 for w0wg does it replace      all of win 00 as you install it or does it depend on current      win 00 files  q0  if i install windows nt on my server when it comes out will i have      any troubles with the w0wg machines  when i started this message i was going to ask only 0 questions but i got carried away ill stop now   i look forward to your replies  al    alan walford     eos systems inc vancouverbc canada  tel 0000000000 aeweosvcrwimseybcca           or        uunetwimseybccaeosvcraew    
  hi weve been having problems on a few setups when printing to a serial printer dmp or laser i have used works and windows write the output is ok from dos and if i send plain text output but anything fancy garbles or just doesnt output the exception is outputting to a lserjet 0 which appears to be fast enough receiving data not to bother about handshaking messages im sure im not alone in this ive tried most of the printnetwork manager options i can think of anyone had similar problems theyve cured and would like to tell me bout it thanks  john atherton      
  anyway is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs or can someone just give me their own personal impressions  maybe  pc magazine january 00 0000 had a review of several personal finance management programe as did pccomputing january 0000  pc world december 0000 also had articles about quicken and managing your money i can email you copies of these articles if you cant find them at your library  ive been using managing your money for several years and i have several friends who use quicken though ive not used it myself  my overall impression is that quicken is a financial accounts manager while managing your money will help you more completely manage your finances  here are some features that i believe managing your money and quicken share  the ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts checking savings charge cash or brokerage  you can reconcile your account statements with the records the program keeps  the ability to make a budget and track your spending against that budget  a checkfree module which will allow you to use the checkfree bill paying service to pay your bills via your modem  the ability to print checks on your printer  the ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments  the ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts up to date  i know managing your money can do this automatically via modem  quicken probably can as well but im not sure about it  the ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation programs   here are some features that i believe managing your money has that quicken does not  a tax prediction module  this looks at your accounts and budget to predict your tax liability for the coming year  its usefull to fine tune your withholding so uncle sam doesnt get his due too early  an insurance and vital records module  this is a place to keep records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records it can also compute your life expectancy  a financial analysis module  this computes compound interest  effects of inflation loan payments term or interest yield to maturity for bonds savings account yields days between dates and loan amortization schedules  it also has functions to help you  decide whether to refinance your mortgage whether you can afford a particular home whether a particular rental property is a good investment whether you should buy lease or rent and whether a particular investments cash flow is adequate for your situation this module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping your kids with their tuition    a net worth module  this is a place to record all your assets and liabilities  your net worth can be computed from this  information  any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules are automatically included here  a desk module  this includes a small word processor a card file you can use to store names addresses phone numbers and other vital information about friends and associates a perpetual calander a rudimentary calculator a todo list a reminder list an appointment list and a place to record your phone calls for those who need to track such things  your appointments reminders and todo list can be made to display automatically when you start the program  there are probably some things listed above that quicken has but im almost sure that quicken doesnt do everything ive listed  if im wrong im sure hordes of quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp  one thing that quicken has that managing your money does not yet have is a  windows version  meca software is rumored to be working on a windows version of managing your money for release late this year  i hope this information is of use to you  ive found managing your money to be a very usefull program for keeping my financial records  on the other hand i know many people who are equally as happy with quicken  if quicken has all the features you need or want id go with it if you find any of the managing your money features that quicken doesnt have to be useful i think its well worth the price

  hi    have you used mac system 0x or 0x if the answer is positive you would know if mswindows is a mature os  this is silly is unix a mature os depends on who you ask and how you define mature system 0 is if anything less mature than windows 00    days ago people doubted that mswindows is not a real os i can see why they have such question mswindows confuses many people microsoft simulated mac but it did a lousy job  for example  0 you can not create hierarchy groups there is no way to create a group     in a group if you know how please tell me  so why do you need something like behierarchic to create groups under the apple menu everyone knows that apple menu items are a ripoff of the program manager if you want a hierarchic program launcher there are lots available  0 uncomplete documentation its not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error  and this is easy on a mac give me a break having spent hours moving system extensions around and restarting the mac to see why a certain app crashes all the time i find this laughable  0 group deletingfile deleting     after deleting a group users have to use file manager to delete files     but if users forget to delete some related files the disk will be full     of nonsense files  oh great ever hear of aliases wonder why apple implemented them  0 share problem     once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language wo good editor there will be a sharing problem you just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded it makes sense to     prevent from saving but not opening  eh i dont follow    its by no means easy to satisfy everybody but if microsoft want to keep their reputations they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute  why is it that i find the mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever i use it     no flame please  yeah right you post flame bait yet ask for no flames             iskandar taib                           the only thing worse than peach ala internet ntaibsilverucsindianaedu     frog is frog ala peach bitnet   ntaibiubacs                   
   unless i am completely misunderstanding you try using either notepad or syseditexe found in your system subdirectory to edit you ini files you can add sysedit  regedit to a program group they are windows programs  the syseditexe program is cool because it automatically opens you winini systemini autoexecbat and configsys files to be edited  is it possible to get it to load other ini files   drewster am00kimbarkuchicagoedu      email   unx oddjobozplymouthedu vms andyspscplymouthedu  disclaimer  any enduser software that provides no avenue for user  of the week modification or programmability is not user friendly      
   i have heard many things about the ati ultra pro card some have  been positive but most are negative could people please confirm  these  i am interested in the eisa version in particular    0 the card does not work in a system with 00m ram  the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only as far as i know  the vlb and eisa version should have no problems    0 the card works in a 00m system with some switches     set but it is much slower  again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 000m ram eisa and vlb or 00 m isa  00m should not be a problem for you     0 the card is interlaced in its 00bit truecolour modes  nope  i can use 000x000 at 00hz 00bit and 000x000 at 00hz 00bit all noninterlaced    0 the latest build 00 drivers still do not work in many     cases  they arent perfect but are much improved  i dont recall the last time which i had to leave mach 00 mode ati gup mode and switch to 0000 or vga mode due to software incompatibility    0 this card is the fastest full colour card for the money  its quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate    0 this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread   i like it    daniel matthew coleman      internet dcolemanutxvmsccutexasedu   dcolemanccwfccutexasedu the university of texas at austin   decnet utxvmsdcoleman electricalcomputer engineering    bitnet dcolemanutxvms bitnet

   we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using w0wg for a while now  we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway  you also need a tcpip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but thats what they require to get the smtp gateway to work  you need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff  we do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do    there is a glitch somewhere in the system though  i dont know if it is ms mail the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent  the scenario is this  the outgoing mail goes to a unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go  if that mail is routed to the vax the vax has problems some times receiving the mail most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the vax forwarded to some other location  that is the main gotcha where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying boudary error garbage code stuff  if you can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok  the system people of course say that the vax is not the problem the gateway is probably the problem  if anyone wants to get help it is only 00000 for one support call until problem is worked out  phooey to that i say  i am looking vigorously for a better idea    if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew  please drop me a note  anyone  the next itteration is supposed to have tcpip built in they say  the netxt itteration of w0wg  good luck     wes james                   email  wesjextsparcagsciusuedu   utah state university   cooperative extension   systems specialist   umc 0000                    voice  0000000000   logan ut 000000000          fax  0000000000

   ive been reading with much confusion about whether or not to use atmanager lately all the packages ive been buying have all included atmanager as a bonus i do some desktop publishing using pagemaker and coreldraw coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over 000 diff types add that to the ttfonts that come with win00 and you have a decent amount of fonts i print my creations out on an hp0 postcript at 000 dpi resolution with the resolution enhancement  technology and   well  i get some darn good copies  so good that there isnt any diff whether or not atmanager is turned on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technologies  and tt    avdean

      dear friend      the risc means reduced instruction set computer the risc usually has     small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase     the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some books about    computer architecture for more information about risc  risc used to mean reduced instruction set computer true  they still use the same acronym but only to be familiar  what risc really means is a recentlydesigned cpu    in general most risc cpus are like this      a large number 00 or more of generalpurpose registers     a fixed instruction size usually 00 bits     an instruction may make only one memory reference     memory references must be aligned     there are delayed branches branch after the next instruction or a target prediction bit probably willwont branch     instructions may complete out of order relative to the instruction stream   richard krehbiel                                 richkgrebyncom os0 00 will do for me until amigados for the 000 comes along

  i just purchased the norton desktop for windows and i also have norton utilities  when i installed ndw it wanted to rem out the line that installed ep ep on and the command to invoke the image utility it replaced the image command with a new image command that invokes the version of image that came with ndw  this makes sense as presumably the image version with ndw is newer than the one with nu  it did not however install smartcan in the autoexec  now two questions    0  will nu use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked        ie are the two version of image compatable    0  will erase protect use the info from smartcan and vice versa        i use both dos and windows and i want to make sure that when i        erase files in either environment they are going to be protected  from the experiments i have run the two programs erase protect and smart erase dont use each others info i currently have both ep and smartcan loading within my autoexec and i dont see any conflicts  fyi   norton desktop for windows version 00        norton utils version 0  thanks for any help  
  word 00c doesnt show the periodcentred character to indicate spaces if i use the ttfonts from coreldraw  our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box  they overlap each other and characters on each side which is useless  i believe the character used by w0w is the periodcentred 0000 this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this  i have edited the corel font with fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0000 character makes no difference to the font output in charmap or w0w altering the paragraph 0000 or cedilla 0000 does alter their font graphics displayed however  is the w0w character used to indicate spaces the periodcentred character  has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a coreldraw ttf                                                                              russ sharp    russdeakineduau    ph 00000 0000    fax 00000 0000     deakin university school of engineering  technology geelong australia

     here is an annoying problem whenever i save an icon which contains dark colors like dark red or dark purple these colors are converted to the bright colors this happens with every icon editor including the image editor that came with sdk i dont have this problem with bmp files either only with ico files or icon libraries the problem is with the icon colormap field in the icon file header checking the file with a binary editor i can see that the masks are ok by editing the colormap manually copying from another icon that i didnt edit i can fix the colors does anybody know what may be causing this problem   thanks     sadun anik u of illinois at urbanachampaign center for reliable and highperformance computing email anikcrhcuiucedu

  hi there  we are running a 000 node token ring with windows 00 and novell 000  every once in a while we run into the black screen of death a phrase coined by robert x cringely in a recent infoworld column    basically sometimes when you quit windows the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen  also sometimes when you exit to dos the same effect occurs cringely hints that microsoft andor novell has a patch for windows virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this  neither company seems to know what i am talking about when i call them  has anyone else noticed this phenomenon    is there a fix for it  any response is welcome  peter sweeney psweeneymiavx0acsmuohioedu

  reposting and summarizing for your information or additional comment   this is long   i have 00mb of memory on my 000sx 00 mhz an intel math coprocessor and a 000mb hard drive with 00mb free no compression  i have been running mathcad 00 under windows 00 in enhanced mode with a 0mb ram drive 0mb0mb smart drive and no swap file permanent or temporary for several months  i am interested in the faster mathcad 00 but i am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of mathsofts claim about increased speed  to 000sx users    will mathcad 00 run without a swap file or insist that i use a swap file  so far in response to a less detailed description of my setup or in unrelated postings the more informed answers on the net or by email appear to be    0 by fuessllnlgov david a fuess       according to mathsoft no mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as     not to overburden the physical resources they say this is actually a     win00s feature a figure of 00mb was indicated to me as a minimum but     you might try anyway    0 by berttylersatalinkcom bert tyler       im not all that certain that mathcad is the culprit here         i have a 00000dx0 with 00mb of main memory less 0mb for a ramdisk and     a bit for a dos session that is opened as part of the startup process     which i have been running without any swapfile  when i installed the     win00s subsystem from the march beta of the nt sdk the win00s subsystem     itself demanded the presence of a swapfile  the only win00s program     ive run to date is the 00bit version of freecell that came with that     subsystem         i gave windows a small temporary swapfile im leery of files that must     remain in fixed locations on my hard disk and all seems well    0 by bcaececmuedu brian c anderson       what is win00  i upgraded to mathcad 00 and it installed a directory for     win00 under windowssystem   during the upgrade it told me that win00     was required    0 by case0000studenttcumnedu steven v case0      mathcad 00 makes use of the win00s libraries  youve probably    heard about win00s it is a 00bit windows library that provides    much of the windows nt functionality no support for threads and    multitasking and such but can be run under windows 00    0 by rhynetczardozchemappstateedu thomas c rhyne       i also have 00 mb of ram and indeed mathcad 00 insisted on a permanent     swapfile it would not run otherwise    0 by bishopbaeyerchemfsuedu greg bishop       0 mathcad absolutely requires 0mb ram with 00mb swap file or 0mb ram     with 0mb swap file  it will give you a not enough memory error if the     swap file is less than 0mb  it is a major resource hog  if you do not     load the symbolic processor or the smart math it takes about 0mb of ram     real or virtual just to load again due to the win00s libraries                                                                                   so it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on mathsofts    advertisement for 00 that you need a swap file possibly as big as 00mb     looks like i would just need an 0mb swap file and would need to choose or    can i between a faster permanent swap file or a slower temporary swap file                                                                                 apparently a win00 subsystem ships with mathcad 00  how much disk space      does this require                                                                                                                                             i also received

  can anyone tell me how chicagowindows 0 would differ from os0 0x  believe it or not im not trying to start a flame war here   im simply curious  if there is going to be any feature advantage in either of these products i do not consider the fact that it has uncle bills seal of approval much of a feature  one difference will probably be the same difference as between os0 and windows 0x nowone will likely have a lot of software available for it and one wont emulation with the inevitable incompatibilities that crop up in spite of all the contrary claims just doesnt count when you have to use a certain software package that doesnt quite run properly under the emulation developers want to channel their resources toward a platform that has a large installed base and in a case like that the platform that is most successfully marketed regardless of its relative sophistication will win  lamont downs downsnevadaedu  
  so good that there isnt any diff whether or not atmanager is turned on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technologies  and tt  there are some fonts that are only available as ps fonts  if you have a ps font that you want to use use atm  otherwise it is a waste of system resources  or if you need to use a service bureau and theyre only set up to use type 0 fonts from what ive heard pure hearsay the results of outputting tt fonts as type 0 is not as good as using highquality type 0 fonts in the first place  lamont downs downsnevadaedu

     brad banko writes while running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows 00  this evening i got a program has violated system integrity close all  applications exit windows and restart your computer error  gawd i love windows   0  is there an easy way to restore everything to working order what might be some better approaches  youll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh  data files should be examined and repaired  0  what might have caused this  does the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable  im suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing  youre not stupid  smartdrive caches things and windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also  all of this is pretty risky stuff in a pc environment  the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to  fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things  a reasonably accurate prediction   heres a brief description of how dos stores files  there are three pieces to a file  the directory entry the fat chain and the data area  you can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of 0x0 cards  the directory entry notebook paper holds the file name actual size and first cluster number  it also holds some other information thats not important right now  the file allocation table fat chain graph paper tells where to find the actual data  each square of graph paper holds a number  if the number is zero the cluster associated with this box is available  if it holds a magic number it is either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk  any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file  the data area 0x0 cards is where the actual information is stored the data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size storage is doled out in chunks of one cluster each  in your case one cluster is 0000 bytes  as a cluster is filled another is allocated  to read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number  now you read the data from that cluster next look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read  this will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file naturally these numbers are usually sequential but they can jump around and even go backwards  continue reading one cluster at a time as you walk this chain through the fat until you hit the marker which says its the last cluster in the file  chkdsk is the dos utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the fat and can bludgeon most flaws into submission  it doesnt have any intelligence so you have to doublecheck anything it fixes  now lets do a bit of a postmortem  cgfxvpic00cvpicexe cgfxvpic00vpictxt cgfxvpic00video0cfg cgfxvpic00orcpro0cfg cgfxvpic00vgacfg cgamegoosebird0x cwinmiscadv00winadvexe    allocation error size adjusted  all of these files have sizes according to the fat which dont match the size reported in their directory entries  chkdsk f will alter the directory entries to match the fat size  in other words   the directory entry for cvpicexe may say the file is 00000 bytes long but chkdsk found a fat chain of 00 clusters attached to it  my numbers obviously are made up     000 lost allocation units found in 000 chains     000000 bytes disk space would be freed  disk space was found which is allocated in the fat but is not attached to any directory entry  chkdsk f gives you the option of converting these lost chains to files  you can then examine the files file0000chk through file0000chk and rename or discard them  or if you tell chkdsk not to convert them to files then those clusters will simply be marked available in the fat   cgfxvpic00cvpicexe    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000    c000spartpar    is cross linked on allocation unit 00000  these files are both referencing the same data cluster  obviously one of them at least must be wrong  its interesting to note that c000spartpar is your windows swap file  to fix this you should copy each crosslinked file to a new name this will fix the crosslink by giving the files unique data spaces now delete the crosslinked files  examine the copies and try to assemble them properly  good luck  hint  missing pieces are likely to be found in those lost chains at the top    00000000 bytes total disk space    0000000 bytes in 0 hidden files     000000 bytes in 00 directories   00000000 bytes in 0000 user files    0000000 bytes available on disk  your disk is pretty close to full  this may be the actual cause of the problem perhaps windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space  in any case the short summary is that something trashed your fat there are utilities that can mirror your fat and help repair damage after something like this but you have to run them before the problem occurs  sorry

  i just installed a new truetype font under mswindows 00 but though all the applications display the font correctly on the screen quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly on a laserjet 0  nonpostscript printer  when i use the font in coreldraw the document prints correctly so i assume coreldraw knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer  but when i use the windows accessory write the printer prints square boxes in place of the characters of the new font yet write does display the font correctly on the screen  i looked through all the windows and laserjet manuals but got nowhere all of them just make the statement that truetype fonts will print exactly as you see them on the screenso i assume windows knows that a font has to be downloaded automaticallybut how to make it do that  appreciate any help  i assume youre using the driver available from cica hp0v000zip bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel click on the options button brings up another screen of choices change the graphics mode from hpgl0 to raster and check the box print truetype as graphics this is only available when you choose raster now you should be able to print all your truetype fonts correctly good luck   lei shao ls000cunixacccolumbiaedu   
   to those interested in the new ati ultra cards  i had posted some questions regarding the new ati ultra pro cards and had asked confirmation of some opinions  this message is a summary of the responses thanks to all of you that replied    0 the card does not work in a system with 00m ram  a the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only as far as i know  the vlb    and eisa version should have no problems   b im pretty sure from my experience that the isa version doesnt    work in systems with over 00m ram  there is supposed to be way    of switching the memory aperture feature off to prevent this    but apparently it doesnt work  i posted some help me messages    on the net and people indicated that the eisa card didnt have this    problem  c false  d the vlb card which i have allows you to set memory aperture over 00m    by using their configuration software  no messing with jumpers necessary     the 00m problem is probably valid only for isa cards    0 the card works in a 00m system with some switches     set but it is much slower  a again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 000m ram    eisa and vlb or 00 m isa  00m should not be a problem for you    b dunno  c depends on the bus yes if isa no if eisa or localbus    0 the card is interlaced in its 00bit truecolour modes  a nope  i can use 000x000 at 00hz 00bit and 000x000 at 00hz 00bit all    noninterlaced  b yes  according to pc magazine theyve tested a local bus version    that does 0000x000 in 00bit which may or may not be interlaced  c not for the pro sometimes for the plus     some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors this has nothing to     do with 00 bits  only with screen size note that for 00 bit color    and windows you must have 0 megs memory size calculations notwithstanding    0 the latest build 00 drivers still do not work in many     cases  a they arent perfect but are much improved  i dont recall the last time which    i had to leave mach 00 mode ati gup mode and switch to 0000 or vga mode due    to software incompatibility  b true  many people recommended going back to build 00 or 00  c they appear to be excellent but have a few bugs for example certain    graphs with dashed lines in mathcad 00 do not print correctly though they    do display ok on the screen they are about par for fancy cards     other accelerated cards also have bugs  d overall i like the card even if driver performance is somewhat less than    satisfactory  i am running the 0000000 00 color mode as that is all my    nt driver for october nt version seems to allow     i will say this that color performance is not quite as nice as a diamond    stealth vram but i have not been able to try out a lot of the options on    the old driver    0 this card is the fastest full colour card for the money  a its quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate   b yes  ill admit it was very very fast in 00bit mode which is what    i wanted to use it for  too bad it crashed in many different ways    every 00 minutes or so  c depends on many many things    0 this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread   a i like it  b well  pc magazine seems to think it is  c yes this appears to be true   d as to greatest thing since sliced bread i doubt it  better cards are    coming out  who knows maybe ati will come out with something faster yet    several reviews i read rated one pycon winjet card as a superior performer     at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers which pycon was     developing at that time  pc magazine about two months or so back     overall the card has a lot of potential but you have to be able to use it     that is the end of the questions these were the most discussed items in this group so i thought they needed confirmation for those of you not familiar with the card i have included a summary here from an ati ad since i dont have an graphics ultra yet  ati graphics ultra plus  accelerated 0000x000 at 00k colours  true colour000m at 000x000  multimedia video acceleration for indeo videorle and video 0 compressed   stretch full motion video windows to full size  fast vga  includes 0 button mouse isa versions only  antialiased fonts ed avail in 00 colour mode onlyi think  realtime pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop  around a 00 length card size  priced from 000 us  ati graphics ultra pro  everything in graphics ultra plus  faster performance with vrams  accelerated 0000x0000 at 000 colours 00hz noninterlaced  available in isa eisa and microchannel  priced from 000 us  ati technologies 000 0000000  i hope this summary can be of use to you  al  ps  i am not associated with ati technologies in any way other       than having used their previous ati ultra card for a few       years which i generally liked     alan walford     eos systems inc vancouverbc canada  tel 0000000000 aeweosvcrwimseybcca           or        uunetwimseybccaeosvcraew

  hi  my last question for the year  i have a mailorder noname notebook with 0 meg ram  i never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview but win00 and w0w00 constantly crash on me most commonly citing a memory parity error  the only thing i can do is turn off and reboot  my cmos ticks off  counts all the memory every startup and there is never a problem with this either  could it be a bug in my windows copy instead of the hardware  i remember having some disk error problems when installing it   is there any change i could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of this happening i think win vs win s produce different crashes but both crash frequently nonetheless  i know this is a pain but please answer by email because my home account doesnt have rn  and i will stop asking questions now  thank you chet pager  chetteructhpxuctacza

  i would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few  questions about windows for workgroups  i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver 00 i am considering moving all our machines to w0wg  q0  how much conventional ram does w0wg use over and above the      driver for the network card  about 00kbyte without novell 000 support  q0  if i have a novell ne0000 card are the lsl and ipx drivers      still needed  no  q0  does w0wg do a license check over the network to ensure each      machine is running its own licenced copy of w0wg note i do      not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy      of w0wg for each of our machines it is just that i would like      to try it out first to see if it meets our needs returning one      opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies  no q0  if you buy the upgrade to windows 00 for w0wg does it replace      all of win 00 as you install it or does it depend on current      win 00 files  nearly all  q0  if i install windows nt on my server when it comes out will i have      any troubles with the w0wg machines  we run mixed wnt beta and w0wg no problem apart from printer sharing beta problem  when i started this message i was going to ask only 0 questions but i got carried away ill stop now   we had problems with mouse drivers using w0wg where windows 00 didnt seems to be  more critical about it it was actualy a port problem with the network card running on 0x0e0 we changed it to 0x000 now everything is allright i think it has to do with the ami bios as well  i look forward to your replies  al    alan walford     eos systems inc vancouverbc canada  tel 0000000000 aeweosvcrwimseybcca           or        uunetwimseybccaeosvcraew       ralf rutherford telecom aust    mhsnet rruthercsscmelbtansucomau network services                snail  000 blackburn rd clayton vic 0000  customised software solutions    australia    center melbourne             phone  00 0 000 0000 fax 00 0 000 0000

  ive pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because i have the same requirements you doand the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers dont accept mice at any but com0 and com0 using irq0 or irq0 unless you buy special drivers from someone who has themive talked to mouse systems who say their driver doesnt support other than com0 and com0 as above  but who claim to be releasing one that will soon  the other alternative seems to be possible but in one case prohibitively expensive ie 0 port card for 000 and in the other the authors of powerbbs for windows claim to have a 0 port serial card with buffered 00000 uarts and drivers for windows to match ie com0 irq0 for 000  the second paragraph is hearsay because i havent checked it out yetbut intend to as soon as i can free up 000 g  hope this will save you some steps   
   ive been reading with much confusion about whether or not to use atmanager lately all the packages ive been buying have all included atmanager as a bonus i do some desktop publishing using pagemaker and coreldraw coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over 000 diff types add that to the ttfonts that come with win00 and you have a decent amount of fonts i print my creations out on an hp0 postcript at 000 dpi resolution with the resolution enhancement  technology and   well  i get some darn good copies  so good that there isnt any diff whether or not atmanager is turned on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technologies  and tt  atm will do nothing for your truetype fonts  if your truetype fonts are sufficient for your needs dont run atm  i have a lot of fonts that i can install either as type0 postscript under atm or as truetype  i have noticed that      0truetype font files are at least 00 larger than their type0 equivalents  if you are using a disk compressor though be aware that truetype fonts will compress whereas type0 fonts will not they are encrypted      0with a 000 dpi laser printer the artificial bold version of a truetype font is indistingishable from the original forcing me to install the actual bold and bolditalic etc variants if i want to use them  type0 postscript fonts under atm generate a visually distinct bold variant from the base font  i realize that the artificial bold font that atm generates is aesthetically inferior to the handgenerated bold truetype variant but it is sufficient for my needs and not having to install bold variants saves me 00 on disk space uncompressed   bob nichols att bell laboratories rnicholsihlpmihattcom

  greetings     ive had a bunch of problems with the 00x  opening a dos window on the desktop can occasionally result in the windows blowing up into a set of horizontal lines hashing the entire desktop  nothing can recover this  except to completely exit from windows  the other irritating problem is that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually scrolling as if a cr was printed without an lf  this seems only to happen to communications programs but i cant nail it down any further than that note though that the comms programs dont have to be communicating  even just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in these programs causes the problem        prior to the latest rev of word perfect for windows wpwin would sometimes blow up and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of the problem  ive still seen this but only once or twice with wpwin 00        dave zimmerman    my opinions are my own

    hello fellow netters  i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj000 bubblejet vs the hp deskjet 000  i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential  and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson  now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 000 dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlettpackard deskjet 000 000 dpi which is faster  is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics  which will handle large documents better 00 pages or more  any personal experience on either will be appreciated here  which works better under windows 00 any driver problems etc cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc  basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and bad  advance kudos and thanks for all your input  email or news posting is readily acceptable but email is encouraged limits bandwidth   sincerely  robert kaymankaymancsstanfordedu  or  cpacsstanfordedu  in theory theory and practice are the same  in practice they are not you mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision  revised   sorry for the followup but i couldny get email through on your addresses i too am trying to decide between these two printers and i would like to hear what users of these printers have to say about the questions above  thank you  randyrandymsccornelledu

       so good that there isnt any diff whether or not atmanager is turned    on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these    better printer technologies  and tt        there are some fonts that are only available as ps fonts  if you    have a ps font that you want to use use atm  otherwise it is    a waste of system resources         or if you need to use a service bureau and theyre only set up to use    type 0 fonts from what ive heard pure hearsay the results of outputting    tt fonts as type 0 is not as good as using highquality type 0 fonts in    the first place  unless you print to file with the correct resolution set for the final output device image setter  a problem with tt fonts in windows is that they do get converted to t0 format ok and the hinting is even used while this is done but the resulting t0 fonts are not hinted  the result is that they will work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the ps file is generated but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution    so when you print to an attached ps printer with the ps driver set up for this printer results may be quite good  but if you take a ps file made for that printer and run it on a device of different resolution such as an image setter then the results may not be so good

  the deskjet is slow  this is in comparison to the other printers i mentioned  i have no idea how the bubblejet compares  the interface between win00 and the printer is just dandy ive not had any problems with it  i just bought a bj000 printer a couple of days ago  i compared it to the  sample print of an hp deskjet 000 and knew that the hp wasnt for me  the  bj000 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality  i can compare it  with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical  depending on the kind of paper  i dont have problems with the ink not  being dry it seems to dry very fast  probably within a second  since  canon is giving a 00 rebate until the end of may it is really a good buy    sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications  d000 hfac brigham young university provo ut  00000 0000000000  hfaccsrbyuedu ecktonsucsbyuedu

  i am using dos quick c 00 in a dos window under windows 00 and the other day while i was running the compiler i got a general protection fault immediately followed by a serious disk error  when i rebooted i found that about 00 files had gotten crosslinked which is a pretty serious corruption of the hard drive file system  i am concerned that quick c in a dos window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrvexe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem  i thought that dos programs run in dos windows were pretty wellcontained  by windows  if that is true then maybe the quick c compiler has nothing  to do with it  has anybody else had this type of problem  i only recently upgraded from quick c 00 to 00  brad banko     brad banko  dept of physics  u of illinois  bbankouiucedu  see one  do one  teach one00 de kb0cne  n0lnqil  
   btw how would you rate the new borland turbo c visual edition for windows anyone  time for a new discussion maybe  i asked in these groups some time ago what about the tcve and got no answers so i decided to try my brother who lives in the us bought and sent it to me and im still trying to get used to it  before i put my goodbad points list consider i am a turbo pascaldos programmer and sometimes try to make something in unix with c just some exercises from university i used to make some programs in microsoft c version 0  because we used some thirdparty libraries that required that   i like borland it seems to me much more easier to use than microsoft   specially the debugger i tried to learn codeview sometimes but never   felt confortable with it  tc ve seems very nice to create simple apps like the examples on the   objectwindows book so far no problems lets see next week or so when i   will try something more complex  it works nice even in my weak machine 00000mhz 0 mb ram   but   the manual for the resource workshop seems to be from a different version    from the workshop itself some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual  i think i will run into trouble since i got this tcve from my brother   as a present i didnt wanted to buy the japanese version because 0 i    suspect that the manuals will be in japanese  and 0 i believe it   will be far more expensive here so he bought it as a present and sent to   me i send the registration card to the japanese branch of borland but   who knows  so id like to ask some questions for you all   i know that there are some microsoft guys around here in this group is   there anybody from borland  is there any email address that we can    contact the technical support  not for stupid questions but to ask   for example why the rw manual seems to be different from the rw itself   is there anybody else using it around here   will the book of petzold be useful for me  i intend to use rw and protogen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself   answers to my email or composmswindowsprogrammertools please  thanks in advance  rafael

  thanks to all those people who recommended workspace managers for windows 00  i found 0 shareware workspace managers from australias mswindows archive monu0ccmonasheduau which mirrors some sites in the us  the three i found were  0 workspaces 000 wspacezip                                 this was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that i found  it is very easy to use    it displays a small window containing 0 buttons plus an extra    button for configuration purposes  one annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run  you must press    a key not a mouse button for the thing to go away  also it would    have been nice if there was an always on top setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons  maybe some userspecified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature  the simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package  0 workshift 00 wrksft00zip                                while this workspace manager offered a    few features that workspaces 000 lacked it was quite time consuming    to set things up  with workspaces 000 all but the first workspace    is initially empty  with workshift 00 you need to take snapshots    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like  ie what     applications they contain  also the main window is quite large    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace    with workspaces 000 there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it  workshift 00 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful  0 bigdesk 000 and backmenu backdeskzip                             this is an interesting package which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager  other goodies    include backmenu which provides a popup root menu when you    press a certain mouse button  just like in xwindows  the menu    is totally configurable offering unlimited depth of cascading menus    which is provides quite handy access to applications  you could    say it is a menubased alternative to the program manager  also    bundled in backdeskzip is a program called wrun which allows    you to run windows applications from a dos shell under windows    instead of using the file manager to run applications      the actual workspace manager is called bigdesk 000  bigdesk works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesnt provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces    in fact it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on  this means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one  the bigdesk control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop  basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blowup    of a particular section  try each of them out for yourself  i was impressed with all of them so find out which one suits your needs the best  
  in article 0qu0ud0hdsunbocsmqeduau eugenempcemqeduau writes in article c0o0yqm00csienctuedutw ghhwangcsienctuedutw ghhwang writes  dear friend   the risc means reduced instruction set computer the risc usually has  small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase  the clock rate to have a high performance you can read some books about computer architecture for more information about risc  hmm not that i am an authority on risc  but i clearly remember reading that the instruction set on risc cpus is rather large the difference is in addressing modes  risc instruction sets are not as orthogonal is cisc     theoretically supposed to be reduced not any longer  thats why everyone is arguing about risc vs cisc  personally i think cisc will win out just take a look at the pentium  not that i like intel architectures either but thats another story  bye   do you mean that the pentium is better than a risc  or that it will outsell them all  if the first you have to remember that intel cisc like the pentium are a always a generation away from the best riscs also riscs cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities not even on the same order  but i remember reading about 0 years maybe 0 about a t000 from hypercube that did a 000 mips was superscallar and reordered its instruction itself so  
  note the followups are set to composos0misc  dmqs files describe monitors and valid modes to be used by the xga0 under both windows and os0  these files are unsupported  ibm has nothing to do with these files or this post  its personal this time and every time i post  see the signature  due to demand and requests here are some additional dmqs files ive collected for the xga0  these files function with the latest revision of the drivers for the xga0  not all these files will work under windows with the drivers available to the general public at this time  all files will function under the most recent os0 00 beta and those ive tried have worked under os0 00sp  not all files have been fully tested  these files are unsupported  they represent a personal collection not anything resembling an officially supported set  as a standard disclaimer i would like to point out the following facts 0 some of these files may run your adapter out of spec  doing so can    stress the ics on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in    shorter life how short depends on how much out of spec boom  0 some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of    spec for your monitor resulting in damage to your monitor 0 you should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapters ability    to use the mode you select  using these files represents hacking    in a very true sense so practice safe computing and dont play    around too much if you dont like the risks and arent knowledgable    about what youre doing 0 if you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings use the dmqs files    you have or wait until ibm releases official tested dmqs files    although you should be aware of warning 0 even with the ibm files  these files are unsupported  by using them you may invalidate your warrenty  not all have been fully tested  i dont have that many monitors  installation unpack in your dmqspath environment variable usually cxgadmqs  then use the methods described in your xga0 installation diskette to change your adapter or settings  packing these files have been packed with the latest infozip utility   you will need pkzip 0x if you dont have the infozip utilities  submitting  feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite dmqs files for your favorite monitors  im always interested in collecting more  archive  these files have been uploaded

   hi i have a trident tvga0000 video card and need the updated drivers for win00 where can i get them from an ftp site   thanks  bj  
  has anyone experienced a faint shadow at all resolutions using this card is only in windows i have replaced card and am waiting on  latest drivers also have experienced general protection fault errors in wspdpsfdrv on winword tools option menu and in winfax setup  i had the exact same failure with the 00x and word for windows a quick call to microsoft indicated it was problem with the 00x drivers you need to call diamond and get the new drivers i think version 000 fixes the above problem there may be later versions that im unaware of      dale r pischke           daleodeticscom  or  uunetodeticsdale senior software engineer odetics gyyr division  
  a while ago i installed spss for windows as part of an evaluation once the evaluation was complete i duly deleted the software from my pc  unfortunately there is still a ghost of spss left when i run something like write and go to embed an object then spss chart appears on the list of objects im offered i looked around all the obvious ini files without success the next thing i tried was looking for the string spss chart in every file in the  windows directory it turned up in a file called reqdat or regdat unfortunately the file was binary and so i didnt feel inclined to edit it  id welcome a solution for removing spss from the list of ole servers  chris wooff cwooffliverpoolacuk

  program manager but it seems that everytime i install something new that makes a new group it promptly disappears after i turn of windows  0 did you check that a new grp file was actually created in your windows     directory 0 are you turning off your computer when windows is running rather than     closing program manager     ekkehard

   i have a bat file that i run under a windows icon  i have set up a pif file to run the bat file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen the first line of the bat file sets an environment variable  my problem is that on some of our machines running msdos 00 and windows 00 in enhanced mode the set command in the bat file fails with the out of environment space error  i have raised the amount of environment space to 0000 bytes using the shell command in configsys so i know that i am nowhere near to running out   from the windows resource toolkit for win0workgroups add an entry to your systemini file under the nonwindowsapp section      commandenvsizennnn  this sets the commandcom env size where nnnn must either be 0 or between 000 and 00000  a value of 0 disables the setting  if this value is too small or too big it is rounded up to 000 or down to 00000 if the value is less than the current size of the actual environment this setting is disabled as if it were 0  if you specify the environment size in a pif file for commandcom the pif setting overrides this setting  the default is 0 with msdos versions earlier than 00  otherwise the default value is the e option in the shell command in configsys  to set this value you must edit your systemini and reboot   i have used this entry as well as relied on the default e from the configsys shell line and both give larger environments  if you dont use one of these then the environment passed by windows to each new dos box is just a little bit bigger than the environment variables present when windows was started  no matter how big the dos env was when windows starts it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes  this should allow your batch file to run but your mileage may vary   jerome jerry schneider             domain jlsatgcom  aspen technology group               uucp   uunetcsnatglabjls po box 000 ft collins co 00000    voice  000 0000000

  from kaymancsdd0stanfordedu robert kayman subject canon bj000 bubblejet and hp deskjet 000 keywords printer date 00 apr 00 000000 gmt   hello fellow netters  i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj000 bubblejet vs the hp deskjet 000  i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential  and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson  now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 000 dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlettpackard deskjet 000 000 dpi which is faster  is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics  which will handle large documents better 00 pages or more  any personal experience on either will be appreciated here  which works better under windows 00 any driver problems etc cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc  basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and bad  advance kudos and thanks for all your input  email or news posting is readily acceptable but email is encouraged limits bandwidth   sincerely  robert kayman       kaymancsstanfordedu  or  cpacsstanfordedu  in theory theory and practice are the same  in practice they are not you mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision  revised   all right  not saying i know any more than the average salesguy ill give  your question a shot   the key issue that i bought my bj000 on was ink drying speed  you really  have to try awful hard to get the bj000 ink to smear  the hp deskjets need  0000 seconds to completely dry  in both cases however do not get your  pages wet  unlike laser printers the material on your pages is ink not  toner  but that should go without saying  my pc has very little memory only 0meg ram so the bj000 takes a little  while to print  but every application i use takes a while to run  once  the computer is solely printing it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 0000 seconds depending on how detailed your graphics are    the bj000 can do windows soft fonts  im assuming that the deskjet can or  hp wouldnt sell many  size is another factor  the bj000 is much smaller but the hp is built  like a tank  i bet the bj000 would get damaged first  finally the print quality  i love the bj000s resolution  it looks like  a good laser quality print  the hps ive usedthey look like ink  not  as impressive    so i chose the canon  any other opinions

  thomasdfellrath0ndedundedu wrote   the key issue that i bought my bj000 on was ink drying speed  you really   have to try awful hard to get the bj000 ink to smear  the hp deskjets need   0000 seconds to completely dry  in both cases however do not get your   pages wet  unlike laser printers the material on your pages is ink not   toner  but that should go without saying  i think the ink now used in the deskjet family is waterfast

  a while ago i installed spss for windows as part of an evaluation once the evaluation was complete i duly deleted the software from my pc  unfortunately there is still a ghost of spss left when i run something like write and go to embed an object then spss chart appears on the list of objects im offered i looked around all the obvious ini files without success the next thing i tried was looking for the string spss chart in every file in the  windows directory it turned up in a file called reqdat or regdat unfortunately the file was binary and so i didnt feel inclined to edit it  id welcome a solution for removing spss from the list of ole servers  i think you can do this with regedit which can make changes to the ole registration database  from program manager or  file manager choose run and type regedit  you do have it its included with windows but not well documented  tom paladinworldstdcom

   article crossposted from composmswindowsapps   author was dr richard timmer   posted on 00 apr 00 000000 gmt    hello winnetters  i have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of  ms access and borland paradoxwin  however are there any users out there  with experience with the database package called approach  it has gotten a number of very good reviews from the various mags and it seems like it would require less hardware overhead than paradox  i have ruled out access because some aspects of it are extremely nonintuitive eg requiring a field to always have a value  i like what ive seen of paradox but it seems like the resource requirements are greater than what i have 00000 mhz 0 mb ram  so please provide me with your thoughts are approach good and bad  thanks   richard timmer    
   in a previous article jpaparelcsulowelledu joseph paparella says  ive pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because i have the same requirements you doand the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers dont accept mice at any but com0 and com0 using irq0 or irq0 unless you buy special drivers from someone who has themive talked to mouse systems who say their driver doesnt support other than com0 and com0 as above  but who claim to be releasing one that will soon  the other alternative seems to be possible but in one case prohibitively expensive ie 0 port card for 000 and in the other the authors of powerbbs for windows claim to have a 0 port serial card with buffered 00000 uarts and drivers for windows to match ie com0 irq0 for 000  the second paragraph is hearsay because i havent checked it out yetbut intend to as soon as i can free up 000 g  hope this will save you some steps    i had this problem when i first loaded windows  my io card is for 0 hds 0 fds 0 parrelel 0 serial 0 for mouse and 0 for my external modem and a game port  problem enters  the darn serial ports have no selection for  com settings they are stuck on 0 and 0   good card for hds and fds but lousy for serial   i called microsoft and other places  the long and short of it is windows wants com0 and 0 only for mouse selection i went out and bought a small io card just for parrelel and serial now i have all 0 active com ports and lpt0 and lpt0 this half card was less than 00  mouse on com 0  external modem on com 0  i disabled the lpt0 so i could use the interupt for my scanner card irq cya artin       this communication is sent by    artin   university of arizona tucson      ak000clevelandfreenetedu   mlinsenbccitarizonaedu  mlinsenbarizvms   death has been dead for about 0000 years  follow the king of kings

  a couple of weeks ago i posted a question concerning communicating between vb and msaccess using dde the answers i received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working however during this process i have come up with new problems  0 there seems to be a limit of 000 characters for a dde topic string is this inherent in all dde systems or just peculiar to msaccess or vb  0 it is easy to query an access database from vb using the dde sql command provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names but how is one meant to update a database    a a dde sql update command does not seem to work    b initiating an access macro using a dde execute command from vb cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from vb using a       second dde channel the programs dead lock until time outs occur       the vb to access channel has to close before the access to vb channel       is initiated i guess    c access does not allow vb to dde poke the information      the way i eventually managed to update a database was by sending key    strokes from vb to access using the sendkeys command this technique has    the problem that access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of keystrokes vb sends  are all the above statements correct or have i made incorrect assumptions are there any better work arounds to the above are there any signs of an odbc driver for access  bob randocicacuk

   ok i have a 000dx00isa w diamond stealth vram 0mb  i was really satisfied w its performance in windows  but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in dos vga  especially this new strike commander   this stealth vram can only give me 000 fps  i use 0dbench  my winmark was 000 million i think    so right now im considering to replace it w a new card which hopefully  can perform approx same w my current vram in windows and also  can perform dos vga preferably 00fps    i am ordering the actix graphicsengine ultra plus it is the same price as the stealth card plus it is also based on s0 000 chip the newest and fastest chip from s0  everyone if you are looking for a card see the april issue of pc magazine for their review   they noted this persons problem with dos the stealth card is not a very good dos performer the actix card is rated the best in this chip class non local bus it got glowing reports from the magazine was a best buy and i called them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week they have a bulletin board to get the latest drivers  though somone posted that this bbs was at 0000   at any rate the actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards in the 000 class based on the winmark results  if you are looking for the all around best doswindows performance  check out the actix card their 0000 number is 0000000  ps the article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user ie games then you should also check out the 000 chip from s0 it apparently scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 000 chip ie stealth and actix cards they have comparable windows performance and are cheaper to buy  eric

   to clarify    vc is considered an upgrade for c0  there will be no product called c 00 although the commandline compiler of vc lists its version as 000  c0 is not a dosonly product  it is a cc compiler capable of producing executables for dos or windows as is vc pro ed  the significant difference is that vc comes with many windowshosted tools ide etc which assist developers in creating windows executables much more quickly basically by automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code  initial impressions have been very favorable  everyone who is a registered user of c0 should have received a considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of c0 if you havent call microsoft and im sure theyd be happy to send you some  jefrem iwaniw pelican software corporation

  well im amazed at how successful this exercise was i received 00 responses and 0 requests for summary thanks to everyone who made it possible  on my own i was able to find out about codebase accsys and qe codebase and accsys are c libraries without sql qe is a windows application that can be communicated through windows dde calls where you send a sql string and receive the results  most people wrote to tell me about the paradox engine from borland other  products mentioned were microsofts odbc accsys quadbase codebase rbase and qe only odbc quadbase rbase and qe have sql  for myself i decided on codebase mostly because it has an ansi c portability version that runs under dos unix etc and includes the source code and portability is important in my application it works with dbase foxpro or clipper files  however i feel that microsofts odbc looks very promising its mostly a formalisation of building and submitting sql queries and formatting query results as the responses say its available via ftp except its effectively unusuable without two manuals the odbc programmers reference and the odbc sdk guide moreover odbc doesnt actually interpret sql and liase with databases thats  up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers also its windows only its actually an extension to the windows sdk  nevertheless its a start at a sql interface standard and should make life interesting in the future  heres my original post followed by the responses separated by  a line of asterisks    does anyone know if borland or microsoft have libraries for accessing  their respective databases paradox foxpro from within c programs  id really like to be able to build a sql query string and pass it  to a function which returns the query results in some format failing  that any other access would still be better than nothing    id also like to hear of third party libraries for doing the same thing    if other people are interested ill prepare a summary of what im  told and post it    thanks to all    borland has a product called paradox engine that does just what you want  the current version is 00 which is fully compatible with ack paradox 00  why the versions are different i dont know pd engine 00 was compatible with pdox 00 and 00  it consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both pascal i think turbo pascal 00 and up and c i think either microsoft or borland  now reading the box its borland paradox engine  database frameworks  works with any borland cc mocrosoft c 000 or later turbo c for windows turbo pascal 00 or later tp for windows 00 or later  for framework applications bc 00 or later or ms cc 00 it does have support for object useage  i havent had a real chance to really use it myself but it

paradox calls in it its hardly sql though  you can do searches on key fields and on  indivual fields but no comparison operators like    so its pretty painful in my opinion do do anything besides simple retrieval and insertsupdates  im currently using it i have an eval copy and ive linked it in to some entry screens ive written  the engine library adds about 000k to the size of the program but you can load it as an overlay using borlands vroom manager  now borland claims that later versions of the engine will have sql support but they dont really expect it till late in the year or even next year they are trying to get thrid parties to help out  if you have any other questions  let me know  mike kamlet mikevpnetchiilus     yes borland sells their paradox engine separately  it has c c and pascal interfaces although the underlying interface is in c well at least for version 00 of the engine which i have costed 00 at egghead they now have version 00 of the engine and a separate c class package for it     michael d kersenbrock adc kentrox  portland oregon michaelkkentroxcom uunetkentroxmichaelk     ive used accsys for paradox new version is almost ready for paradox 00 to access paradox files from c  its pretty good  not sql though  have heard of borland paradox engine or some such which is supposed to do likewise but not sure of what it is exactly  hope this helps good luck chris     borland sells their paradox engine 00  its a library of functions for accessing paradox db files  it comes with libraries for ms c 00 bcc 00 turbo pascal v and i believe it comes with turbo pascalwin libraries as well the c libraries come in both dos and windows flavors the win stuff  being dlls    when i got it it also came with crystal reports which is a graphical report generator  it allows you to create a generic form and use it within a compiled program using pdox engine  i dont know if they still offer it or what the current price is i paid  something like 0000 for an upgrade from the earlier version though  hope this helps  david taylor         the commander     it is easier to change the  internet gt0000cprismgatechedu specification to fit the program     also

                             tom delosh      borland has the paradox engine library  it has libraries for both c and pascal to access paradox files under doswindows   but for paradox i believe youd have buy have the sql link  since pdox itself isnt sql compliant  ive used the engine  for over a year now and have been pretty satisfied with it   under dos its a real pig  it tacks on about 000k to the size of  your programs  tim ma associate programmer university of utah email  timsrccppautahedu    i dont know about microsoft but borland sells the paradox engine for cc  pascal in one package

accessed through a common api to talk to most of the major database formats were using it to build an application that queries several databases using sql queries all access using qe is done using sql

an app with borlands paradox engine for c it also comes in pascal which has recently gone to version 00 ie px engine 00 is compatible with paradox 00 and downward compat w00  there are indeed c libs

look for this type of package in general by the way ive been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of px eng over the past year  wouldnt recommend it for a complex multiuser appbut im staying with it for nowits like a bad marriage ive got too much time invested in learning and workarounds  but if your interest is limited to a simple singleuser interface you want to build your own sql engine i take it px engine will do the job easily  it doesnt sound like youll be bumping into any of the gotchas  if you do write me i may be able to point you in the right direction     borland has a

   due to the resolution and size it is in 00 parts  this is a uuencoded bitmap  000x000 000 colors the picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background the size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 0000x000 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture reguarding image quality and resolution  i have not seen much better  for those of you who havent worked with pieced image files here is how to put it back together 0 save the 00 parts to 00 individual files 0 use a text editor to remove the header and footer    in each file 0 concatinate all the parts into a single file 0 uudecode the file there are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert unix and uucoder windows  if neccesary i could post these tools or where to get them by ftp  let me know  part 0 of 00  begin 000 romanbmp m0dts0hp0h0ldx0ge000u00 mhtta00uk000qly0y000rljjunpui0d0e0d0

   a while ago i installed spss for windows as part of an evaluation once  the evaluation was complete i duly deleted the software from my pc    unfortunately there is still a ghost of spss left when i run  something like write and go to embed an object then spss chart  appears on the list of objects im offered i looked around all  the obvious ini files without success the next thing i tried  was looking for the string spss chart in every file in the   windows directory it turned up in a file called reqdat or  regdat unfortunately the file was binary and so i didnt feel  inclined to edit it    id welcome a solution for removing spss from the list of ole servers    chris wooff  cwooffliverpoolacuk   you can edit that file with a utility that comes with windows 00 called regedit registration info editor      bob hodge    im going fishing you got worms yeah but im going anyway

  id appreciate if you can email or post you positive or negative experience with this monitor especially compared to to nanao 000i id summarize if i got multiple responses  i bought a viewsonic 00 for use at home but after a week i took it back  i  felt for the money my nec 0fg that i use at work was a much better monitor the nec is sharper flatter less distorted and more stable  i have heard  complaints from people about the nec fg series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all  there was nothing really broken with the viewsonic but overall it did not  match up  i used my ati graphics ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the nec did not  i personally like the nonetched nec with the ocli filter  and the tube on the 00 was not as nice  the 00 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems  also it would change brightness  when i switched modes and i was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls  and the yoke was crooked and i had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill  on the postive side although not as handsome  as the nec the 00 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy  i have heard that panasonic owns viewsonic and the model 00 is being sold  through oem channels with a panasonic label on it  if its available that  way at a lower cost i could get more serious about it  for now the nec has  my vote but im searching for one of the new cheaper nec 0fges to see if  its just as good as its older brother the 0fg before i decide which one to  buy  i have no experience with the nanao  i can never keep the nanao models  straight and dont have any place i can walk in to get a good comparison of  all models     standard employer disclaimers apply      keith w johnson      tektronix gpind info services wilsonville or usa internet keithwjohnsontekcom   voice 0000000000   fax 0000000000  
  this is the official request for discussion rfd for the creation of two new newsgroups for microsoft windows nt  this is a second rfd replacing the one originally posted in january 00 and never taken to a vote  the proposed groups are described below  name  composmswindowsntsetup status  unmoderated purpose discussions about setting up and installing windows nt and about  system and peripheral compatability issues for windows nt  name composmswindowsntmisc status unmoderated purpose miscellaneous nonprogramming discussions about using windows nt  including issues such as security networking features console  mode and windows 00 win00 compatability  rationale microsoft nt is the newest member of the microsoft windows family of operating systems or operating environments for those who wish to argue about the meaning of an os  the family ranges from modular windows through windows 00 and windows for workgroups to windows nt at the high end  to date microsoft has shipped over 00000 beta copies and prerelease sdks of windows nt  the actual release is slated for mayjune 00  while windows nt has an entirely new design internally it shares an application programming interface with the other members of the windows family its win00 api includes the win00 api used in win dows 00 and the win00s api subset win00 less threads networking and security can be used to create 00bit applications for windows 00  the user interface is also practically identical to that of windows 00 with the addition of logins and a few other features  it uses program manager file manager and other applets and generally pre sents an identical appearance to the user  many of the announced windows nt applications are ports of existing windows 00 apps and nt also runs existing 00 applications  thus it appears logical that windows nt should share the following groups with the other members of the windows family composmswindowsapps composmswindowsprogrammertools composmswindowsprogrammermisc composmswindowsprogrammerwin00  the following groups are also clearly applicable to windows nt as well as windows 00 composmswindowsannounce composmswindowsadvocacy  in conclusion the only clear argument for the separation of the windows 00 and windows nt hierarchies is different internal structures of windows 00 and windows nt  and yet operating systems such as os0 macintosh os xenix and coherent all have undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate newsgroup hierarchies  further windows 00 is due for a major rewrite itself in 0000  when the fully 00bit protectedmode and withdosbuiltin next generation windows chicago debuts next year surely it should remain in the same hierarchy  and what then would be the jus tification for separating windows nt from other windows versions   discussion period the discussion period will run from 00 april 0000 to 00 may 0000    voting the cfv call for votes will be issued around 00 may 0000 based on the feedback received during the discussion period  no votes will be accepted prior to the cfv    tom haapanen  tomhmetricscom  software metrics inc  waterloo ont         stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth  now pull            up  thats how the corrado makes you feel   car january 00
