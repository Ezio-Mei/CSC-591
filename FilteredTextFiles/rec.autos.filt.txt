  in article 0piip0bo0agateberkeleyedu hubertcwhistlecsberkeleyedu hunghsien hubert chang writes  hi being new to a car owner i would pretty much like to know more about  some basics of maintaining the cars  i know the following  0 oil has to be changed every 0000 miles  change the oil filter too  0 check tires before going on the high way and fill up the tank  make that monthly or more often if you know one or more of your tires has a slow leak  if the tire has a leak you should fix it    what others thank you   0 check all fluids regularly every month check the oil every time you    fill up with gas  doesnt work too well if the engine is hot its more accurate to check the oil when the engine is cool ie not when you are at a gas station  craig

  on cochran writes       id like to add the beretta gtz as a car which will kick gsr butt  anyday and its a lot cheaper to boot   i will take this one with a definate grain of salt  performance data shows a   if this poster has some proofother than my friend blew one away last week        want proof  here is some data on acceleration and handling from motor trend apr 00            integra gsr     beretta gtz  000         00             00 00 mile     000000       000000 l acc gs  00             00 slalom       000            000 wrong why dont you look again at motor trends slalom times they are 000 right along with the integra and the car does that with small 00 inch tires that are all weather xgtv0 not to mention that the integra rides alot better than a beretta your acceleartion times also vary magazine to magazine road  track and car driver have the gsr at 00 to 00 for road and track also quarter mile times vary from 000 to 000 you cant tell exactly by the numbers  furthermore the integra will definately outrun the beretta on the high end  car  driver and road  track have the gsr doing 000 to 000 mph and it gets there fast        so the beretta can out handle the integra and it can certainly keep up with it in acceleration  and the beretta probably has a higher top speed due to the horsepower advantage 000000 hptorque for the integra vs 000000 for the beretta you always believe those exact numbers why dont you drive a gsr and see for your self while the gsr has a low 000 torqye its high gearing over a 0000 rpm make up for the difference still wouldnt call it a torque moster though       the biggest advantage would have to be the price  the integra costs 00000 as tested motor trend the gtz costs 00000 as tested  the gtz also has standard nicities and airbag and antilock brakes  an airbag is not available on the integra and lower models do not have abs considering you save almost 0000 dollars for the beretta and the quad0 is a reliable engine it doesnt make sense to get the integra as a performance coupe which is what people have been trying to make it out to be   quad 0 reliable yeah whats your definition of reliable if thats reliable then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect  not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter  balance shaftsthe acura has the engine    wins the reliablity contest hands down you can rev that car all day everyday and youll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else i speak from expierence im not saying the quad 0 is a bad engine but dont highlight reliability when you comparing it to a acura engine  and while the integra costs alot more it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better  and does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time  note this isnt a flame on the gtz or other gm quad 0 products  the berreta is a nice car and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable price not to mention it has an airbag  but to start quoting figures from one source isnt too reliable  read other sources and drive both cars  while i havent driven a gtz i have driven gts and grand ams with quad 0 engines so they are similair

  hello testing    
         my friend brought a subaru svx recently  i had drove it for couples times and i think its a great car esp on snow  however when she took it to a local subaru dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about 00 dollars  the dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour at first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price  so is there any svx owner out there that has the same problem   and if the oil change story is true then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me by the way the car looks great  swd wan   
  could someone out there please tell me how i could get onto the saab mailing list specifically i need the address and instructions on what to do  thanks in advance  pete

  ssaveolecdaccom the devil reincarnate writes  you will be surprised at the number of people who forget their glasses  while driving  and then there are the people who just plain dont get  their eyes checked once a year  as someone who has lousy vision i can see objects at a distance without my glasses however they are quite fuzzy and i may not be able to make out the details but i can certainly tell that something is there     i wont argue too much about anything  i am probably one of those that  think that we cant have enough safety on the roads  i would gladly  sacrifice distractions as you call it than someone having trouble seeing danger earlier  one saved life justifies more than my lifetime of distractions for me     and then there is dawn and dusk  when your eyes have not yet adjusted  to the poor light  and there are those who drive blackgrey cars and  then there is the case where you are driving down a twoway one lane   road and someone is overtaking cars and coming the opposite direction   doesnt see you because your lights are not on or vice versa  at 00mph   that is quite a small reaction time  but of course we are too macho to   think we are invincible and can react faster than that only the poor   sod who you didnt see might not have a normal life ever  i worked out the reaction time in a previous post and its plenty even for an 00 year old grandma as long as speeds are in the 00 mph range or less if you or some other driver is going way faster than that then be careful  as always you are responsible for your driving actions if you pull out to pass and crash into someone for whatever reason its your fault if you cant      problem is that i may just kill the guy i agree that i would be at fault and i will have my license revoked why i might even go to the gas chamber but the fact still remains that the guy is dead  someone died because i was too stingy to put on my lights    see a damn thing then you shouldnt be driving  lights fail fallen trees or rocks dont have lights etc  i maintain that headlight strength      the ratio of the probability of fallen treesrocks on the roads to  oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered  the difference is also working on what we know could happen to what might happen   running lights are not necessary for motorists who drive around 00mph it may be a good idea to force the running or headlights on when you turn your windshield wipers on but only because some people are too stupid to do so if you crash into one of those idiots you have to fight it out in court to show his neglegence if you can even prove it     just out of curiosity how much gasmilage do you loose when you put  your lights on  and how much do you reduce the life of your headlamps  and what is the cost of your headlamps anyway  mileage is certainly reduced but by a very very small amount probably about 000 watts for head and running lights this is an extra 00 horsepower that must be made by the engine it may be that this will cost you around two  gallons a year but times 000 million cars thats a lot of gas    compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by those 000 million cars it is miniscule     whatever  tis a pity i have to share the same roads with a person not concerned with safety  s ssaveolecdaccom   lamp life is measured in hours so if you normally drive in half daylight and half night your lamps will have to be replaced twice as often headlamps only cost about 00us for most halogen lamps  the cost to the individual is trivial and to me is not the issue what i dont like is the distractions all these cars with headlights cause i dont need to constantly see the headlights of the vehicle behind me i dont need to see the headlights of every gosh darn car for a mile down the road these lit up cars make nonilluminated things less visible like pedistrians and bikes hopefully were not going to mandate drls for people and bikes  too  a stream of taillights is tolerable as are the orange front running lights this is certainly sufficient for other people to see you if they look and doesnt distract me nearly as much as full power headlights  mark

  well there is a difference  i dont happen to have my sae manual handy but oil viscosity in general decreases with temperature  the sae numbers are based on a typical curve that oils used to all have running from say the viscosity of a roomtemperature 00weight at 0c down to say that of a roomtemperature  0weight at 00c for a typical 00weight oil  oils that are designed for operation in normal temperatures just have a weight specification  oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a w tacked on the end so in winter in a cold place youd stick 00w in your car in the winter and 00 in it in the summer to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year  modern multiviscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature as a result their viscosity graphs cross over several curves  a multivis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures a normal operating temperature and a cold one though i cant remember the numbers  in any event the weights do indicate a significant difference  remember that your engine is temperatureregulated by the thermostat and radiator or air fins most of the time  unless you overheat it or something  any weight of oil is better than no oil or than very old carbonized oil  thin oil wont in general lubricate as well at temperature thicker oil will like a 00w00 will lubricate better at temperature  but not as well during startup when most engine wear occurs    if youre planning on making long drives the 00w00 is probably fine esp in the summer in your 00w00 car  but if youre making short drives stick to the 00w00    dont drink soap dilute dilute ok

  cs000000csbrownedu hokchung tsang writes  in article c0vir0l0rshuksandsboeingcom freddshuksan fred dickey writes  carolinafanuiuc cka00000uxacsouiucedu wrote      the biggest problem some people seem to be having is that saturn   dealers make 0k on a car  i think most will agree with me that the car is   comparably priced with its competitors that is they arent overpriced    compared to most cars in their class  i dont understand the point of    arguing over whether the dealer makes the 0k or not      i have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is either  the only thing that i can figure out is that people believe that if  they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total outofpocket  expenses for the car while this may be true in some cases i do not  believe that it is generally true i bought a saturn sl in january of 00  at that time based on studying car prices i decided that there was  no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the saturn sure maybe i  could have talked the price for some other car to the saturn price but  my outofpocket expenses wouldnt have been any different whats important  to me is how much money i have left after i buy the car reducing dealer profit  is not the same thing as saving money show me how reducing dealer profit  saves me money and ill believe that its important my experience has  been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money    fred   say you bought your saturn at 00k with a dealer profit of 0k if the dealer profit is 0000 then you would only be paying 00k for the same car  so isnt that saving money  yes  but the point is that prices are competetive  saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a 0000 profit but  since a comperable honda with 000 profit is more expensive it may be well worth it to buy the saturn  moreover if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by 0000  then their cars will be even better deals  say if the price of a saturn was already 0000 below market average for the class of cars then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be 0000 below market average  it will  0 attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money   0 force the competitors to lower their prices to survive  now not only will saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even  the buyers for other cars will pay less   not necessarily  it seems to me that saturn salesdroids who dont  make a commision whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally do make more  per hour or whatever  this means that saturn doesnt give up the profit to their employees through commision which is taken out of per car profits  they just pass it along to less pressureing salesmenwomen  isnt that saving money  maybe  maybe not  depends on accounting practices  id rather pay more for dealer service that doesnt cut corners to contain costs   000 doug  0000 cka 00 carolina blue honda civic dx     chintan amin  the university of illinoisurbana champaign mail llamauiucedu  because he was human      because he had goodness      because he was moral they called him insane  peart cinderella man

   i am the person who started out this subject  to me the question really is not about dealer profit but the amount of money for the type of car ive settled with a new 00 subaru wagon with the similar amount of money a saturn dealer asked for a sw0 ok i know its a 00 model but i think i got a better car though i have to adjust my initial idea of  why i am getting a new car  today during a conversion with a friend i learned he rejected a saturn for a ford tarurs as it only costed him a little bit more than a sl0 i may be wrong but a loaded tarus beats a saturn sl0  i agree that a fullyloaded sl0 would come close in price to a lowerend ford taurus  a fullyloaded taurus on the other hand would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy sl0  a fully loaded sl0 would run somewhere around 00000 while a fully loaded taurus lx would be somewhere around the 0000000000 range  a base taurus gl i believe might start around 00000  of course there is the taurus sho which can push 00000 if you really try but this is a totally different car than your mainstream taurus sedan  your statement was not entirely faulty just a little inaccurate   i cant see saturn is of better value and that is why i was puzzled by its pricings oh we did not spend much time getting our deals being better informed has its advantages  well thats ok  at least youre not bitching about dealer profits like some of the other netters are  you seem to have rationally picked out the car that is best for you  the loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by the impreza wagon so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones   then again i may be wrong  yungkao hsu   mihir shah mps0cec0wustledu

  i cant imagine any civic or saturn owners flexn there egos in stop light races it generates as much excitement as two nerds challenging each other in a game of oneonone basketball  the sl0 does 000 in about 00 note that this is closer to a 000 than to a paseo or storm pseudosporty cars thats a ridiculous comparison i know but the point is that saturns and highend civics for that matter accelerate just fine in fact better than most unimproved muscle cars of the 00s 000 hp is great but tied to 0 tons it just doesnt go that quick saturns on the other hand use 000 hp tied to 0000 lbs with some short gearing to move very quickly off the line anyway     while your 000 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports i saw the pbs motorweek show clock a 0speed sl0 at 00 seconds  im sure that most sl0 owners will be very lucky to get this speed but 00 seconds is still astonishingly fast for a small 0door  a new civic ex runs about 00 seconds 000 if im not mistaken  most cars in this class are lucky to be in the 0second range   mihir shah

  apologies if this is a faq is there a faq posting for this group i am an infrequent reader of recautos so i cant remember  i am in the market for a used chevy suburban and have observed that prices for models with diesel engines run about 00000000 less than comparable models with a gas engine  there has to be a reason for this  yes there is  consumer confusion  in the early 00s with the fuel crisis etc everyone wanted better fuel mileage  diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines  so gm decided to conver their 000 gas engine into a diesel engine i think was a 00 liter  big mistake  the engine was not redesigned but converted  the engine could not handle the higher compression etc  lots of problems with these cars  this thew up a big red flag to the casual observer  dont buy a diesel  they are bad  this was a gross generalization  ask yourself this question  if your livelihood depended on driving lots of it would you use a dependable or undependable but cheaper in the short run vehicle  what do greyhound busses have in them trailer trucks  even train locomotives  are these gasoline engines no they are diesel  tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 000000 mile warrantee with they vehicles  i own an 00 diesel suburban  the 00l diesel is a great engine just keeps going  it was more expensive when new than the gasoline engine vehicle was  the only problem with diesel engines is that  when they need to be rebuilt they are expensive  in a gas 000 engine you will pay about 0000 for a rebuild  diesel 00l is about 0000  but then again the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 00 better mileage  a carburator for a gasoline engine costs about 000 to rebuild or less  a rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about 000 or more  but then again you never need a tuneup  if youre looking at a rebuilt 00l id say you got a great deal check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also  good luck  
   in your experience how true is it that a fuel injector cleaning will do much more good than just using detergent gas   while i agree that a clogged fuel injector would darken my day how clogged do they get and is 00 a good price or can i do it myself by buying a can of  what and doing  what   a fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than them opening your gas tank dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner and sending you on your merry way 00 poorer  go to kmart and buy the cleaner yourself for 000   just because you dealer sez you need it dont mean its necessarily so be suspicious   jim grey jwgacd0acdcom

  betschesterksuksuedu beth schwindt writes  this has me thinking  is there a biological reason why women cant put their keys in their pants pockets like men do  i have two pockets on the back of each of my pants  i put my keys in one and wallent in another many of the pockets even have a botton on them so i can close them securely everything is that much simpler for me  why cant women do the same is is biological ie not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and a wallet or is it the way they are raised by the parents   ive found that it has to do with the way womens clothes are made if you put keys in the front pocket of womens jeans or slacks you get a bulge that also tends to make it impossible to sit down because they stick you constantly  ditto in the back pocket  also try looking at the back pockets of womens jeans and compare them to the back pockets on mens jeans  they are usually if you buy jeans that you expect to last for any length of time about half the size  there flat out isnt room for a wallet or a bunch of keys  besides which where would men put all their crap if their wives didnt carry purses   the same place single men do wallet in back pocket comb in other back pocket keys in front pocket knive in other from pocket pen in shirt pocket or front pants pocket  or do married men start carrying around a bunch of stuff to keep there women happy  beth mark b

  i know its a long shot but maybe someone went through this and will have some comments to share  the story is this i bought a car out of state and im trying to get the safety inspection in pennsylvania the problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield the tint is rather weak and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint  the inspection garage said that they wont pass it unless i get a waiver from the state police so i went to the state police  the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal and i can get a waiver only for a pre00 car or for a medical reason i asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says its illegal  he showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you cant have tint if you cant see the inside of the car because of the tint when i told him that you can in fact see the inside very well he shut the book and said its just illegal and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now well wont argue with that  since the vehicle code says its ok as long as you can see through the tint id like to keep it ill reread the vehicle code in the library  id also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says its ok so i can get the inspection and so that i wont get in trouble for the tint later on i also wouldnt mind registering a complaint against that officer  he really pissed me off  so does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police especially in pennsylvania does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer i called the station  later on today but they basically said there is no place where i could register a complaint against an officer and if i do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway how much of a chance do i stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court  any comments about it will be welcome  michal

   quad 0 reliable yeah whats your definition of reliable if thats reliable then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect  not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter  balance shaftsthe acura has the engine    wins the reliablity contest hands down you can rev that car all day everyday and youll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else i speak from expierence im not saying the quad 0 is a bad engine but dont highlight reliability when you comparing it to a acura engine  and while the integra costs alot more it is a  a couple of things  blowing a hose doesnt speak of engine reliability and  while it is true that quad0s have a problem with head gasket leaks that was a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected  also i know pontiac is replacing head gaskets that leak for free for 0year00k miles  other than that i have found my quad0 to be completely solid and the direct ignition  system means no wiresrotorrotorcap to ever deal with  also hydrolic lifters mean no valve adjustments ever  im not badmouthing the integra engine i just think you are going overboard on slamming the quad0  you are quite correct that the integra engine is quieter although i would not say smoother my quad0 loves to rev especially at the highend  do you have any evidence of blocks cracking on quad0s  i have not heard of this

    my friend brought a subaru svx recently  i had drove it for couples times and i  think its a great car esp on snow  however when she took it to a local subaru  dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about 00 dollars  the dealer  told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to  disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour  at first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto  but found out the they are charging roughly the same price  so is there any  svx owner out there that has the same problem   and if the oil change story is  true then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me by the way the car  looks great    labour prices for car service are very expensive in toronto compared to other parts of ontario  for example there are places in ottawa that still charge only 00hour  ive seen a couple of places charging 00hour  the cheapest ive heard in toronto is 00hour   swd wan      doug zolmer           internet dwjzbnrca         disclaimer my opinions only bellnorthern research ltd  ottawa ontario canada          conform moooo

  moreover if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by 0000  then their cars will be even better deals  say if the price of a saturn was already 0000 below market average for the class of cars then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be 0000 below market average  it will  0 attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money  0 force the competitors to lower their prices to survive  but what is saturns motivation here  theyre already selling every car they make with multiple shifts in the plant  given this what possible motivation could they have to lower prices  cheers   richard   richard welty        0000000000       weltycabotballtowncmacom nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of   a race car about either its pitch or roll axis   carroll smith

   in a previous article dh0qandrewcmuedu daniel u holbrook says  im guessing but i believe in the twenties we probably drove mostly down cattle trails and in wagon ruts  i am fairly sure that placement of the  steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time  by the 0000s there was a very active good roads movement which had its origins actually in the 0000s during the bicycle craze picked up steam in the teens witness the linclon highway association 0000 or so and the us highway support act real name something different in 0000 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads also the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during ww 0 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense  anyway by the 00s there were plenty of good roads at least around urban areas and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside  this was the era after all of the first auto touring fad the motel the auto camp ground etc two good books on the subject spring to mind  warren belasco america on the road title may not be exact  author is and another called the devil wagon in gods country author i forget  also any of john flinks  or john bell raes auto histories  im sorry as i have never heard of any of this  guess they dont think its important enough for a classroom and i was going on what ive seen in picssome moviesreal nice scource there huh  i just always  recall thinking that good roads of asphalt didnt come around til the interstate hiway act or whatever they called it00s and that wood and cobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression except in overpopulated places like england and us cities  obviously netwisdom says i am wrong  as to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary by the early teens there were virtually no american cars that did not have the wheel on the left  in the early days cars had the wheel on the left on the right and even in the middle as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel  this was standardized fairly early on though i dont know why  i knew it was almost always done but i knew of no reason that it might not be done the other way by desoto for their car  seems like they had some other deviations from the norm too at times   dan dh0qandrewcmuedu carnegie mellon university applied history  world history strides on from catastrophe to catastrophe whether we can comprehend and prove it or not                oswald spengler  thanx for corrrecting me and again i aplogize for harebraned post drew

    i agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass you might  not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you dont want to  give them that one carlength when they should just wait like you are  but if youre one of those people that just sits behind the person and  doesnt flash them with the high beams or pull left and flash them or  ride their bumper or otherwise tell them that you do in fact want to   go by and youre not just drafting them then get the hell out of the   way of someone who will  i especially hate it when you flash someone at  the back of a line and they dont pass it on    and theres also the issue of some cars being more intimidating to get   people out of the way than others  for instance 0000 gts look   pretty mean in a rearview mirror at night with the foglights on    there have been plenty of times when ive broken up a pack that a   secondinline hyundai has been behind for miles  you just need to  know how to get their attention   id like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers if they see you they usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle finger extended because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane ahead                                                            hhm

  i consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer  the design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an eeprom  the idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the eeprom  the secondary purpose acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the eeprom being used the microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the hall effect at a rate any higher than 000 mph so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable  this was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 000 mph in operation  the case of course might not be the same for your 0000 rx0  the ecm modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated  since steering angle and velocity data etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers use of the car  i am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ecm  while it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars i personally wouldnt mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion     bill mayhew      neoucom computer services department rootstown oh  000000000  usa    phone 0000000000 wtmuhuraneoucomedu 00000000    000000 n0wed

  howdy  im a little new to this newsgroup but i would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here  the subject  aftermarket cruise controls  the background i recently broke my ankle in a roadbicycling accident 0 places five  screws yuk    in two weeks i will be returning to texas my home from my school byu in provo utah  as you can imagine trying to drive nearly 0000 miles with a broken right ankle isnt just the epitome of a good time  my car does not have a cruise control so i would have to do all the pedalling ha ha with my messedup ankle  my question what is the general opinion of aftermarket cruise control units  i realize that a cheap cc cruise control from say pep boys isnt going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit if there is such a thing  and i uderstand that i probably cant expect much in the way of accuracy looks and that sort of thing  but anythings gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle  i have a 0000 jeep cherokee 0 speed standard 00 00l engine with ketteringsp ignition yknow distributor cap rotor that setupnot electronic  maybe you couldve guessed it being an 00 but im just trying to give information as completly as i can  i found a cc unit for 00 bucks  it seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servormotor  is this good or bad  if i did buy this cc which vacuum hose should i tap  it has two speed sensors  one magnetic and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pickup or so i understand  i can use either one  which is best  the manual says i read it in the store today that the magneticaxle setup is more accurate but harder to install  is there really a big difference  it has a sensor for the brake pedal just like other ccs but does not have a sensor for the clutch pedal  so if i wasnt paying real close attention i might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up  which would wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned  the thing off  im pretty coordinated so this doesnt bother me if it were for my girlfriends car then it would bother me but im ok with it  the installation also calls for an attachment to a steadyon brake signal and a switchedon brake signal  i think i can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse  am i right  but im not sure where to get the steadyon brake signal or for that matter what exactly it is  any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it  i think i can figure the other things out  like how to hookup the negative side tachtype sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit and the ground and all that miscellaneous business  but i need a little help with  0  is it worth the money and safety risk if any for such a     device 0  is there any particularly good aftermarket cc 0  are professionally installed ccs signifacantly better and     worth the cabbage 0  if the unit i saw sorry no manufacturer or model number just     that it is at pep boy and its 00 is sufficient for my simple      needs how do i get the thing installed properly specifically     the questions above  my father and i built a veep volkswagen powered jeep cj0a when i was in high school so i consider myself fairly good with tools electronics and cars  so the installation doesnt scare me  i just want to be certain that i get the thing installed correctly as my cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my veep   i appreciate your time in reading my post and i would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject  if you would like to share some of your wisdom please email as i dont get over this group very often but i check my mail all the time  again thanks for any help anyone may have  mike wieda mikewcancbyuedu

  i have a 00 chevy sprint with ac and 0doors its odometer turned 00k and the sensor light started blinking i went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying i need to change the oxygen sensor he said it is to be changed every 00k but since i bought the car when it had 00k i dont know if the same thing happened at 00k and 00k  he quoted 000 for the part and 00 to install it the part cost 00 outside but the mechanic i went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts he suggested i wait till it malfunctions before i do anything  if anyone out there owns a chevy sprint i want to know how they got their oxygen sensors changed also did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealers help also what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction    any help would be greatly apprecisted    thanks       nagesh

  vervaeke writes      experience with jeep service dept   while not exactly a service incident i had a similar experience recently   when i bought a new truck  i had picked out the vehicle i wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price i wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them id be back that evening to pick up the truck   when i returned i had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me when i finally got in there everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers he then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax  license by about 000 he then said he needed   another 000 from me i said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem i wasnt giving them any more money the finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time i   reminded him that i was the customer and i didnt think i should be   treated like that and that if he didnt back off he could forget the whole   deal he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick it   snatched back my check and left needless to say they were not pleased by   the turn of events  early the next morning i got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened i related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind i told him   that if they gave me the truck for free i probably still wouldnt take it   that there were other dealers in town i was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customersetcetci was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair he gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution etc etc i told   him not to bother thanks id go somewhere else  a couple hours later the owner of the dealership called me all   apologetic etc etc etc and said that they would cover the 000 plus   knock another 000 off the price of the truck i told him id think about   it and he gave me his private direct phone number his secretarys name   and assured me that they valued me as a customer etc etc etc  i thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided what the hellthat was a pretty decent deal so i called him   back and accepted his offer when i went back the next day to pick up the   truck i received the royal treatment everyone seemed to know about the   incident even the lot boy everything went smoothly and i was out of   there in my new truck in about 00 mins  so i guess im a reasonably satisfied customer however it should not   have happened in the first place i was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that i dont expect them to bow and grovel but i   sure dont expect to be given a hard time either esp when its their   mistake  anyway im happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first years license fee   im not sure whether ill go back to that dealer tho  mark

  archivename recautospart0  most recent changes 00 march 0000 addition of altautoskarting  rpw                  welcome to recautos   this article is sent out automatically each month and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups and some suggested guidelines for discussions  the keywords monthly posting will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities  this article is posted to all autos groups but followups are directed only to recautos  if you dont understand what this means ask your system administrator for help or at least for copies of the newuser documentation  failing that please subscribe to the newsgroup newsannouncenewusers and read the documentation provided there  introduction to the recautos newsgroup hierarchy  recautostech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles their design construction diagnosis and service  other discussions are largely inappropriate especially for sale ads  recautossport  is intended for discussion of legal organized competition involving automobiles  technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles  discussion from either of two viewpoints spectator and participant is encouraged  arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate as are most other discussions  for sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles andor equipment discussions of illegal events are marginal one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law  remember the fbi reads usenet  recautosdriving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles also if you must discuss 00 vs 00 or radar detectors or insert your pet driving peeve boneheads do it here  recautosvw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen this includes vws audis seats etc  it was created on the grounds that the infovw mailing list was very successful  it should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such as a mailing list  recaudiocar  is not properly part of the recautos hierarchy  it is however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so is mentioned here  recautosantique  is intended for the discussion of older cars usually more than 00 years old although this is not a hardandfast rule  althotrod  is not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the recautos reader  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles  altautosrodncustom  also not part of the official hierarchy devoted to that peculiar american hobby of customizing older cars  altautoskarting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting  recautos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics   crossposting  crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the newsgroups line in the article header such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed  crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on usenet  you should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience  this distinction is subtle but important  radar detector articles for example are moreorless appropriate in recautos  they are almost never appropriate in scielectronics or rechamradio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in scielectronics or rechamradio is not adequate justification for posting to either group  crossposting between any or all of the recautos groups is usually inappropriate if you find yourself doing so consider whether or not it is truly advisable before sending your article  consider setting followupto to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost  crossposting between recautos and miscconsumers is chancy at best in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us andor the use of radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups  most readers of scielectronics and recradio couldnt care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in recautos  it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups and followupto  lines of articles before posting a followup  in particular be wary of posting to misctest recartsstartrek or talkbizarre or any combination of these three  the life you save may be your own  distribution  there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to partially control where the article goes it is called the distribution field  it may be very useful for many reasons it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system  the distribution of recautos is fairly extensive  as of this writing  the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe australia new zealand and some locations in japan  with this in mind i offer the following hints about use of the distribution field in your article headers and on article content  0 please take care not to send forsale ads about clapped out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason likes mavericks but only 0door mavericks at that  0 when posting technical questions please include the market for which your car was manufactured  for example there are a number of differences between a europeanmarket ford escort and a usmarket escort  likewise all 0000cc and early 0000cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel injection european market cars usually got carbs often webers  these differences can be important to your readers make your situation clear failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation  0 be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values whereas europe is almost entirely on the metric system  a future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonlyused abbreviations that may not be known in some places that recautos reaches this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it  0 use the distribution field to limit where your article goes when possible  within north america the values na north america can canada and usa may be used  in addition the twoletter state abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases eg if i wanted to send an article only to new york and new jersey i could put nynj in a distribution field  note that multiple commaseparated values are legal  these distribution fields vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area  the dangers of overgeneralization  to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars tires etc  what is true for a 0000 buick with a 000cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 0000 honda with a 0000cc engine  headlight laws in sweden are decidedly different from those in idaho  the need for adequate specification  when you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information eg if you have a question about your honda please specify year model engine size etc  otherwise most answers to your question may be quite useless   concerning lemons  at one time or another every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two even honda admits to this  please dont waste everyones time by announcing to the world that your brand x automobile is terrible so all brand x automobiles are terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x company  such articles are worse than useless because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information   concerning flames  as much as we might wish it a flamefree newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur  here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them a list of flameprone topics follows in the next section of this posting  if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory dont imagine for a minute that including the words no flames will work  it wont and youll get exactly what you deserve  if youre going to flame youre more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a wellknown reference  no one is likely to believe bald unsupported assertions  be careful about who you choose to insult  consider not insulting anyone   asking the question  it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please send email i dont read this group  it is a much better idea to end the question with please send email if there is sufficient interest ill summarize the results in a later posting  i may miss posted responses to this request  answering the question  if someone wants to hop up their yugo dont tell them to get a mustang either be silent or give them useful advice  if someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket dont tell them to obey the law next time  its offensive presumes guilt which is not proven and doesnt directly address the original question  in general dont post in order to see your words in print and dont post in order to enjoy feeling smug and selfrighteous   stale andor inflammatory topics  certain topics are considered stale by old timers while discussion of them is certainly ok and new factual information is welcome ravings about them are extremely tiresome and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether  some topics are naturally inflammatory it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them  some of these topics include the following  0  the 00mph speed limit in the us pro and con  0  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors  0  discussions over which radar detector is best  0  discussions over what is a sports car this is one reason why     recautossport is not a sports car group  everyone would argue     about what constitutes a sports car  0  disputes over whether or not us federal law protects the drivers     right to own and operate a radar detector  0  buy american discussions  0  clever bumper stickers and personalized license plates  0  insert nationality here cars are terrible  0  what kind of car did maxwell smart drive       when i have a complete accurate answer it will be added to the           commonlyasked questions article which is also posted monthly           until then please dont waste bandwidth on this topic  rpw    please direct comments and suggestions about this article

  archivename recautospart0  this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast and so is not crossposted to miscconsumers   rpw     changes as of 00 april 0000 revised brake fluid section as     nonsilicone dot0 fluids are now apparently available  rpw                   commonly asked automotive questions   tire questions  q  what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean  a  typically you will see something like 00000hr00  the 000 is the     overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually     narrower  the 00 is the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width  our example tire     has a sidewall height of 000  000  000 mm  the 00 is the wheel     diameter in inches there are also some special tires called trx     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like     000 which is in millimeters  the r means radial and the h is a speed     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly     inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate  common     speed ratings are s 000mph t 000mph h 000mph and v up to     000mph      recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed     rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find     designations like 00000r00 00h the 00 indicates the pertire load     associated with the speed rating  exceeding this load in continuous     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice  what follows is     a table showing a number of load indices and corresponding maximum     pertire loads      load index       00   00   00   00   000   000   000   000   000     max load kg   000  000  000  000  0000  0000  0000  0000  0000      note that the usual mass vs weight confusion occurs in this table      in some cases the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire     size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation     indicates passenger car  if no letter is given then the application     of the tire is passenger car usage  as far as i know these letters     only appear in the us market  the lt designation is prinicipally of     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles  for     the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference     between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at     all      if the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably 00 but may be 00      tires with an ms mudsnow designation may have their speed rating     reduced by 00 kmh about 00mph      there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature     traction and treadwear  temperature and traction are graded     a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is     a numeric rating  these values are of limited value as they     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires  q  my car has tires with a funny size designation  00000hr000 can i put     normal tires on the car  a  your tires are called trx tires they were devised by michelin     because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible     with normal tires michelin used a different diameter wheel for them     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that     more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels     you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your     car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels and horribly     dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner     or possibly blow out at high speed  trx type tires are becoming hard     to find in addition to michelin avon makes suitable tires  goodyear     has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires  q  can i rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side     of my car  a  car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many     say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a     car is now ok this group includes michelin and goodyear others     for example pirelli and nokia will void warranties if such swapping     is done  the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before     rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturers recommendations  q  how many snow tires should i buy and if i buy 0 which end of the     car should i put them on  a  in short 0 and both ends  to explain many drivers in areas that dont     get excessive snow or who dont drive agressively or at all in snow     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice  with a rear     wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car     going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car     a function of the front axle  in a front wheel drive car you start     stop and turn with the front end  the primary risk of putting the     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes     while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards  radar detectors and speed limits  q  why arent there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits     in this qa posting  a  because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between     miscconsumers and recautos always start long tedious and pointless     flame wars  if you want to talk about either of these topics please     subscribe to recautos or altflame and keep it there  safety equipment  q  do airbags really work  a  preliminary statistics suggest the following  airbags work much     better than no belts good 0 point belts alone work much better than     airbags alone and airbags  0 point belts work slightly better than     0 point belts alone  the con to airbags is that some designs tend     to burn the drivers hands when venting the byproducts of the     explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but     not all may knock the drivers hands from the wheel making retention     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult  brake questions  q  do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned  midas     always wants to do this  a  no  there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing     rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors     more often than is strictly necessary  if the rotors are not warped     warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or     to turn them  note also that some rotors the rotors on many hondas     are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical     to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped     or badly grooved  q  they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down  is     this really a good idea  a  it used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade     prone drum brakes  in modern disc brake equipped cars use of     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases     of long steep downhill runs  otherwise modern disc brakes are more     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings      on the other hand many standard drivers license tests in the usa     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking i     suggest that before taking a us drivers test you either 0 learn to     do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or 0 borrow a     car with an automatic to take the test  q  how often should i replace my brake fluid  a  probably more often than you do  traditional brake fluids tend to     absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid  dot0 type     are older fluids dot0 and dot0 are newer specifications  the     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling     point is important in older brake fluid  dot0 fluids have the lowest     wet and dry boiling point requirements dot0 fluids have better     boiling point requirements and dot0 fluids have the best boiling     point requirements but dot0 fluids are not clearly superior see     the next qa for more details  while the requirements imply that     dot0 fluids are better than dot0 fluids there may be specific     cases where a dot0 fluid is preferable but these are mostly     competition applications  otherwise dot0 type fluids offer much     improved brake pedal feel  replacement once a year is recommended for     dot0 fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out     fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly  q  what about dot0 brake fluids  a  this breaks down in to two parts  the dot0 specification looks     excellent for performance but the first dot0 fluids were silicone     based  silicone fluids are a tricky proposition  unlike dot0 and     dot0 fluids they do not absorb water at all  while this may sound     like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in     such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring  the water will tend     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where     most of the corrosion occurs      because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to     silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly     beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the     brake system when converting to silicone fluids      two other issues that come up with silicone fluids  0 they are     difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and 0 while they     generally have much higher boiling points than dot0 fluids they     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable     in effect from boiling dot0 fluids  silicone fluids may make sense     in some street car applications but they are certainly not     recommended for high performance driving applications and the     economics are questionable for street use      i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot0 standard     that do not contain silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably     compatible with the older dot0 and dot0 fluids but i have little     information at this time  q  abs is available on some of the cars im looking at but it costs     more  is it worth it  a  this does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will     be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons  the short answer     is that abs costs more both initially and to maintain will generally     work better for the average driver that is to say a driver who does     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques     and may require the unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case      now for the long answer  abs works by monitering the wheels of the     car looking for signs of locked brakes  it may or may not be able     be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several     systems on the market  it cannot detect impending lockup which is     what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence     of lockup  the sensors used vary some of the less well designed     sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original     equipment or oeequivalent components      when the sensors detect lockup the abs system responds by unlocking     the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the     system  if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the abs     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a     sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could     sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is     achieved  this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as     the system cycles  the percentage of the time that the brakes are     truly engaged is called the duty cycle typically in an abs system     this is about 00  on dry pavement a trained driver can beat this     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking     on wet pavement braking is so chancy that abs will outperform     threshold braking nearly every time  unfortunately on mud and on     snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes     locked only audi of the manufacturers producing absequipped cars     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this     eventuality      a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves     steering control  this is the case simply because if you are     braking near the limit and turn the wheel the abs will release     the brakes if it sees steeringtriggered lockup and back off     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied     braking distances will lengthen accordingly      an important caution  abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical     braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on     glare ice dont expect an abs system to help you out very much     the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an     abs system in your car      as far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential     restrictions ive listed above you have to worry about the     following  0 parts costs are much higher the oe master cylinder     for my obscure european sedan lists for 000 but the oe master     cylinder for the absequipped version of the same car lists for     over 0000  most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot0     silicone brake fluids in absequipped vehicles  because of     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system     components regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid     becomes very important  q  what about this threshold braking business  a  normally id not put this in the consumers qa but recent     publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers     in absequipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is     needed here  rpw      threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high     performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab     the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely and is much     to be prefered  basically the premise is that tires generate     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but     just before the wheels lock up entirely  drivers who threshold     brake learn to feel what this threshold feels like and learn     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake     pedal  in many cars you can feel that you are near the     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it     in any case if you cant hear the tires whine just a bit youre     not very near the threshold      in a car with abs often there is a twinge in the pedal just     before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very     close to the threshold and theyll probably achieve better     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs     take over      recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of     accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with     abs systems  the police departments in question quickly blamed     the new abs systems but according to autoweek magazine it now     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the     involved officers had any recent performance driving training     there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing     brake pedal by pump braking an old and discredited technique     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system  if you     think about it for a minute youll realize that pump braking must     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least     00 so if you cut the 00 duty cycle of an abs system by that     much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason     threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs if     you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at     the pedal will be sufficient      gas questions  q  does high octane gasoline help  a  maybe maybe not  some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the     engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used     on most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your     car run well  check your owners manual for details on what your car     needs  q  my car was made for leaded gasoline  will unleaded gas hurt it  a  it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear     although the amoco oil company argues otherwise  the actual increase     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded     gasolines actually contain very little lead  you should however     check your owners manual many cars from the early 0000s do not     actually require leaded gasoline  q  do fuel treatments help  what kind should i use  a  some do and some dont  during the winter it is a good idea to use     dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems     never use an additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl     alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection      manufacturers opinions vary on additives containing ethanol sometimes     called ethyl alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owners     manual on your car before  using these  most manufacturers consider     00 ethanol acceptable in gasoline  additives with isopropyl alcohol     isopropanol and petroleum  distillates are fine in fuel injected     cars      an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with     fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that     do the same job  some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain     ethanol or methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything     in your gas tank      there are a small number of particularly good additives these are     noticeably more expensive that the runofthemill ones but work     much much better  among these are chevron techron redline sl0     wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg 00k  a bottle of one of these     once every six months is highly recommended  q  what about detergent gasolines  a  the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat bmw     has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this     test may advertise that fact  stickers indicating passage of the test     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations  if such     gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional     beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean     engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits  lubrication questions  q  what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean  a  there are several different items encoded  there is a twoletter     code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer     uses in the oil this looks like sesfcd or such  the s codes are     for gasoline engine applications the c codes are for diesel engine     applications  the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels     of protection are developed thus sf is considered better than se     se is considered better than sd and so forth      the more noticeable designation is the oil weight  this is either     a single number eg 00 weight or a pair of numbers separated by     the letter w eg 00w00  the latter type is much more commonly     used these days and are the only type that most automobile     manufacturers specify in operators manuals  the first number in the     designation 00w is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold     the w stands for winter  the second number 00 is the viscosity     of the oil when hot  there is a trick here the oil doesnt actually     get thicker turn from 00 weight to 00 weight as it gets hotter  what     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity     of a cold 00 weight oil  as it gets hotter it doesnt get thin as fast     as a 00w oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the     viscosity of a hot 00 weight oil      note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not     all 00w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all     00 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot  note also that the     novel behaviour of multigrade oils is caused by additives and it has     been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx 00w00 oils     do not retain their multigrade characteristics well over time  00w00     00w00 and 00w00 oils work very well though  q  are quick lube places any good  a  some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out     there  let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure     that they dont overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on     your wallet at all times  q  are oil additives like slick00 or tufoil any good  a  slick00 and tufoil are ptfebased additives  many of these have     come onto the market recently they are different from the molybased     additives that have been around since the early 00s  ptfe is the     chemical name for teflontm a trademark owned by dupont in general     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products  most usenet     responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight     increase of mpg after application smoother revving but long term     results whether ptfe additives are effective after 0k miles are     debatable  some manufacturers such as saab claim that either the     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage  some bmw owners     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of     slick 00 to their cars  this writer has been cautioned by a slick00     dealer  that slick00 should not be used in japanese motors as     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine  otherwise there are     no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives      on the other hand there are satified slick 00 customers in the world  q  do synthetic oils really work  a  yes but  more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics     but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by     oil manufacturers  auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your     car  even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change     the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty     as conventional oils      synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter     entirely amsoil redline and agip are very highly regarded and very     effective  mobil 0 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however  q  manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals     how often should i change my oil  a  it depends on how you drive  if your car always or nearly always     gets warmed up and you dont drive it very hard and keep the revs     down the manufacturers recommendation is probably fine  if however     you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesnt get up     to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often     perhaps at 0000 mile intervals given that most manufacturers are     now specifying 0000 mile intervals  if you dont drive your car     much at all say 0000 miles a year then you probably want to change     oil every six months anyway  if you are storing a car during the winter     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out     of storage  misc questions  q  my car has a timing belt  i hear that bad things happen when they     break  whats the story  a  it depends on the internal design of the motor  early ford escorts     for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt     some honda motors will not be damaged but others will be      if no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the     belt at least every 00000 miles some cars may require more frequent     replacement  ask your dealer or independent mechanic  also ask if     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time     for example the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have     a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize     destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage     as a side effect  replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water     pump can be a costly mistake  q  why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it     self destructs when the timing belt breaks  a  for performance reasons  compromising piston design so that the     valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance     oriented vehicles  q  what causes unintended acceleration  a  the final report of the national highway transportation and safety     administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the     same time be consistent with the physical evidence  the nhtsa report     goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator     is probably the cause   richard welty        0000000000       weltycabotballtowncmacom nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of   a race car about either

  i saw an interesting product in ny auto show and would like to  hear your comments  militechtm is yet another oil additive but the demonstration of this product really impressive if it didnt cheat  the setup of the demo is fairly simple a cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink filled with motor oil the rotor is powered by an electronic motor a metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction  the torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench  before militech was added the rotor was stopped with about 00 lbft of torque you pick the brand of oil no difference once militech was  added to the oil the rotor could not be stopped even with 000 lbft of torque   here is the good part even after the salesman emptied the oil sink  you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it  they say you need only add 0oz per quart of oil every 00k miles a 00 oz bottle is 00  i still have my doubts if this product is really so great why it was so little known the salesman said it is widely used in military i didnt believe it  the demo was so impressive that i bought a bottle against my common sense  has anyone heard of or actually used this product is it real if you are going to the auto show please visit this stand on the  second floor see if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not  jason chen

  archivename recautospart0  this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions of general consumer interest and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to miscconsumers  rpw  last change 0 february 0000 ct now permits radar detector usage     new tiretraction qa  rpw                  commonly asked questions  radar questions  q  where are radar detectors illegal  a  in the us currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors  new york prohibits their use in     large trucks  in canada they are illegal in manitoba ontario     quebec newfoundland and pei prince edward island  they     are apparently are illegal through most if not all of europe     legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal  q  where are radar detector detectors used  do they really work  a  usage is spreading rapidly initially they were used only in canada     but now they are appearing in new york and virginia  it is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in connecticut and dc     they work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super het radar detectors some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others and are thus more likely to be spotted     new radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors  note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on  q  what is vascar  is it some kind of radar  a  vascar is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and timespeeddistance     computer  it depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks  no radar signals are emitted by a vascar     system  q  what is ka band radar  where is it used  should a radar detector be     able to handle it   a  ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us     in socalled photoradar installations  in these installations a     lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a 00 degree angle to the     direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit     tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle  because of the low     power and the 00 degree angle many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway  the number of locales where photoradar is in use     is limited and some question the legality of such units  best advice     learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they     are used or else dont speed  q  do radar jammers work  are they legal  a  quick answer  no and not in the usa     detailed answer  cheap radar jammers do not work well at all     jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military  jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     federal communications commission of the usa  driving technique and vehicle dynamics questions  q  what are understeer and oversteer  a  understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the limit limit of adhesion that is     most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter  simply put they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less     or understeer or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer     understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast wont get into     trouble  understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner  oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars it may be induced by lifting on the throttle trailing     throttle oversteer or tto  in extreme cases lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning      some technical details  in a corner at speed the tires on the car     will develop what are called slip angles the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel  in understeer the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels  in oversteer the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels  q what is a revmatched downshift  a when downshifting the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear  however during a downshift normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop    rather than increase  in revmatched downshift you blip the throttle    before reengaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed  this results in a much smoother and faster downshift  q what does heelandtoe mean  a heelandtoe is a technique used to do a revmatched downshift while    braking  this is normally challenging because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle  it is called heelandtoe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift  in many modern cars this is a misnomer    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle     note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplishing    the same thing  q what is doubleclutch downshifting  a while your right foot is doing the above your left foot can do one of    three things  nothing declutch once or declutch twice  the reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine  this is usually coupled with    revmatching so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up     the procedure is as follows    0 declutch    0 move gearshift lever to neutral    0 engage clutch    0 match revs    0 declutch    0 move gearshift lever to next lower gear    0 engage clutch     this sounds like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural    the problem that doubleclutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox  in transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros doubleclutching makes it much easier to shift    basically if you doubleclutch well you are not using the synchros at    all  this is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition  q what do the numbers for acceleration from 000 00 mile skidpad and    slalom times in the auto magazines really mean  may they be compared  a in short 0 not as much as the magazines want you to believe and    0 almost never     in more detail  the acceleration numbers 000mph and 00 mile times    in the us may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source  testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a road  track number to a car  driver number is quite    pointless  keep in mind too that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the    major part of the equation     skidpads vary and even if they didnt skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires they change radically    when tire compounds change  do not make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of say two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers    this is not to suggest that skidpads are without value however skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools  they are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires     slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts of the    automobiles transient response  however they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corners of the    cars envelope  they do not tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision  for example they dont tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes offcamber  when a car    has an adjustable suspension these tests are usually done in the sport    setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving  the list of    caveats could go on for page after page  q my buddy claims that wide tires dont make any difference according    to his freshman physics textbook and that you cant ever accelerate    or corner at more than 00g  does he know what hes talking about  a 0 in short  he hasnt got a clue     0 in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth  dry and nondeformable    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature     pavement is never smooth it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent  tires which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over  in a tire    at operating temperature grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term  the colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually reverting to liquid which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking    this latter though is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving so unless youre a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving dont worry about it     because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 00g and race cars corner and brake at more than    00g  because simple friction does not apply it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip  an actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as finite element analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism  misc questions  q  what does name or acronym stand for  a  here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked     about be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names     as misinformation abounds on the net  in particular never     ask in rechumor if you want a useful result      saab   svenska aeroplan a b               or the swedish airplane corporation      alfa   societa anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili               or the lombardy automobile manufacturing company      fiat   fabbrica italiana di automobili torino               or the italian automobile manufacturers of turin      bmw    bayerische motoren werke               or bavarian motor works      mg     morris garage   q  does vw own porsche  a  no  porsche is a publicly held company controlled by the porsche and     piech families  porsche has extensive business dealings with vwaudi     which causes some confusion  since currently porsche is in some     financial difficulty there is a possibility that mercedes or vw may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future but this     is only speculation at this time   richard welty        0000000000       weltycabotballtowncmacom nothing good has

  this happened about a year ago on the washington dc beltway snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass  four or five cars were hit  there were several serious injuries and sadly a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck  in the head by one of the larger rocks  i dont recall if she  made it but i think she was comatose for a month or so and  doctors werent holding out hope that shed live  what the hell is happening to this great country of ours  i can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but 00 pound rocks  has our society really stooped this low  erik velapold  society as we have known it it coming apart at the seams the basic reason is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is no big deal kids see hundreds on murderous acts on tv we can abort  children on demand and kill the sick and old at will so why be surprised when some kids drop 00 lbs rocks and kill people they dont care because the message they hear is life is cheap  at

  is clear coat really worth it  yes on the showroom floor the cars have this deep lustrous shine that just cant be found on paint jobs that arent clear coated  on the other hand it seems that every clear coated car that ive seen on the road in a parking lot etc has fine scratches throughout the paint job  as does alas my 0000 laser  several weeks ago i had my car professionally polished and waxed when i picked it up it had that same showroom shine that i remember from a year ago when i bought it  several days ago i took my car to the dealership for some work  as an added bonus they washed my car  unfortunately whoever washed it either didnt get the roof which is black the rest of the car is red completely clean before he dried it or he used a dirty towel  now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that arent really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle  i am to put it mildy somewhat peeved about this  do i have any  chance of getting the dealership to do something about this my guess is no  is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem  or am i faced with the prospect of having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches information commiseration and sympathy all greatly appreciated     scott thedealershipwillneverwashmycaragain borders sbordersnyxcsduedu bordersscotttandemcom

   neil williams writes    as long as were on the subject several years ago myself and two others were riding in the front of a toyota pickup heading south on interstate 0 north of seattle wa someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our windshield not by accident im sure it was impossible to get up to the overpass quickly to see who did it we figured it was kids reported it and left a couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company he was in his midfourties and left behind a wife and children turned out there was a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away they caught the 00 year old that did it they put a cover over the overpass what else could they do i dont think ill over forget this story neil williams boeing computer services bellevue wa       neil what did they do to the 00yearold who they caught  what did  the mans insurance company do  this could be significant and in any case  very interesting    followups to altparentsteens    fred w bach     operations group          internet musicerichtriumfca  triumf triuniversity meson facility      voice  0000000000 loc 000000  0000 wesbrook mall ubc campus              fax    0000000000  university of british columbia vancouver bc canada   v0t 0a0   these are my opinions which should only make you read think and question  they do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer or fellow workers  
  wrt performance converter lockup is purely irrelevant  the lockup only occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve mpg  mind you a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving mpg but the additional mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration vs locked converter clutch than its inherent losses take away  the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions  i get much stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup which i can induce by briefly lifting off  then quickly but not too quickly to trigger a kickdown applying throttle  above 0000 rpms the convertor will never unlock  it would kickdown first  who says theres no skill involved in driving an automatic  i think of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal  with my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my right foot while having both hands to steer   eliot

forecast calls for thunder00 tbird sc    its a hell of a thing killing a man you take away all he has and all hes ever gonna have will munny unforgiven  00   i am beyond the under 00 age group but i have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you  i owned a 0000 toyota celica gt  i decided to buy myself a gift  a more exotic car  front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche 000 0000 model years i narrowed it down to those two  i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche  the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance  almost a personal luxury car  it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 000 i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 000 but i decided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way  i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car   if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the 00 celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be 0 years newer  our lowerrisk division will continue to handle your account   if you buy the porsche 000 well have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double  and if you go with a 000 its another story again  well cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that   but the supra is much faster than the 000 and the 000 is actually faster than the standard 000  that doenst make sense    thats what the book says  we dont insure corvettes either  for some reason the underwriters consider supras  and their drivers  as very traditional and conservative   i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons  the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressure guy in the back room  at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance  i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft                 everyones entitled to my opinion                goldbergoasysdtnavymil imagination is more important than

000year  i had not had any accidents before or after this was strictly an age change  that same rate stayed pretty much the same until i sold the car 0 years ago  my f000 pickup is about 00year less   the real amazing thing is that when i woke up at age 00 i felt so much more responsible than i was before     wes    00     for your information california male single under 00  no moving violation

  hello i am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 00 honda civic si  i was wondering if anyone could suggest upgrades that were not too drastic  i thought that one of the easiest upgrades would be a new header  does anyone know what kind of increase that the header would give me  i think i would check with jackson racing for the part  are there any other comparines would make honda parts    are there any other small changes that can be easily made and wont screw up the car  things like new injectors new fuel injection chip etc i would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make a difference  i dont really want to change the cam etc because i have heard that it would be much harder on the engine  email relpies prefered please and i will post a summary of all the replies thanks for any help you may have to offer   jeff smithjsmithcsdalca dalhousie universityhalifax ns

   the biggest hurdle for automatics imho is not shifting speed per se but rather the transmissions reaction speed when you try to force it to shift manually    this was the biggest fault with the subaru ecvt  it took soooooo lonnnnnnnnggggg for the tranny to find the right ratio  the sales propaganda says the saturn automatic is effectively an electronicallyshifted manual  might this mean that saturn has conquered the problem  i dunno only driven saturn 0speeds  input please  another question  any plans for a manualtrans chrysler lh does anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo

    the chevrolet brothers were respected racers  test drivers for the buick co when durant was there  when the directors kicked durant out of gm in 0000 he took chevrolet and others with him  as mentioned before they founded the successful chevrolet company  a littleknown fact is that the chevrolet co actually took over gm that was how durant got back in charge of gm legally his new company chevrolet co did the buying and gm was a division of chevrolet  after 0000 and into the sloan era gm shuffled things so that the gm board was superior but there was always a degree of autonomy given the chevy division presumably because of the initial structure if you look at the organization chart for gm in sloans book chevy division reports directly to 00th floor not through the passenger car division which covers buick olds cadillac and oaklandpontiac  jeff hagen    minor deity of worthless autotrivia  hagenjdacwfuedu

  the idea here is to list pointless options you know stuff you get on a car that has no earthly use   0 power windows  i like my power windows i think theyre worth it  however cruise control is a pretty dumb option whats the point if youre on a long trip you floor the gas and keep your eyes on the rearview mirror for cops right  power seats are pretty dumb too unless youre unlucky enough to have to share your car otherwise youd just adjust it once and just leave it like that    allen tom youre not like the others you like the same  atomsodaberkeleyedu    things i do wax paper boiled football  atomnetcomcom           leather dog breath were not hitchhiking   anymore were riding  ren

   an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy  it switches to sport mode when the electronics figure it  not when the driver sets the switch which is the proper way to do it imo  so what does sport mode entail  several things  0 revving to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy  0 delayed upshifts  ie if you lift off briefly it will remain in the low gear  this is handy if you are charging through corners and would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when theres another curve approaching  0 part throttle downshifts based on the speed at which the pedal is depressed rather than the position of the pedal  modern electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough  also i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick all else being equal remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 0000 in 0th gear of a 0 speed    how many  of people who drive manuals really know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation  im sure there will be some who know but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenarioratio combinations stored in rom is likely to do better  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout high gear low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear high revs and small throttle opening  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it but not that obvious at first sight   eliot

  in recautos you write  if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission it cant be half bad    this mclaren autotransmission i still think its only half auto but you may be right has nothing to do with your gm chrysler volvo or whatever auto transmission its a normal manual transmission gearbox with clutch and all but there are servo motors which do the shifting   that means there is no power loss in the drivetrain if you take out  minimal mechanical friction and the samiauto transmissions  ferrari williams mclaren dont tell you when to shift either however these transmissions share an important disadvantage with your stock autotrannie they are expensive  as long as these servoshifted gearboxes arent available on  normal cars im gonna stick with my manual i just cant see an advantage to make up for two grand i lose in this deal and the loss in mileage and power except maybe in real heavy traffic but then i drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway  theres no point in making a religion out of this i just wanted to point out a few technical facts and my own opinion so theres no need for a flame war  eliot  have a safe ride  chris

  jonghalcyoncom barking weasel writes   schludermannsscvx0sscgov writes   my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever if for some reason i miss the shift window i lightly press the accelerator  try agian ive found that clutchless shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms 00000000 i also skip gears some times using 000 0000          sounds about right  i usually slip it out during throttledown and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right usually about a second and then slip it into gear      so how did you guys learn this is it something you were born with or did you make horrible grinding noises the first few times how many times      i would think youd have to have a certain amount of feel for it to begin with some people would never get it and others like me would never have the guts to try it unless maybe you were planning to buy a new transmission anyway      btw ive heard that quite a few truckers and race car drivers shift this way    zaphodmadnixuucp ron bean uwvaxastroatcnicmadmadnixzaphod

   one thing that everyone is forgetting in this argument over the pricing of the sc0 vs the japanese cars is the saturns nodicker sticker  this makes the saturns price low in comparison to the inflated base prices of the japanese competition on paper but in reality one could dicker several hundred dollars off the price of the japanese cars  admittedly though here in canada at least the sc0  is in the same price class as the civic si not the sc0  steve hui

  wasnt the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver so he could see where he was backing up  although reverse lights on the sides  no reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up they arent bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail lights   are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the path of the car i dont think warnings were their original intents since they are colored white  well red and orange were already taken maybe white defines the direction that the car is moving in   if you really want to be able to see behind you get some fog lamps for the back of the car these work very well  and are a good way to get rid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone  craig      chintan amin the university of illinois urbanachampaign mail llamauiucedu neil peart c0000 quick to judge quick to anger slow to understand ignorance and prejudice andfearwalkhandinhand  
  i deleted your name because i dont want to sound accusative in my remark    this is a twosided problem unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time  the breeding of these lowlifes is getting worse our justice system is at best  extremely weak to handle these problems that is why lowabiding citizens should have  the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary   anywhere a threat is imminent    my camaro my pride and joy got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back  the persons that did that were eventually caught lucky for me but not before  having trashed the car    on another occasion on my way from texas to florida i had stopped in a small motel  for the night in a small town somewhere in florida about 0 youths were disturbing my  car setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out when i and another tenant  walked out with a 000 magnum and a 00 automatic respectively they vanished   needless to say i immediately packedup and left    watch out for carjacking and staged accidents they can be deadly   im not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons but i would ask you if  you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your alarm  i can think of worse things in the world  glad you got out of there before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun  we can all ask whats happening to society these days but dont forget to ask another important question too what effort am i expending to make it any different than it is  just my thoughts joe karolchik

  i know that this isnt the group for it but since you brought it up does anyone have any idea why they havent bombed the waco cult      perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all testified that the batf shot first they they did not identify themselves before tossing in concussion grenades not that anyone inside could have heard such identification after being near a concussion grenade and the announcement from the batf that they have sealed the warrant under which they were operating  which was a search warrant by the way not an arrest warrant  in short perhaps because the batf is wildly out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a compound full of woman and children will not improve their position there is a real chance that koresh will be able to prove selfdefense in court  that will leave  what  four officers dead and no one to blame but the batf  followups directed to altactivism where the discussion has raged nearly as long as the seige and which shows every sign of not giving up nearly as soon  larry smith smithctroncom  no i dont speak for cabletron  need you ask  liberty is not the freedom to do whatever we want it is the freedom to do whatever we are able

  from article 0000apr000000000000virginiaedu by ejv0jvirginiaedu erik velapoldi  this happened about a year ago on the washington dc beltway  snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to  throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass  four or five  cars were hit  there were several serious injuries and sadly  about a year ago some kids tossed a rock off an overpass on i00 near eau claire wisconsin and it killed the driver below  i believe he was a schoolteacher from minnesota  here in houston a couple years ago a young pregnant woman was killed in a similar manner  
   their problem i wasnt giving them any more money the finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time i   reminded him that i was the customer and i didnt think i should be   treated like that and that if he didnt back off he could forget the whole   deal he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick it   snatched back my check and left needless to say they were not pleased by   the turn of events  thats nothing  when a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldnt give her the bimbo treatment her first choice was a mazda 000 and second choice was a nissan sentra  we went to a mazda dealership and described what we wanted  we started negotiating on the price and the salesdroid kept playing the let me run this price by the sales manager  after playing the good salesman bad salesman game we finally told him that if he didnt have the authority to negotiate a price perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did  he brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book  read remar suttons dont get taken every time for a list  finally after playing a few more rounds of youll have to work with us on this price also known as each time you come up a thousand dollars well come down ten the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies stood up and said well we cant come down any more so i guess we cant help you and they trouped out of the room leaving us sitting in the salesmans office all by ourselves  hmm id read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer and i mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door  for lack of anything better to do i picked up the phone on the desk and called another mazda dealership asked for a salesman and began discussing what kind of price they would consider  a few sentences into the conversation mr salesmanager broke into the line  and began telling me how rude he thought it was that i would call another dealership from his phone  i said that since hed announced that our business was over he shouldnt care and every time i tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own  how did he know that i was using the phone anyway  finally i hung up and we headed out of the showroom sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again  we say that we wont bother him anymore were going next door to the nissan dealership  then comes the part i wish i could have videotaped  as we go out the front door the sales manager shouts across the entire showroom customers and all go ahead  you deserve to buy a nissan so my friend bought a sentra  just so the guilty wont go unpunished ill mention that the sales managers name was gary tusone  from his manner his refusal to come down to a reasonable price and his anger at the end my guess is that he had bet our original salesman who was a young novice that hed be able to get at least x dollars out of us and he was steamed that we wouldnt fall for his slimy tricks

   i was worried about someone stealing my oil once also i finally  decided to just have my drain plug welded shut it works great  i figure that when i add three or four quarts when the oil light comes on every month or so that its just as good or better than the old wives tale of changing the oil and filter every 0000 miles works for me i must say    i did the same thing to my drain plug for the same reasons  i was wondering how you filled your crankcase though as i welded my hood shut also out of fear that somebody might steal my airfilter  oh come on silly all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and  put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole  what do you think all those big air intake things are for on those hotrod cars theyre just for looks onlylittle does anyone know they provide access to the oilfill hole  well over where we live we have problems with vandals stealing  peoples wheels  those locking nuts didnt stop them  so to be safe and sure i welded the lug nuts to my wheels together  it works serious  i havent had my wheels stolen yet   
  this just a warning to everybody on the net  watch out for folks standing next to the road or on overpasses   they can cause serious harm to you and your car    just a cliffnotes version of my story follows  00pm last night i was travelling on the interstate here in knoxville  i was taking an offramp exit to another interstate and my wife suddenly screamed and something large hit the side of my truck  we slowed down but after looking back to see the vandals standing there we drove on to the police station  she did get a good look at the guy and saw him cock his arm with something the size of a cinderblock but i never saw him we are  very lucky the truck sits up high on the road if it would have hit her window it would have killed her   the police are looking for the guy but in all likelyhood he is gone  stuff deleted  i am sorry to report that in southern california it was a sick sport for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the freeway  several persons were killed when said blocks came through their windshields  many overpass bridges are now fenced and they have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges as if that would stop such people  yet many bridges are not fenced  i always look up at a bridge while i still have time to take evasive action even though this sport has not reached us here in fresno  greglewiscsufresnoedu photojournalism sequence department of journalism csu fresno fresno ca 00000

   while not exactly a service incident i had a similar experience recently   when i bought a new truck  i had picked out the vehicle i wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price i wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them id be back that evening to pick up the truck   when i returned i had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me when i finally got in there everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers he then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax  license by about 000   this seems to be a popular scam with dealers  last month my brother bought  a new audi 00 series quatro from a local dealer  they came back with the  final price tax and all and he added it up for himself  there happened to  be an extra 000 tagged on under the tax part he pointed out their error  and asked them to rethink their addition  they came back with the right  price the next time

   no reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up they arent bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail lights    craig  perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights are for couldnt we agree that they serve the dual purpose of letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse and that they can also light up the area behind your car while youre backing up so you can see  backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used to be on older cars those on my taurus wagon are quite bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car and theyre  much brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 00s and 00s   insofar as vettes having side backup lights look at a 00 or 00 model or perhaps a year or two earlier too and youll see red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the cars hindquarters  those arent just white reflectors   harv

  i have found a kit advertised for lowering the front end of an early  mustang  installation envolves moving the upper aarm and installation  of a wedge shaped spacer between the aarm and ball joint  apparently  shelby mustangs did a similair modification but left out the spacer  i would be interested in feedback pro or con on such a modification  im no mustang head but dont the early ones have a simple strut suspension that is with no upper aarm  just a strut going down to a lower control arm single bushing not an aarm with a tensioncompression rod locating it in the forwardbackward direction  anyway simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs cutting the springs lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the perch  in each of these cases the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended angle  a spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut roughly the height of the reduction will restore the suspension geometry  imho the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to go  ken   ken r dyean optimist is a guy  lachman technology inc chicagothat has never had   000 0000000 x000much experience  dyelachmancomarchy

  how do i square this with a respectable resale value  easy if its expensive  to buy new its gonna be expensive to buy used  a patently false statement try this logic on an alfa 000 in fact  marketplace has a wonderufl mechanism to adjust the value of the cars that  are overpriced by the manufacturer if it is expensive to buy new it is not  necessarily expnesive to buy used in fact it could be real cheap to buy  used depending what that car is of course note that i do not question your  statements on the reliability of wrangler i have never owned one driven one  or been in one i do love to have one though    what i dont understand is why  this apparent neglect of quality for so many years has not filtered down into  the used marketis jeep so intoxicating so irresistable and so seductive as  to make its purchase a fatal attraction  bijan    yep  they are popular vehicles  you dont see a lot of previous model year ones sitting on dealers lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are out  the things sell they are popular  because they are popular and highpriced new they are high price used very simple  i knew they were overpriced when i bought it i knew they had a terrible  reliability record when i bought it  but i didnt expect anything like i got especially with a dealer network unable to repair it  personal experience has quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine  dave  
  jimfcenterlinecom jim frost writes  there are a few things to keep in mind about europe since you brought it up  my autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but i believe the following to be true  my knowledge about driving in the us is also secondhand but i think i can correct your statements about our autobahn  0 drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are here  oh yeah that would be paradise in fact you can forget it from all ive heard from my us relatives drivers esp here in germany are much more agg ressive but not disciplined one of my relatives a la resident hired a car at the nuernberg airport and went about 00 miles to our home he said then that he grew about 0 year older during this ride and swore hed never drive a car in germany again this was in 0000 and he kept his promise  the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic what you mean by better disciplined should perhaps be considered cautious due to fear  when driving around here you always have to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you they expect that nobody fails or sleeps many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go of course only where that is allowed you might think  dream on  so any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health  and if youre ex posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver you learn to handle it  or you lose  thats the way i and most people i know experience our traffic situation   whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you i think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest compared to the volume and decreasing rates of lethal accidents  otoh more and more people esp women dislike driving because they feel overtaxed and threatened and each accident is one accident too much  0 the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than    they are here and usually include animal fences  this makes them    far more predictable than most us highways  better designed and maintained may be  but animal fences are very rare auto bahnen and many other streets have guardrails i hope thats the right word   a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights its about 0 feet high those guardrails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road smaller animals can crawl under the plank bigger ones can easily jump over it the point is that esp larger animals are very rare in germany they tend also to be very timid accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger  0 not all of europe is the autobahn  most places in europe have    speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in    the us  if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not    much higher than 000kmh  youre right there are speed linits even on the major part of the autobahn  but the attitude towards driving see above seems to be very similar to that in germany ive been in france switzerland italy austria spain belgium the netherlands  besides that you really cant rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits ive got quite a lot of practise 000k miles and im used to travel at 000 mph fyi with a car even smaller than a rabbit but i consider driving on the highways round paris or milano really a thrill  i strongly suspect you wont find a lot of rabbit owners doing 000mph nearly 000kmh on the autobahn but i could be wrong   sorry but youll find quite a lot rabbitclasscar or even smaller mine is a peugeot 000 owners going that fast small cars with much hp are very hip over here  and most people buying such cars arent afraid to let them run                                                          some people have no respect for their own lives  i disagree the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant formula0 cars weigh less than 000 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 000 mph or higher  otoh when crashing against a solid object at 000 mph it makes no difference whether you sit in a porsche a mercedes a tank or on a bicycle yourre dead  bye stefan  stefan dalibor daliborimmd0unierlangende  and now for the next case in kangaroo court i accuse you of being the reincarnation of adolf hitler  i dont think that mere denials will be sufficient  you will have to submit to examinations by a parapsychologist that i personally select perry metzger pmetzgershearsoncom in article 0000 in newsadminpolicy  
  i too was puzzled by this obvious untruth what i think is going on is that nissan claims that the altima is the best selling new car namelplate in the us i think i have this near verbatim lee iaccocas statistics dept would have been proud of that sentence   note that the corollaprism are also new designs but hey are not new  nameplates  i guess nissan doesnt even sell as many altimas as toyota does corollas or there would be no nameplate qualifier

   jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says  can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc  i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i am considering the mx0 probe accord corolla and the 000sx   i bought a 00 probe gt with the pep 000a last july now at 0000 miles after debating over the sentra sernx0000 mx0 mr0 stealth prelude  and celica  the car design is different than earlier years so its too early to see its reliability so far  for what its worth my comments  my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal  some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented  about this problem but i havent seen it happen on my 0 month old  00 probe gt  i think this may be something that ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars  also someone said that ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it  headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke 0000 miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely  havent seen any of these problems nor have i seen these mentioned on the mailing list so these might just be having bad luck with these  crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical  definitely  parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not  stitched properly  hopefully just a fluke  no problems like these either  i havent been able to find any obvious  places where they screwed up  ford only gives 0 key with the car  cmon ford spend an extra few pennies  hmmm  i got two keys with my car  something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this  actually if you count the credit card key that  came in the owners binder i got 0 keys but since the credit card key doesnt have any teeth cut in it yet i guess i wont count it   rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  im waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference  the latter is probably because of the air bag  its pretty much takes up all the space where youd expect to find the horn  speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns  tires fling dirtmud onto side of car   yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes  my likes

00000vr00 goodyear eagles 00 left hoping for 00k   i agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine  the interior is very very nice too  very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound   i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probes suspension doesnt like potholes  when you test drive one find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is  tolerable  yes this cars stiff suspension isnt for everyone  i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car id strongly suggest looking into the mx0  if you have 0 passengers by all means bring them along too  theyll find that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides differently if thats better is up to you    the problem with the back seat is that theres no leg room  plenty of  head room though  shorter people fit back there without any complaints so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to  give them a place to put their feet  also theres a lot of glass around you which i wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer  my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat  the power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car  i really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then ive always been a sucker for open air driving  no leakage problems or anything like thatyet  ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine  i havent heard about this one  i know that some of the very early probes 00 and maybe 00 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which ford will replace at no charge but i havent heard about anything like this concerning the 00 probes  i havent had any real trouble with this car outside of a cv joint boot that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car  i was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering that i was expecting the worst from them  from what ive heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with  the probe and probably mx0 when they first went into production but  i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point  thats almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though  hope this helps  chuck      chuck kesler                       internet   chuckeosncsuedu    unix systems

   is it worthwhile to get an alarm system on a new car    what features are important    what features are unimportant  that is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live  if you live in a place where crime is apparent then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent  however if a professional thief wants your vehicle its as good as gone no matter what you do  but to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options  that would be  0ignition kill or fuel cutoff 0a flashing red led  these two are basic to a decent alarm system   to slow down the criminal some more get a steering wheel lock that should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target but then theres always carjacking   why is life so confusing i hope i helped somewhat   jason yowhuman factors psychology program wright state university dayton ohemail jyowdesirewrightedu   
  it did it again  this morning my 00 ford ranger was idling at 00000 rpm ok so i exaggerated a little but it was idling very fast  it has a 0 liter carburated engine in it and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal i dont think the linkage is stuck what can i do to fix this problem  this has been a problem from time to time but has straightened itself out  until now  i dont have a tach but by gauging by the sound of the engine it is idling about twice as fast as it should be  this is down from what it was idling at when i pulled up at a stop light  many thanks for any suggestions    les    les bartelim going to live forever intergraph corporation or die trying electronics division ljbartelingrcom or ljbartelnaomib00bingrcom 000 0000000

   jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says  can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc  i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i am considering the mx0 probe accord corolla and the 000sx   the probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions but every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value btw the 000sx is rearwheel drive and is due for a redesign for 0000   thanks in advance  while i dont read normally read this group i was looking for valentine radar information sigh maybe in the faq and came across your posting  i bought a 00 probe gt with the pep 000a last july now at 0000 miles after debating over the sentra sernx0000 mx0 mr0 stealth prelude  and celica  check this months consumer reports for previous probe records    my criteria a fun car with abs airbag over 000hp and less than 00k i thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out the tristar cars eclipsetalonetc were out since they dont have an air bag ditto for the mustangalso no abs the sernx0000m00 fell into the pocketrocket category  a good used car buy the mx0 was almost there but rolled more than i liked   i didnt like the prelude dashinstrumentation at all  too weird for me the mr0 has a much smaller nonpassenger space than i needed so out that went the celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat overpriced too in nonturbo form i never considered the 000sx since it didnt have an airbag  i did look at it for its rwd virtues but thats it  the corolla never entered my mind i should have looked at the mitsubishi vr0dodge stealth more since my list was exhausted i bought the probe    the car design is different than earlier years so its too early to see its reliability so far  for what its worth my comments  my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke 0000 miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not  stitched properly  hopefully just a fluke ford only gives 0 key with the car  cmon ford spend an extra few pennies rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  im waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference tires fling dirtmud onto side of car   my likes engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque  definitely 0 handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the 0 speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the 00 sho i drive stability at 000mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather absair bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still tires 00000vr00 goodyear eagles 00 left hoping for 00k   as you can see im primarily interested in the engine  while it doesnt have the uummmph of a bigliter car or the turbo rush the big selling point for me was the allaluminum 00 value 00 liter engine    the overall car is a good buy for the money  that market segment hasnt changed much since july prelude vtec honda del sol  i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probes suspension doesnt like potholes  when you test drive one find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable if you have 0 passengers by all means bring them along too  theyll find that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides differently if thats better is up to you  also theres a lot of glass around you which i wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer  my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat  ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine leather and the keyless entry system werent available when i got the car so i cant comment on them i got the car before it was officially announced   i prefer cloth to leather anyway    i wouldnt want this car in the snow  the suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes tires arent meant for snow and the seats assume that youre not wearing lots of thick clothing  rain is much better  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable and i barely hydroplaned once with the eagles and i was really trying   there is also a definite lack of cup holdersmall storage places  the gt has map holders below the speakers in the door but theyre rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or cds max  the center consolestorage binarm rest has 0 cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch but thats it  no change holders  quite a letdown from the sho and the probe is definitely not a peoplemover car or an econobox car  lastly dont store wet car covers in the back  the foam will soak the  water up and the result will not smell pleasant   nathan nathanscocom    jeremy mereness                  support      ye olde

  anybody got any goodbad experience with selling their car through one of those car hunters  im selling a 0000 dodge stealth rt and i was contacted by this company called the markham group based out of illinois    they said they have 000 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldnt be talking to me  they talked to me for a good 00 minutes asking everything about my car and said they could sell it no problem  they guaranteed that if they didnt sell my car in 00 days i would get my money back 000 and since i charged it im protected by federal law which states that if im not satisfied i would get a refund which is true  they federal expressed all the paperwork  to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 00 days and such  i called up the bbb in illinois and they do not have a file on them which is good news  so they definitely are a legitimate company but so far its been over week and i have gotten nothing  so how effective are these types of  companies anybody care to share their experiences

     i was recently thumbing through the 0000 lemonaid new car guide  what i found was a car would be given a recommended under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed in a front end collision  the most highly recommended small car the civic has the worst crash rating of all of the small cars listed  there were many such cases of great vehicles where you wouldnt survive an accident  is it only me or is safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car    
  hello netters  im visiting the us im from sweden in august i will probably rent a chevy beretta from alamo ive been quoted 000 for a week 00 for additional days this would include free driving distance but not local taxes baltimore  they also told me all insurance thats necessary is included but i doubt that  cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more insurance than whats included in the base price but on the other hand he  didnt rent it from alamo  does anyone have some info on this  is 000 a ripoff  no that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city  probability that ill be needing more insurance unless you have an accident you wont need more  if you plan on paying for the car with a credit card check and see if your card automatically covers rental cars  also your own auto insurance may cover rental cars also  most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent and require you to initial in several spots if you dont want it  the credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell  i have never rented from alamo so i dont know if they follow this same practice  is the beretta a good rental car yes  it is a compact 0door probably a bit dull performance and accelerationwise but very adequate  it will have an automatic transmission amfm stereo air conditioning and possibly power  windows and door locks  joe      joseph staudt telxon corp  joestelxoncom po box 0000                usenet is like tetris for people who still akron oh  000000000         remember how to read 000 0000000 x0000                    j heller  
   in a previous article  eric youngblood says  in article apr0000000000000engrwashingtonedu eliotstalfosengrwashingtonedu eliot writes  race car stuff deleted  back to the f0 stuff for a second note that the auto tranny in f0 still shifts at the drivers command not some preselected schedule  the driver still controls the shifting not the transmission    now there is no dispute that in production cars automatics are  inherently more lossy than manuals  that is in theory  my point all  along is that whatever mechanical advantages a manual has over an  automatic can very easily be lost by a driver who isnt skillful or  one thing that gives an automatic an advantage at launch is the fact that it has a torque converter vs a clutch  i know this sounds strange but a torque converter multiplies the engine output when launching  it functions             as a sort of limited continuously variable transmission typically you get  a torque multiplication of 0 to 0 times depending on the stall speed  i have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile  such systems do exist but none are presently installed in production autos that i am aware of  these are commonly called viscous drive cvts or fluidic amplifiers   contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered result is no tq mult  what the convertor does allow is for the engine to be closer to its torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage its driveline  chevy proved it many years ago with the 00 camaro ets and terminal 00 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 0 speed and auto cars  note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can get away with fewer gears than a manual the slip in the convertor makes up for the fewer ratios and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed 0 sspeed autos soon to be out note that some manufacturers are using 0 speed manulas now   once past lauch however the converter begins coupling and the tq multiplication effect is reduced but by then you should be on the cam  correct   al bowers  dod 000  alfa  ducati  hobie  kottke  blad  iaido  nasa well goodness sakesdont you know that girls cant play guitar                                              mary chapincarpenter

   my bbb autoline arbitration experience is over   the outcome was decidedly mixed  i won the battle but  lost the war  the arbitrator found that the car was  defective but decided to offer a repurchase well below  market value   at the time of the hearing average  retail on my truck in the nada book was 00000 but  the decision was for  00000  i wrote a letter to the  council of better business bureaus pointing out the  fact that if you have an automobile that does not  depreciate rapidly the manufacturer has no incentive  to deal with you  there is no way that the  manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and  sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded  a repurchase  the attitude of chevrolets  representative at the hearing tends to support this  point of view  he was totally unprepared and did not  seem to take the proceeding very seriously  i decided to take the repurchase even though i am  getting totally screwed on the price  i will not have  to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon  myself and i have no case for a civil suit based on  the idaho lemon law  i am planning to send a letter to  my elected representatives telling them how utterly  ridiculous the idaho lemon law is  the law allows for  a use deduction equal to the irs mileage allowance   as if chevrolet were buying my gas and paying  for my insurance  summary of the case  in may 0000 i bought a new 00 ton hd chevrolet pickup  between may 0000 and december 0000  this vehicle required repair after repair  systems  that required attention included the transmission  heater fan paint suspension and motor  the main  problem was the five speed manual transmission  they  could not install a nondefective transmission in at  least four attempts  so in summary it is possible to get a repurchase but  you are going to get screwed on the price unless you  paid too much in the first place or if your car  happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly  jackwhpdmd00boihpcom

   i am currently in the car market and would like opinions on a vw passat glx  how does it compare to a toyota camry  i thought the car looked very solid stable and european  only disappointment so far is that that it doesnt offer an airbao my next question is why isnt vw offering automobiles with airbags  should i pay the extra three thousand for a bmw 000 is even though it is smaller and less powerful than than the passat  i think vw got caught out on the airbag thing  its only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature vw assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt requirements for passive restraint but didnt guess that the merican consumer would actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag  vw is really hurting right now in the us market  check out the article in last weeks autoweek about the crisis at vw  golfs and jettas will be coming from the plant in mexico but they dont have the quality at that facility  as per normal vw practice the us launch of the jetta iii is delayed again and again until a good chunk of the useful life of the design is spent  i think that passats come from germany so there is not the same quality and availability issue  its a nice car with a nice engine whether vw will be a player in the us market in two years time is a different question  ill leave the passat  camry flamewar for someone else

   i just read articals on this in road and track and car and driver  is that one mag or two b and i was wondering if people out  there have any opinions that differed from what these mags have to say  depending on how you plan to use your suv i might recommend also browsing trailer boats and one or more of those pickup shotgun and 0wd magazines  the car rags mostly seem to consider recently graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips to be a bedload  considering that most of these suvs seem to be  used mostly as robust station wagons thats probably not a bad approach but if your applications are more demanding pick your information sources accordingly  of the three vehicles on your short list explorer 0runner  pathfinder id recommend the 0runner as being closely based  on a rather robust pickup and the explorer for being comfortably  carlike  dont know much about the pathfinder  good luck joe just another personal opinion from the peoples republic of berkeley

  i have a 00 chevy sprint with ac and 0doors its odometer turned 00k and the sensor light started blinking i went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying i need to change the oxygen sensor he said it is to be changed every 00k but since i bought the car when it had 00k i dont know if the same thing happened at 00k and 00k  he quoted 000 for the part and 00 to install it the part cost 00 outside but the mechanic i went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts he suggested i wait till it malfunctions before i do anything  if anyone out there owns a chevy sprint i want to know how they got their oxygen sensors changed also did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealers help also what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction    any help would be greatly apprecisted    thanks        nagesh i have owned my sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every 00k to let you know its time for a check up  when that light goes on i just take it to the delaer tell them its that time and they work on it for 0 hou and you pay 0 for parts and 000 for labor ahhwhat they get for labor i currently have about 00k on my sprint and of all the times i took it in for service i never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the oxygen sensor  what the heck is an oxygen sensor  as far an i know of i have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten now i dont have ac mother nature does that for me   and that might have something to do with it but i still never heard of an oxygen sensor  the only major service job i have had on my car besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job was getting the rotor distributor and gasket replaced  and that was all done within the past 0 months    what i do at 00k is have a good tuneup let them replace what ever they need to pay the bill about 000 and go home and dont worry about the car for another 00k  oh i just remembered something  if that little sensor light bothers you in the fuse box right below the turnsignal lever up against the dash there is a swith on the right side  flip that switch and the light will go off  i do that so that little light wont annoy me  if you cant find it look it up in the car manuel  i hope that i have helped a little and good luck with the oxygen sensor   thomas      email address     give me an an army of west point       tjz0000zeustamuedu     graduates and ill win a battle           give me a handful of texas aggies        creator of mot power     and ill win a war                         gen george s patton                 
     i was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage  what kind of memory is stablereliable enough nonvolatile enough and independent enough of outside battery power to last say 00 years or more in the life of a vehicle  im amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for this length of time especially in light of all the gizmos i work with that are doing good to work for 0 months without breaking down somehow  mk00t00 from thomsom  it has a timekeeper clock and 000 bytes of nvram which has a lithium battery backup  the battery has a life of 00 years of poweroff operation  installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not draw much current  the battery would only be used when your auto battery was dead or had been removed  side question  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles after say 000000000k actual miles  looks like fraud would be fairly easy  for the price of a new odometer you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has  in california they have a line on the transfer of ownership form which states that the odometer mileage is correct  if incorrect you are required to  fill in what you know or guesstimate to be the correct mileage  if you lie on this form and are caught you can be prosecuted and the buyer can sue you for the value of the mileage differential   faster horses younger women older whiskey more money  
  les bartels comments sorry i cant help you with your question but i do have a comment to make concerning aftermarket ac units  i have a frostking or frosttemp forget which aftermarket unit on my cavalier and am quite unhappy with it  the fan is noisy and doesnt put out much air  i will never have an aftermarket ac installed in any of my vehicles again  i just cant trust the quality and performance after this experience   les  let me add my 00 in i had a ac installed by the ford garage and it did not work as well as the ac that was installed by the factory in pickups  identical to mine i have talked to other people that have had the same result dont know if this is just a probable with ford or what  ernie smith  i agree never have the dealer add anything to your car  if you want ac make sure it is factory installedhondas maybe excluded many cant be  bought with ac installed at the factory but i think maybe they actually use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one inas in bigger radiator etcor are designed properly for this in the 0st place anyway my point is the dealer installed ac wont be anywhere near as good as factory and the service bums will mess up your car when installing it scratches screwdriver holes in seatsparts not reinstalled correctly or  with all the screws etc  i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm dealer for 00 yearshe said never have a dealer add anything to your car except maybe floormats

  i just started reading this thread today so forgive me if it has already been mentioned  butwhat was the deal with renaults putting the horn on the lefthand turnsignal stalk  it was a button on the end where the washer button would be on the wiperwasher stalk  could the frenchies not figure out the wiring through the steering wheel or what  had an 00 alliance for a long time  it was a comfortable but sluggish car  i got very used to the horn on the stalk after a couple months worth of getting used to it  after i bought my next car a chevy it took me forever to get used to the horn on the steering wheel again  jim grey jwgacd0acdcom  up the irons

   well i guess i know for sure what i meant and it is this  i dont know where you drive but around here freeways are often clogged solid with large packs of semis trucks and cars of all descriptions  when i close on one of these rolling clusterfs on the highway i have no desire to add my vehicle to this rolling accident looking for a place to happen if there were any way to pass it i would be passing myself however i cant      as i posted before all it takes is a blown tire or some moron tramping on the brakes to turn this pack  into a cloud of shredded metal flying glass and burning vehicles   i want to maintain enough free space between myself and this mess to at least have a minimal chance to avoid a mass crash that means maintaining a clear space  between me and it however there is no end of shortdriving morons who are dying to pass so they can add themselves and their car to the bodycount  that wouldnt bother me so much except that after letting enough of these morons pass me and glue themselves to the pack ahead my interval is filled up trying to back off further does not  work because the road behind me has filled up trapping my car right into an ever increasing pack  now if there was any slight possibility that there was a lane open ahead id be glad to move over but there usually is no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere so i block the wouldbe passers not only for my own good  but theirs as well even though they are often too stupid to realize it   just an comment  i dont like it when people decide whats good for me if you think youre going to decide anything for me youd better be  carrying a badge and a gun  who made you capable of determining if there is no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere  why do you find  it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own  business  if someone is minding their own business i will give them all the room they want and ill try to make things easy for them even letting them in in front of me if they ask politely with a directional on the other hand if someone like you decides they want to block me and be a general asshole you can bet your ass that ill make life as  miserable as possible for you as long as it doesnt affect anyone else whos minding their own business   they have a phrase to describe someone like you self appointed traffic police just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong  as a rule of philosophy i dont feel particularly sorry when somebody gets  offed by his own stupidity but it does worry me when some idiot is in a position to cash in my chips too                                                             hh mayo                                                 00 mustang gt                        bob pitas           ush              0000  000                      bpitactpcom                          up at ned epping nh           cambridge ma                               geddy lee in yyz disclaimer these opinions are mine obviously since they end with my sig

  are there any mr0 owners or motorhead gurus out there that know why my mr0s engine sounds noisy the mr0s engine is noisy at the best of times  but not even a nice nose  its one of those very ugly noises   assuming yours is a non turbo mr0 the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline 0 that doesnt have balance shafts  i guess toyota didnt care about little details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling  myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or recommendation which has an inline 0 larger than 0 liters and no balance shafts  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you ever want a halfway decent engine    if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do except to sell it and get a v0   eliot

  im about to buy a new car and finance some of it  since i paid cash for the last car i bought i did not have to worry about whether or not i had a good amount of insurance on it because of a bank loan  i just put the amount that i wanted not what a bank would have wanted  friends are telling me that banks require some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since it is collateral on loans  is this true  can that insurance be gotten as part of my other insurance  i assume i dont have to pay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance am i correct  i hear about accidenthealth type insurance at the dealers and i am pretty sure these are just money makers for them  i just want to verify that i dont have to buy these at all  or any other types of extras  what do i have to pay for  car tax license  anything else  ellen   
  boylecactusorg  writes  in article 0qv0mndqlmenudouhedu thangharebellegruhedu chinheng  thang writes  recently i saw an ad for the altima which says that it is the    best seller for the past 0 months is that true       i too was puzzled by this obvious untruth what i think is going on is that  nissan claims that the altima is the best selling new car namelplate in  the us i think i have this near verbatim lee iaccocas statistics  dept would have been proud of that sentence what they mean i think is  that of all totally new models ie cars never sold before in any  form the altima is the best seller thereby eliminating accord taurus  etc   this is from the same people who make the claim that our minivan is outsellin theirs implying that the nissan quest murcury villager are outselling the chrysler minivans not only is this not true at all but it was a stupid claim to make the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the  vans  kind of a bold statement to make when you havent even sold one yet eh   and i thought buick and oldsmobile where bad  shame on you nissan and  mercury    any other interpretations      craig   does anyone has anyhting regarding the  of cars sold for the    past 0 months        tony

   i heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than  gas engines because the emit less of carbon monoxide  hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen  co hc nox    but they can put out a lot of particulate matter  i heard  something about legislation being discussed to clean up  diesel emissions  is there anything in the works to  install scrubbers for diesels  how about the feasibility  of installing them on trucks and cars  would it be any  different than a catylitic converter  id assume easier  since were removing particulate matter instead of converting  gasses  lets hear peoples opinions          vel natarajan  natarajartsgmotcom  motorola cellular arlington hts il      this really bugs me  the emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars in california  what a bunch of crap  diesel is the fuel of choice for  enviromental benefit in europe while here its illegal for the same reason  the particulates are nothing but carbon  they are just an annoyance at worst nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions torque or engine durability  its also cheaper   horace dediu                                                  gte laboratories 000 0000000                                                00 sylvan road internet hdediugtecom                                      waltham ma 00000

   eliot is right about 00 liter engine in the second and last generation mr0s but the original guy did not indicate the year of his mr0 if its a first generation car like my 00 it has 00 liter engine or perhaps same engine with a supercharger if its 00 00 the sound he describes is common to any older toyota engine i ever heard i dont know the relevance of his observations about oil changes my simply makes noise not all that annoying mind you but you hear it well when the engine is right behind your left ear  mikes  sorry bout that  mine is a 00 model nonturbo 00 with abs and revised suspension whatever revised means im in australia so we always seem to  get the versions without extras which the europeans and americans get as  standard  my query is  why does the noise get noticeably louder about 00 months after an oil change i just find it a bit wierd that this happens is it the oil im using mobil 0 or is it the engine the 0sge versionmodel ie gets noiser the older the oil is im only guessing   its not annoyingly distressing or anything but just slightly puzzling   puzzled

   this isnt anything new  back in 0000 i was driving under a high overpass at night on i000 in san diego when i caught a glimpse of someone on the overpass  as i passed under a rock slammed against the metal between the winshield and right front window  my girlfriend was in the seat next to it  i called the police from the next exit but i doubt if they were found  about five years ago in san diego someone was put into a coma from a brick being thrown through his sunroof as he was driving and subsequently crashed  i dont think he ever came out of the coma and i havent heard anything about it for a couple years  i know that this isnt the group for it but since you brought it up does anyone have any idea why they havent bombed the waco cult      probably because there are many children there  also the minor fact that other than defending themselves from 000 some people attacking them they havent threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in years  being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds for a mass murder of koresh and his followers  sorry for posting this to this group but i thought the previous post needed a rebuttal  if you followup to this portion please crosspost and direct followups to a more appropriate newsgroup     boyd johnson   noscspectracomjohnson  san diego california  intermittent newsfeed at best and only to selected groups my opinions certainly dont match those of my employer

   ive a 00 mazda 000 with about 00000 miles on it  recently i do not get  a good feeling of the road esp on a wet pavement when driving the car  it feels as if the car is wandering and there is no grip on the road  the tires are the original ones and have threads on them passes the  penny head test  i had the shocks and struts and alignment checked and  things are fine  however i feel like that i dont have the grip of the  road and feel as if the car is wandering esp on turns  any help  in this is appreciated  thanks    two shots at it 0 check the tires again  if you can see the wear bars youre down to problem area and some tires pass a penny test between the bars  thats no guide at all your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning you may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire  so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road  0 tires age in particular soft tire compounds get harder as you put them thru more heat cycles harder compounds dont grip as well as soft ones effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very often such as in competition but it hits all tires  bob benson

  if im not mistaken altering the odometer is illegal  furthermore i surmise itll be tough to alter bmws odometer if you got at it some of the newer bmws have electronic odometers making it even more tamperproof  on the cars mentioned  0 series from the late 00s the electronic odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer that is driven by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle  these pulses are  converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer  and speedometer no way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage reading  it also means the odometer is just as easy or hard to change as any other mechanical odometer  on the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor and run the car with no speedometer or odometer readinga simple switch will do the job  it also will disable the speed limiter which will enable the car to reach its full speed       alan l peterman                                 0000000000 hm  work                        alqiclabscnraincom its odd how as i get older the days are longer but the years are shorter

  joni ciarletta writes  my honda accord just hit the magic 000000 mile mark and now  all sorts of things are beginning to go bad the latest problem  i am experiencing is with my brakes  they still stop the  car fine but once i am stopped completely my brake pedal  will sink another 0 or 0 inches all by itself  if feels really  strange and i am worried my brakes will quit working one of  these days    i checked my brake fluid and the reservoir was full but the  fluid itself looked really dirty like dirty oil  i called  my mechanic and he told me i need a new brake master cylinder  which will cost me a whopping 000000  you are not alone  my 00 honda accord with 000000 miles on it started   showing the same behavior  i replaced the brake master cylinder myself  it took about an hour and cost   about 00  sure beats paying 000 to have someone else do it  if i wanted to   rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one it would   have cost only 00 to 00 for the rebuild kit  the honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to  two bolts attach it to the   engine compartment  two brake lines enter the master cylinder  the tricky   part was that the brake lines were stuck tight  my craftsmen open end wrench   rounded off the bolt heads  i had to use vise grips to loosen those suckers    wow  best invention since sliced bread  after that it was very easy  bolt   the new part in place add new brake fluid and bleed the brakes  this is quite easy even for a beginner  my local auto parts store had a repair   manual for the honda accord it had detailed diagrams of the master brake   cylinder and a stepbystep procedure for replacing it

  ive had a valentine for about 0 months now and i agree that it is the best det ector available the point here is trust and reliability ive been able to tr ust the valentine more than any other detector ive owend if the valentine sa ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me then its mo re than likely to be a speed trap with my other detectors ive gotten so many  falses that ive begun to ignore someo of the warnings because i didnt want t o drive like i had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal  that directional indicator really really helps plus more info is almost alwa ys better than less info no matter how smart radar detectors get the human br ain is usually smarter so if im going to make a decisio based on information  at hand i want all the info i can get plus if you divide the overall streng th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported youll find that each bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat with other detectors yo ull just get one strong warning my logic may be faulty on this but i think i t works okay  although i must admit that i havent really noticed the reflection problem of one radar souce  thomas  
  i agree with gaia even though the saturn has proved to be a very reliable car so far a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind  in my opinion getting the powertrain warranty is enough in my case thats be cause anything that needed repairing in the interior sunroof windows doors  etc i could do myself i just didnt want to mess with the engine and such  plus i think the extra 0 years of 00hour roadside assistance must be worthe so meting i opted for the 0 year plan for 000  thomas

  if you put a locking lugnut on your tires do you need to have your tires rebalanced  john mas   email address          masskclamonsantocom   well it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have  my previous car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 00oz more than the others  the locking lugnuts were factory equipment and according to the factory service manual after tire balancing the technicianmechanic was supposed to put a 00 oz counterweight on the rim opposite the locking nut  i always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no one ever did the service correctly i eventually got rid of the locking lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts  unfortunately i found out about the counterweighting technique 0 months after i got rid of the locking nuts   my present car a saturn sc has locking lugnuts that i bought at the dealer and are made specifically for the saturn  they have been made to be exactly the same weight as the nonlocking lugnuts said so on the package and i verified it myself  i havent had any vibration problems with the tires at all due to the nuts in 00000 of ownership  i did have some other vibration problems but it was due to a poor job of tire balancing  tom

   im not familiar with the trannies used in winston cup but in the transam  cars ive played with the  transmissions were the racing variety with  dog clutches instead of sychros  in a transmission with dog clutches the  gears are always  engaged with each other and moving the dog clutches  engages the gears to the shafts  motorcycle transmissions are the same way  shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause  transmission damage the only question being how long it  takesto grenade  something for the trans in my 00  pulsar se it was  about 00k miles but  it had a weak  tranny in the first place    just out of curiosity how is this dog clutch any different from a synchro  transmission  what you described sounds the same to me  in fact what little  ive studied on trannies the instructor referred to the synchros as dogs  and said they were synonymous  the gears are always meshed in a synchronized  gearbox and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting or at least  that is what i was taught  explain por favour  motorcycle transmissions dont have synchros  the engagment dogs are very corse and sloppy  there are maybe 000 teeth dogs on the side of the gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back and forth  to shift  start to apply pressure at the same time the clutch is pulled the clutch is a hand lever and shift quickly  if  you try a slow lazy shift it will grind you just have to pop it into the next gear before it has a chance to grind  there isnt a neutral between gears obviously there is but you cant select it with the shifter so double clutching is not a possibility  speed shifting which is what i have always heard clutchless shifting called works pretty well for upshifts with some practice but i usually use the clutchespecially for the lower gears  i think auto as in automobile trannys are similar except that the engagment dogs are very fine with no slop  and the addition of syncho rings  the gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions that are synchronized but may not be in nonsynchro gears reverse and sometimes first     frank ball   0urm          frankbsadhpcom    000 0000000 work hewlett packard             000 0000000 fax  000 0000000 home 0000 valley house drive     it000 xt000 seca 000 00 f000 pl000 rohnert park ca 000000000  kc0wug law ama dod 0000 im the nra

     i find this method much better myself too although i do really  hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my  hand both come crashing into my face  after coming to which is  about 00 minutes later i change my clothes because by this time  all the oil has drained on me and ice my entire face and suck  down about 00 tylenol to ease the pain  later in the day i then  proceed with refilling the engine oil    its just crazy how i try and change the oil on my cars in one  weekendi go through about 0 bottles of tylenol and 0 bags of ice  oh thats not so bad every time i try to change the oil i forget to shut off the engine first the hot oil comes out and scalds me blinds me then the engine starts to overheat and while im screaming in agony and trying to crawl out from under the car i grab the red hot exhaust pipe and get third degree burns on my hands my screams intensify as i finally emerge from under the car and i struggle to my feet in front of the car whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super heated coolant then the engine seizes but not before the cylinder head explodes piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron  this happens every time im starting to think i should pay the mechanic 00 instead paying the hospital 000000 and the dealer 00000 for a new car this gets costly when you change the oil every 0000 miles   toadface

  i agree with gaia even though the saturn has proved to be a very reliable car so far a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind  this is an interesting point  some people are not really buying the coverage they are buying peace of mind marketing folks love selling that  i suggest that people choose to not engage their minds in peaceless worry rather than buying that peace of mind  in my opinion getting the powertrain warranty is enough in my case thats be cause anything that needed repairing in the interior sunroof windows doors  etc i could do myself i just didnt want to mess with the engine and such  youd be surprised how much the little knickknack stuff can cost  what if  your ac goes out  steering rack  dont get me wrongim against all extended warrantiesthey are a ripoff  plus i think the extra 0 years of 00hour roadside assistance must be worthe so meting i opted for the 0 year plan for 000 extra 0 yrs  you realize the first 0yr00k is free warranty that comes with  the car  thomas

  troysequentcom troy wecker writes there is no question that the valentine0 000 has good range but not significant enough to be 0 or 0 times as expensive as some of the others  the big win with the v0 is not its range but rather its directionality and multipletransmitter tracking which you later called a gimmick  a conclusion i disagree with  since the detector incorporates multiple receivers its not surprising that its significantly more expensive  while the added capabilities may not help you there is added value for those of us who live in areas where there are a lot of falsealarms  summary valentine0 way too expensive and not a significantly better performer  i certainly call it interesting but im another person who thinks that the added value might be coming at too high a cost  very adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and one of them has suited me rather well  if i did more longdistance travelling in areas im not familiar with id probably consider getting the v0 because its additional information would be useful in discriminating false alarms  jim frost jimfcenterlinecom

  hi i need your help with a problem i have with a 0000 mitsubishi galant gs transmission  the car has a 0 speed manual tranmission since the car was bought new while shifting from 0nd to 0rd  unless  i do it slowly and carefully it makes a popping or hitting sound the dealer and mitsubishi customer service reached by an 000  say  this is normal for the car  is it and about a year ago at 00kmiles the stick shift handle got stuck while attempting to put it in reverse    0 the shifter would not budge  the clutch had no effect    0 the front tires would not budge even when the clutch is       fully depressed    0 if the clutch is released the engine would die    0 assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was       stuck i could not make the car move  it acted as if       it were in neutralexcept for dying when clutch is released    0 i finally was able to release the shifter by having        someone rock the car back and forth less than an inch       while i depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter    0 the shifter acted normally after that  when this happened i took it to the dealer they checked the  clutch it was ok they checked the transmission it was ok  i had the exact problem a couple of months ago and again last week  the dealer says there is nothing they can do because  mitsubishi the 000  says they have never heard of the problem and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car   in all three occurances the car was parked head first in a garage and since the front wheels were stuck the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter hence temporarily solving the problem  and the dealer and mitsubishi refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck  i know there is smething wrong with the transmission shifting  from 0nd to 0rd and getting stuck at random but i cant get  the dealer to fix it i need your help with the mechanical problems  and with how to handle mitsubishi   all hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated and sorry to bore you with the long post  thanks rabih   try another dealer  sometimes the sophistication of equipment etc is better at one dealer than another  you may also find another dealer willing to help you with the problem   joe  
  but why not turn the question around why are automatics so common in the us  because some people like them and some people actually need them  my guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torquerich v0s in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to  use both feet to depress and that this has just lived on  yeah right real muscle cars had a manual transmission and their clutches arent that heavy shelbyamerican used plenty of highpowered hightorque engines and carroll only put autos in his cars because people wanted them blasphemers heretics burn them burn them for defiling a shelby with an auto  real cobras and they were the ultimate sports car at the time had bigblock fords which turned out prodigious amounts of power and torque and none of them had automatics   and also an automatic with a v0 engine can be real fun to drive  yeah if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve fun   i personally would love to have a 00 galaxie 000 0liter coupe with a firebreathing 000 and fouronnafloor to go along side my 00 galaxie 000 pillarless hardtop with a firebreathing 000 with threeonnatree i love the sound of dual exhaust in the morning  theres no comparison between a real american muscle car and a car with a big engine and an automatic imho   james  james p callison    microcomputer coordinator u of oklahoma law center  callisonuokmaxecnuoknoredu       callisonaardvarkucsuoknoredu    disclaimer im not an engineer but i play one at work the forecast calls for thunder00 tbird sc    its a hell of a thing killing a man you take away all he has  and all hes ever gonna have  will munny unforgiven

  for a reasonable sum you can get a bmw with traction control a torquesensing limited slip rear differential    traction control as far as the optional feature that one buys with cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential  a torque sensing differential is a type of lsd but not all lsds are torque sensing  viscous coupled differentials as opposed to viscous couplings are rotational sensing not torque sensing for that matter so are traction control systems that use abs sensors and pulse braking  then there are the older positracs and whatever which i am not familiar with the workings   eliot

  i just ordered a saturn sl0 after considering a few imports frankly the saturn  stuff deleted  saturn also has a good extended warranty program 000 for 0 year00k miles  fully refunded if you dont use it that works out to an actual cost of 000 or so based on the 0 year treasury rates using savings account rates its more like 000 in the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work without counting against the refund mike  in general extended warranties are a ripoff  this 0yr00k is really only 0yr00k because you get the 0yr00k one free with the car  also is there perhaps a deductible you pay each and every time you use the warranty also are certain items excluded from coverage on the extended warranty and if you use it at year 0 for some 00 buck job and pay a 00 deduct and then you have used it so no refund ever again extended warranties are ripoff high profit items for the dealer

  yes i saw a 000 turbo quattro wagon on i000 in nj on monday  i thought audi stopped selling wagons in the us after the 0000  this is exactly the type of vehicle i would like to own  i bet its price is 00 times my car budget  think again  thanks to 00 minutes tick tick tick used 000 quattros are bargains 00s go for about 00k 00s go for perhaps 0 or 0k more the 00 valve 00s are quite a bit more because of an enormous hp and torque gain i think they go for about 00 to 00k if you can find one  i have seen quite a lot of 0000 000 quattros not that many wagons though at the dealer lot they use very high quality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized so it will never rust  in short typically a 0 yr old 000 looks no more older than a 0 year old and the 0 bangers are bullet proof engines  000k out of one is not rare even for a turbo which is watercooled for the 000s  then there are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost  if you are into luxogizmos the cars are loaded with just about everything too  the price of parts is a different story though   eliot  
  here is a story  i bought a car about two weeks ago  i finally can get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence history of the car  in between 00 and 00 the instrument pannel  of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero  therefore the true meter reading is the reading before replacement plus current mileage  that shows 00000 mile difference comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from  the  dealer never told me anything about that important story  i hope that i can return the car with full refund  do u think this is possible  does anyone have similar experiences  any comments will be appreciated  thanks  this is a tricky situation if the previous owner didnt inform the dealer of the odometer change then the previous owner committed fraud and he may be liable the dealer may also be liable if the previous owner notified the dealer or if the previous owner had the  dash replaced at a dealer or if the previous owner had the dash changed  legally any records search on the car should turn up the fact that the odometer had been altered  if a dealer changes the speedometer he has to report it it goes into the cars service record with the manufacturer and on the title if i remember correctly the dealer told me that the old mileage etc were sent to ford when my tbirds speedo  was replaced if the odometer can be set to the old mileage it must  be if it cant eg electricallydriven odometers then the mileage  of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is  affixed to the door frame of the vehicle   either way if the change had been done legally then a records search which the dealer almost certainly did should have turned it up  call your states department of transportationpublic safetymotor vehiclesor your tag agentto find out for certain what your rights are your states attorney general will know for certain   james  james p callison    microcomputer coordinator u of oklahoma law center  callisonuokmaxecnuoknoredu       callisonaardvarkucsuoknoredu    disclaimer im not an engineer but i play one at work the forecast calls for thunder00 tbird sc    its a hell of a thing killing a man you take away all he has  and all hes ever gonna have  will munny unforgiven

  ljbartelnaomib00bingrcom les bartel writes  it did it again  this morning my 00 ford ranger was idling at 00000 rpm ok so i exaggerated a little but it was idling very fast  it has a 0 liter carburated engine in it and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal i dont think the linkage is stuck what can i do to fix this problem  this has been a problem from time to time but has straightened itself out  until now  i dont have a tach but by gauging by the sound of the engine it is idling about twice as fast as it should be  this is down from what it was idling at when i pulled up at a stop light  sometimes a bad choke pulloff diaphram will cause a car to fast idle the pulloff which is vacuum actuated provides a necessary pull in noncold weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam locate the fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a normal idle if so locate the diaphram and test it if you cant apply suction via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose with your mouth that will cause the diaphram to retract then its bad and should be replaced  bernie lofaso applied research labs

   does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a bmw after changing the oil yourself  also i have about 0000 miles on my 000i and so far only one of the five yellow service indicators went out that means i dont need oil service until it reach approximatly 00000 miles which doesnt make sense to me any idea  ps of cause i did my first oil change at 0000 miles    derek

  they light the highways in texas  funny everywhere else ive been they only light em at junctions  and armadillo crossings  texas is pretty much an edgecase  you cant assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such wideopen spaces  it just aint so  well lets see in just my own personal experience theres nevada new mexico texas wyoming utah south dakota nebraska  minnesota montana florida and parts of louisianna  nobody said lets go into town and drive 000 on main st and you couldnt go that fast on the graveled washboard that passes for highway in some parts  but that only really expensive cars should be driven fast crap is well crap  wr    
   remember roads in america are not designed for speeds above 00 meaning they would be safe at 0000 roads like the autobahn are smoother straiter wider and slightly banked   example a few months back i was traveling late at  night  000 am or so and i was changing highways at a bent crosssing it  curved off to the south east becoming hidden by trees after about 0000 ft and continued to the left strait north i wanted to turn north checked the south lane rolled into the crossing and checked the north lane nevertheless there wasnt  a car in sight so i took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane now my car isnt a 0 sec 000 performer but i was in the corect lane and  over 00 in decent time even at 000 i wasnt wasting time it was then that i checked my mirror and saw a mustang closing in my lane fast he  had just turned the corner and was just noticing me luckly he saw me and  changed lanes in time i estamate he was moving in excess of 00 or so i was just a by stander i had no chance of runing from him or moving out  of his way im glad he saw my brake lights in time i shudder to  think of what would have happened had i wainted to pull out and not  left the time he needed to dodge me  rule just because your car can do 000 and  your way is clear dont assume it will stay that way               travis disclamer the ideas expressed above are in fact the same as                          my employer since i have none             email flame at  marshattfeserveccpurdueedu         
   hello   i have a 00 toyota 0x0 and in the last few weeks i have been getting quite a few dings  in the paint on the hood from rocks and debris off of the road i have never had any major problems with other cartrucks in the past maybe a ding once in a while i went to the dealer and he said that it happens all of the time and he recomended putting a bug deflector on the hood he said that the trucks for some unknown reason seem to have this problem more than some cars   it seems to me that either my luck is really bad or there might be a problem with the paint painted on a monday morning perhaps    how well do these bug deflectors work for small road debris on trucks    if anyone has any experiencessuggestions please let me know thanks   greg    thornwamumdedu  
  im wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter ive been doing it my self over 000000 miles on my current toyota truck ive got over 000k ive heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission my experiences suggest otherwise what techniques do you use  on some old pieces of junk i drove the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift except clutchless to date ive driven rabbits datsuns comets fords  a chevy some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker  easier they where to shift  my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever if for some reason i miss the shift window i lightly press the accelerator  try agian ive found that clutchless shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms 00000000 i also skip gears some times using 000 0000   krispy

  im having an interesting problem with my girlfriends car  before i delve into its innards i thought id check netwisdom on the subject   its a 0000 buick skyhawk i knowi know 00l efi 0banger auto 00k miles  when i drive tha car long enough to get it hot especially at highways speeds the transmission has this nasty habit of getting stuck in 0rd gear  as a result when you stop for a light the motor stalls  putting the car in park and waiting for 0000 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to reset and go back into 0st  otherwise it just stalls when put in drive    my thoughts  either it the 0rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot not so likely or perhaps the lockup converter is not disengaging properly seems likely  the least likely keeping fingers crossed is that some critical vacuum hose has brokencracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere as used to happen with old modulator valves  my background is that my father owns a service station and i worked there on and off from 0000 years of age  please feel free to be as technical as you want   id appreciate hearing any tipssuggestionsoffers of free beer grin  skoal  chris

   better still years ago they demonstrated a cold air system which only used air it was called a rovax the unit worked very well the short coming was the seal technology where is it today  actually the company and the product was rovac  which stood for rotary air conditioningit used a rotary compressor with what was effectively an airair heat exchanger and worked pretty well the negatives were mostly that it was about 000 less efficient than using freon and noise problems from the high velocitypressure air all of which were solved by the time the company went bankrupt  it is still a legal entity in florida but i believe completely dead and theres a heck of an opurtunity to buy up its patents and restart the operation     alan l peterman                                 0000000000 hm  work                        alqiclabscnraincom its odd how as i get older the days are longer but the years are shorter

    but they can put out a lot of particulate matter  i heard something about legislation being discussed to clean up diesel emissions  is there anything in the works to install scrubbers for diesels  how about the feasibility of installing them on trucks and cars  would it be any different than a catylitic converter  id assume easier since were removing particulate matter instead of converting gasses  lets hear peoples opinions  the technology cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer ca emissions laws involves three things i know of  0 all compliant diesels are turbocharged 0 all use an aftercooler which cools the air which was heated    by compression by the turbocharger up to about 00 psi 0 a gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air    intake and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is    low  no scrubbers catalytic converters etc are used  the path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free  interestingly except for the lowpressure fuel limitation power output  and mileage are enhanced by these measures  one can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power lots more power and these are approved by the carb  dan hepner

     hi   ive been seeing all these articles about changing  brake fluid and i am wondering if this is really necessary  i have an 00 toyota corolla sr0 with 00000 and i am in the  only if you want to stop seriously though every 0 years you should have this done brake fluid absorbs water over time the water becomes steam when the fluid gets hot and steam compresses youll also have better luck with the longevity of master cylinder calipers and brake lines  jeff goss  
  when do the new mbenz c class cars come out the new nomenclature that mb has adopted will it only apply to the c class cars or will it also apply to the current s class cars does any one know what will replace the current 000 class since the c class will be smaller and more in line with the current 000  another question is bmw realising a new body style on the current 0 series and 0 series they seem to be a bit dated to me  
  there are two crank configurations for the flat 0 the most common one is probably the crank that is very similar to the i0 crank  which flat 0 engines have i0 style cranks    comparing those two engines the i0 and the flat 0 have no first order shaking forces or rocking moments  the i0 has a second order shaking force while the flat 0 has a second order rocking moment  the significant thing about the flat 0s second order moment is that it can be easily balanced out by adding mass at the ends of the crank  the i0 however requires a counter rotating shaft with mass to balance out the second order forces  i am 0000 sure that subaru and porsche use the boxer configuration and not the inline 0 crank that you analyzed and compared would you care to reevaluate the other case of a flat four  i think that this configuration is perfectly balanced as far as primary secondary forces and couples are concerned  i have an article in front of me that says so  bottom line  the biggest difference between the engines would probably be their intended use  the flat 0 is easier to fit under low hoods and in rear compartments for mid or rear mounting  the i0 can be mounted transversely to reduce hood length read cab forward other than that there isnt much fanfare to the differences between them no matter what subaru ads say  technology shared with porsche  indeed  the flat four is also shorter than an inline 0 so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length and a longitudinal placement is easier for a 0 wheel drive drivetrain  i think that subarus ads hold water  in practice their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline 0s and completely buzz free though some may not like its peculiar note  but as alfa has shown a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach   eliot  
     there is another advantage with manuals you can start the car by pushing it  and shifting into second gear this doesnt work with an automatic    peter    just for the record read your owners manual before attempting a push start most manufacturers today do not recommend this i think the catalytic converter is the primary reason  unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when the converter gets into its operating range  the best reason for a manual because you like to drive one i find that its much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car remember pay  attention out there  stupidity behind the wheel has still taken more people to the morgue than drunk driving the problem is that we dont revoke peoples license for stupidity  jeff goss  
       flat  000 deg v  horizonatlly opposed    usually it also equals boxer however i think the term is  traditionally reserved for 0s and 00s and firing order matters  this was talked about here in ra many months back i cant remember  the consensus    examples    ferraris 000tr is a flat 00 boxer  porsches 000 is a flat 0  subarus impreza is a flat 0    regards    brian   bmws boxer twin no two wheelers here been around since 0000 i think the other examples are johnny come latelies i may be wrong so no flames please  jeff goss  
  examples  ferraris 000tr is a flat 00 boxer porsches 000 is a flat 0 subarus impreza is a flat 0  i think you got it the other way round the ferrari flat 00 is a 000 degree v00 and not a true boxer while the subaru and porsche are true boxers  dont know about the vw bug though but i suspect that it is also a true boxer  eliot

   on the subject of the upcoming new mustang  i do not put much stock in the mag rags inside information or even ford rep quotes  the taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in its entirety  inside information had the taurus with a v0 and rearwheel drive at one point  i wouldnt look for a simple repaneled mustang folks you may be cheating yourself if you do  theres a lot of potential  ford hasnt released a new car without a 0wheel is in 0 years  the mustang project has been brewing for at least 0 right  a 0wheel is could happen  those modular v0s are out there too  in the interest of cafe and competition dont rule those out either   your ignorant if you do and there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there who really knows what itll look like  the mach iii  doubt it highly  the next mustang will be fords highest profile car  it attracts way more attention than the camarofirebird because its heritage is more embedded in the general public  dont lie to yourself and believe ford will forfeit that   the car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my car circle is that the  suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current cobra but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior after the mn00 thunderbird cost and weight debacle ford decided  independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive wont be tried again in  a volume car    the current 00l v0 will soldier on for about two years  a version of the 00 valve modular v0 in the mark viii could be offered then  ford is spending big money tooling up for 00l and 00l v0 engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future and therefore probably do not consider volume production of 000 hp v0 engines a priority   undisguised the car looks ok but not nearly as exciting as the new camarofirebird imo    i suspect ford will produce their car with higher quality than gm will  achieve with the camaro firebird  the way gm loses money the temptation to just get them out the door for the sake of positive cash flow will be  great once demand really takes off    tim gardner

   much discussion about economics of safety deleted  safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car i wont buy a  small car like a civic or whatever  great  safety  handling  speed    for me  seems to me that you would be more dead in a small car than a large car  after an accident  this is a very simplistic view of safety assuming that you are in a collision less likely with a more agile smaller car then the important factor is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you this is why a thousand pound f0 car can hit a wall at 000 and the driver walks out and why everybody dies when a suburban hits a wall at 00 as i recall for the last generation suburban hic numbers   as an aside just what is the point of an airbag it seems to me that seatbelts with pretensioners audi et al or a good tight 0 point belt  will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag you might be  saved from some flyign glass or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are wearing no seat belt   craig   gerrit     
   you guys are correct  the bricklin was produced in canada the national museum of science and technology here in ottawa has one and sometimes they put it on display  most of the time it stays in storage because the museum doesnt have much room its a big deal for a car to be canadian and thats why they  have it  if anybodys a fan they also have a nice green 00 riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom   mike harker ottawa ontario canada voice 0000000000   paul tomblin formerly ptgeovisiongvccom svens law theres exceptions to every law except this one  
    i am a little confused on all of the models of the 0000 bonnevilles i have heard of the le se lse sse ssei could someone tell me the differences are far as features or performance i am also curious to know what the book value is for prefereably the 00 model and how much less than book value can you usually get them for in other words how much are they in demand this time of year i have heard that the midspring early summer is the best time to buy  neil gandler  
  i have both an 00 and an 00 camry each with manual 0speed transmissions the 00 has about 000000 miles on it and the 00 about 00000 miles  about a year ago i found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the 00 was         leaking fluid around the piston seal leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car  i pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit new plunger seal etc and thought i had the problem licked  much to my surprise the same problem developed several months later  this time i looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches burrs or other obvious causes of the problem  i didnt find any  ever since i have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system  i knew i would be selling the car and didnt want to go all the way to solving the problem  i should add that the clutch is original and that ive had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch  my hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal the angle of the piston rod attached to the pedal is off the axix of the cylinder thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it  what do you think of that as an explanation  can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in  now the 00 same problem except that the above diagnosis doesnt explain why all of the fluid leaked out by way of the master cylinder into the passenger compartment while i was on vacation for 00 days during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort  what can you suggest here  many thanks  lets hope i dont end up going to click and clack on this  bill christensbarry ceruleanaccessdigexcom

  having recently purchased a 00 probe with clearcoat paint i  would like to give it a good wax job  what is the best type of wax to use for this type of finish  is paste or liquid better i would be waxing it by hand and buffing it by hand i guess using cheesecloth to buff it anything better you would suggest  ive heard comments here before about things like turtle wax and raindance not being very good so im wondering what is recommended for a quality finish  thanks in advance bill    bill heiser    heiseracsbuedu heiserworldstdcom                boston university boston ma

  the sound he describes is common to any older toyota engine i ever heard i dont know the relevance of his observations about oil changes my simply makes noise not all that annoying mind you but you hear it well when the engine is right behind your left ear   i think those with 00 mr0s would describe the engine as sweet if a little loud those with 00 mr0s i cant imagine any unbiased person paying it any compliments  sounded like my exdormmates rusty chevy chevette  with the 00 i would want to redline it just for the music with the 00 i would short shift so that it would shut up  the new camry 00 features balance shafts  i guess since the mr0 is getting the axe it is too late for them to do anything about this  it is no mystery that the turbo mr0 is only 0 liters the engineers had enough integrity to prevent any further abuses  also in europe the mr0 mk0 nonturbo was also only 0 liters as usual the undiscriminating american market if it is japanese it must be good gets the dogs to be fair we also got the turbo which the europeans did not    eliot    
  jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says  can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc  some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented  about this problem but i havent seen it happen on my 0 month old  00 probe gt  i think this may be something that ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars  also someone said that ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it  i have had my probe looked at twice by my local dealer where i purchased the car  the first time they made this problem worse  the second time after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my fordprobe mailing list they said they didnt know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and made it much better  however it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough roads and still squeals when i openclose the window in wet weather anyone elsess do this  ford only gives 0 key with the car  cmon ford spend an extra few pennies  i got two keys with my car but only one remoteentry pushbutton thingie but then i bought my 00 with 0000 miles and  i think it may have been a repossession  so im not surprised something was missing   horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference  i am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where it describes the procedure to follow if you discover something on your ford that could  cause  serious injury  threaten lives  etc  something about notifying the national traffic safety group as well as ford  those little youvegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep buttons are terrible  the latter is probably because of the air bag  its pretty much takes up all the space where youd expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns  well i guess thats good in a way but in a way its bad  when someone hears that kind of horn they expect to see a big american car  they may not associate the sound with a small jap car style car like the probe is  tires fling dirtmud onto side of car  yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes  the mudflaps help a lot  transmission the 0 speed is a must  i have always been a 0speed guy  almost every car ive ever owned has been a 0speed  because i got a good deal on this car with the 0000 miles i knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic  but it is a pretty hightech automatic  it is a fully electronicaly controlled 0speed with torque converter lockup  even with the automatic im getting 00 mpg on the highway driving 0000    but of course driving  00 is illegal so i  probably made that sentence up       around town the mileage has been around 0000 not bad for an automatic   of course it doesnt have the control of a 0speed but since i do a lot of city driving it turns out to be very convenient  its nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time although that too is illegal here in  weliketocontrolyourlife massachusetts    no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still  shakes and rattles has been my main gripe  ive gotten them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older  tires 00000vr00 goodyear eagles 00 left hoping for 00k   on my 00 probe gl i got about 00k out of the original goodyears and had driven the replacement tires bridgestone 00k miles when i tradeed the car  the 0000000vr00 firestones on my 00 probe look like theyre designed for performance ie rather wide shallow tread etc so they probably wont last as long  but the car handles very very very well  it sticks to the road like glue even on a rough surface  interior is very very nice too  very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound  definitely  fordmazda did a very very nice job on this one  the car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it  yes this cars stiff suspension isnt for everyone  i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car id strongly suggest looking into the mx0  having driven an 00 probe for 0 years i find the 00 suspension interesting the car actually drives much better than the 00  it is a very firm ride and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road  yet the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads  you hear and feel the bumps yet the car retains its posture very well  if you have 0 passengers by all means bring them along too  theyll find that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides differently if thats better is up to you    well i wouldnt encourage passengercarrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash  as mentioned in the consumer reports writeups consider the back seat as a parcel shelf  no biggie to me though if it had been id not have bought the car  but its definitely not a family car  also theres a lot of glass around you which i wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer  ac is a must on any probe from 00  00  the 00 in particular sends out a real blast of cool air when the ac is on max  that lots of glass you mentioned is what gives the car the very good visibility reports you see in all the writeups  most sportssporty cars dont have that good visibility  ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i havent heard about this one  i know that some of the very early probes 00 and maybe 00 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which  the complaints ive heard re exhaust system on 00s have been on  the gt  of course being a different engine that is a differeent  exhaust system  i was one of those with an 00 who qualified for the free replacement since i had already replaced the muffler when i received the notice  i wasam due a refund from ford  i applied in february and am still waiting     gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car  i was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering that i was expecting the worst from them  yes  i was pretty amazed when i had my car in for some touchup adjustments this past week and they had to keep it overnight too busy for them to get to it and they offered to pay for a rental  they  did make me pay for taxes and insurance though   from what ive heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with  the probe and probably mx0 when they first went into production but  i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point  thats almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though  i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm  but i seriously feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well    bill heiser    heiseracsbuedu heiserworldstdcom                boston university boston ma     
  tommy szeto writes  water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friends 00 ford probe  every  once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water  under the plywoodcarpet cover on the trunk  i would guess this usually   i noticed this is my 00 probe also when recently cleaning out the back  i   think the water is coming up through some rubber stoppered holes beneath the   spare  mine looked slightly worn and there was no water or water damage  i have the same problem with my 00 probe  the water is definitely not comming up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare  i have to remove the rubber stopper to drain the water  seems like a common problem with probe  there is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of 00 probes complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals  it is a known problem present on most if not all pre00 probes so you  shouldnt have to pay them to fix it  in my case they fixed it on my extended warranty i just had to pay a 00 deductable the work was valued at something like 000 with labor and parts  having removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions i think their estimate was fair     bill heiser    heiseracsbuedu heiserworldstdcom                boston university boston ma

   probably the most famous v00 is the one cadillac made from about 0000   to 0000  they had to scale down then because the great depression really put   the crimp on luxury cars  it had 000 cubic inches with over two hundred horse   power  they dont make them like they used to   there were others though  packard had one until about 0000 whe it down   sized to their legendary twinsix their mainstay for the next twenty years    lincoln and pierce arrow might have also had one but i am not two sure most luxury and semiluxury cars of this era at least experimented with   v00 if they did not actually produce them  there was actually a cylinder war   among the big three to see who could produce the biggest engine  big m   standard disclaimer applies because i cant think of anything wittier  
  review of 0000 ford taurus sho  by gene kim   background      last week i bought a 0000 ford taurus sho moving up from driving a 0000 toyota celica st and a 0000 oldsmobile cutlass  i have been interested in buying a sho for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in denver and chicago every week  i bought a remarkably clean maroonred sho with 00k miles on it for 0000 as far as i can tell this is about 0000 under blue book and i still have another 0000 miles before the extended service plan runs out      as one should with any pre0000 shos i made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments however my sho does not have the newer rod shifter  i understand i can get this for 000 from any ford service center  in addition the car received the full tuneup at 00k miles receiving new platinum plugs and valve adjustment      for a car with 00k miles on it the car was virtually immaculate the clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents although the front airdammolding was covered with lots of small scratches  not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the highway      having driven a smaller twodoor coupe for so long i was a bit concerned about whether i could get used to driving a larger car  to my surprise the size of the car doesnt bother me at all  it seems just as nimble as my celica  no comparisons with my oldsmobile   visibility from the drivers seat is excellent helped mostly by of the small the quarterwindows aft of the backseat door windows and in front of the cpillar and rear window  parallel parking is a bit more difficult but other than that i love the size      in fact im starting to appreciate the large trunk as i pack up for a 00hour drive to washington dc for the summer  more on the ride later in this review   engine          as with anyone even slightly interested in shos i was very interested in the 00valve 00l yamaha shogun engine  i was not disappointed  base performance of the engine under 0000 rpms is good  you can even do reasonable launches from second gear although i dont make a practice of this  the engine revs smoothly and eagerly  tooling around town does not require many shifts  this is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car more on this later      while the performance of the engine under 0000 rpms may be unremarkable it undergoes a jekyllhyde transformation once you hit higher revs  at 0000 rpms a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open up  the engine soars to its 0000 rpm redline and you are treated to in my opinion the sweetest sounding v0 around the engine inexplicably sounds overjoyed to be at 0000 rpm      ive noticed that when i drive around town i constantly watch the tach to see how far below 0000 rpm i am  to go from 0000 rpm to 0000 you may have to punch the accelerator  while torque is more than adequate it doesnt come fully online until those other 00 valves are used   transmission      when car and driver first reviewed the car in 0000 they marvelled at how ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car  i remember driving a friends parents sho in 0000 and remember thinking about whether i had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic  the clutch was that stiff  that was back then      the entire clutch assembly on my sho has been replaced under a ford recall in 0000  the clutch on the sho feels no stiffer than the one on my toyota celica  in fact the friction point seems a bit larger and more forgiving      when playing with the shifter with the car parked the shifter felt very reasonable  the 00 and 00 gates were where youd expect it to be and the shifting action was smooth  on the road its much the same  but you have to shift slowly  make no mistake its a clumsy shifter      when hurrying shifts like when i was initially trying to impress friends i consistently miss the 00 shift often grope clumsily for the 00 shift and sometimes even muff the 00 shift  i find this pretty amazing in a car like this      it also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your time  seems obvious but compared to my toyota and my friends honda this seems atrocious and clumsy someone on recautos noted that crxs should blow shos offtheline because of the incredibly clumsy shifter      i now shift much more sedately and the shifter seems more reasonable  when you play within these bounds the shifter works smoothly with no surprises  i dont know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all      along these same lines i initially had trouble shifting gears smoothly  again slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely  this took several days for me to get the hang of  i think some of my problems were because ive never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher gears      occasionally i have trouble shifting into reverse  the shifter refuses to enter the gate and i often grind the synchros trying to  get it into gear  ill be watching this carefully in the next couple of months      a quirk  when i upshift and the engine drops back to 00000000 rpm i hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine compartment  not terribly loud but the passenger can definitely hear it  i asked about it when i was looking at the car as do all my passengers  apparently this is a definitely a sho sound and is the gearbox  apparently called gear rollover replies to my queries on recautos are at the end of this review   exterior      as i mentioned before i am astounded by how well the body of this sho has stood up  paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually nonexistent  looking at how older tauri sometimes dont age so gracefully i wonder what the guys at ford did differently to the sho bodies      the body in my opinion is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock tauri  for some odd reason the sho seems different enough from vanilla tauri to get stares at stoplights  of course this could be my overactive imagination   shos get fog lights a more open grille a completely monochromatic exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back with sho stenciled in relief  ive seen a couple shos whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in black  yuck      i dont think the car is flashy  i like it that way  i feel almost anonymous with all those tauri out there but different and distinctive enough to those of us who care     interior      the interior is what really makes me feel like i dont deserve the car  the seats are grey leather the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather and the entire instrument panel is done in a blackgreymetallic scheme        the instrumentation is stock taurus except for the 000 mph speedo and 0000 rpm tach  you get a center console with two cupholders a large compartment under the radio great for a cd player an armrest that contains yet another compartment three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways i think and a compartment for holding cassette tapes  theres mapholders in the doors and an oddly small glove compartment      i spilled a whole can of coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a sink  hey im really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its design  and its a 0000 before the interior was upgraded      the backseat is bigger than any car ive had  why do they need so much space    no smartass comments please        the driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters  from what i hear its not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear mine is no exception  the left side bolster on the drivers has cracked and im not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the way      a big surprise for me  i forgot that shos dont have a normal hand parking brake  instead they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot  too bad  again im getting used to it but it seems a bit anachronistic to me   ride      the suspension is nice and stiff  too stiff  its stiffer than any car ive had  a friends new 0000 toyota celica st seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps better  the sho seems stiffer with less ability to soak up bumps  driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring affair  on the other hand taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesnt flex at all  i listened for that before i bought the car      on the highway the ride is great  when i drove the car from chicago back to purdue i had trouble keeping under 00 mph let alone from trying to see what 000 mph really feels like  its a relatively quiet ride but the sunroof rattles  ive tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there but it seems to be the window that rests on the rails  no easy way to get rid of it i think      over the past three days ive oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too rough  not for me mind you  but i wonder whether i would advise my dad to buy one for himself  but ive discovered as with the shifter if you take your time with shifts youll have no reason to complain  let me explain      the ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the wheels  i feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and right  after i understood this i avoid the limits of traction  and im a happy camper again      its not body rigidity but the composure of the car      as if matching the suspension the steering feel is quite heavy my first impression of driving my sho was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway speeds  it tracks straight as an arrow but when driving around a parking lot the higheffort steering didnt seem so useful  however its reasonable but it doesnt communicate the road to the driver as well as a 0000 ford probe gt  imho its much better than the steering on my celica st      i wonder how bad this car is during winter   miscellaneous notes      gripes      the rattles from the sunroof is intermittent  some days it rattles         loudly other days i look up wondering where all the noise went      activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy  loud squealing as it retracts on its rails  i wonder if there is a quick fix for this again other days it completely disappears  function of humidity      once i made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension and torque steer ive never complained about ride      i wish the seats had more support under the thighs  also i wish the side bolsters would close more tightly        i hear that tires for this car can get really expensive  i currently have goodyear gt0s that cost the previous owner 000 for four      i used to hate the ford stereo systems  whose idea was it to use a volume paddle  now to my amazement i dont really mind  and sometimes think its an okay idea pretty ridiculous though      getting up to 0000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore  but this is no big deal  there is more than enough torque down low      i often goof up the shifting when driving with friends  it took me a couple of days before i could really shift smoothly from 0nd to 0rd gear  hard to believe isnt it      my car has almost 00000 miles on it  my parents noted that it is almost impossible to find a lowmileage sho  astute observation imho  i wonder how long i can make my sho last  i just bought a book titled drive it forever for tips in this department        the goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop  i once parked the car in gear and then accidentally let out the clutch after i started it  the car jolted forward and bounced off the car in front of me  no paint damage at all but starting the car  is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal  also i began  to wonder how strong that brake really is  today i backed out of  parking spot today and started to drive away before i noticed  the glowing brake light  oops      the drivers power window creaks when closed all the way  the same     thing happens in my parents 0000 mercury sable  oddly all the other windows work smoothly       likes      im liking the interior amenities more and more each day  the     cupholders are great      i didnt expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much but it really is handy  you can lock all the doors by pressing the 00 and 000 buttons together  neat  and you can never lock yourself out of the car      i really feel like i dont deserve this car  i really cant believe that i could afford it  i got this car ten years  ahead of schedule        i love this car so much that ive been telling my parents to look into buying one  i love this car so much that i wrote this 00k file  i meant to write a couple of lines and ended up with this        if there were a jd powers survey for used car owners i would have an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this  car  i dont like thinking about getting another car but at this point in time im sure id buy another sho  for under 0000 you cant beat it  next time with an airbag and abs though      insurancewise this car is also a big win  i pay the same premiums as on my 0000 toyota celica  despite that it has nearly twice the horsepower      other odds and ends      much to my amazement there is no sho mailing list anywhere maybe because the sho registry publication has filled this void  i havent joined yet but ive noticed that queries about shos still appear on recautos about once a month  owners of shos are always quick to respond and are very vocal fans of the cars  maybe some of the most vocal on recautos        ive put together the responses to my questions about the cars as well as other posts with useful information on these cars  ill be  posting this in the form of a faq soon        if anyone is interested in starting a mailing list please speak up i dont know if i have the resources here at purdue to start one but  maybe someone out there does   gene kim genekmentorccpurdueedu

     i was recently thumbing through the 0000 lemonaid new car guide  what i found was a car would be given a recommended under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed in a front end collision  the most highly recommended small car the civic has the worst crash rating of all of the small cars listed  there were many such cases of great vehicles where you wouldnt survive an accident  is it only me or is safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car                                                                    imho the best way to reduce risk when operating a vehicle is being able to avoid hazards and for that reason my preferred vehicle is a motorcycle  when i do use a four wheeler my primary reasons are it will keep me dry it will keep me warm or it will carry more cargo  if the four wheeler has as much collision protection as the average motorcycle then it has enough form me  how do you define safe  one definition of safe is without risk  is     chas                         dod 0000  oh how can you be in two places at once when youre not anywhere at all                                                 firesign theatre

   however if you agree some terms and then when about to sign the dealer slips you a contract with different terms and leads you to believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to that is fraud  there is no 0 day limit on restitution for fraud  you may have to sue and win to get out of this  you will almost certainly have to threaten to sue    on the other hand remember the old adage that a verbal agreement isnt worth the paper its printed on  once you sign you are going to have one hell of a time proving fraud based on a comparison to what you thought you were going to sign   being in the right is one thing proving it is another     brian g gordonbriangsuncom    briangnetcomcom       bgordon0 on genie000000000 on compuservebgordon on aol

  i am considering the purchse of a 0000 vw jetta gli with 00k miles on it i recently found out that there are two versions of the gli  0v and 00v i know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same name  the 00v version has 00 more horsepower 0 wheel discs and a standard sunroof  oops thats the difference between the gli 00v and the regular gl  so in addition to the engine what other differences exist between the two models of the jetta gli  more importantly how can i tell which version this one is   there are no badges that said 00v so i am inclined to think that is the 0v version assuming this one the one i looked at is the 0v version is there a valid reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped gl which would cost less  of course i would love to get the 00v version but money talks  please email any responses  thank you peter volpe pv0000albnyvmsbitnet  
  in article 0qn0loc0svelaacsoaklandedu mjepookiepasswayneedu michael j edelman writes the big disadvantage of automatics is the 00 hp they consume that never gets to the wheels  in this respect they are at a disadvantage to a manual  only when the torque converter is not locked up  there are autos out there with converter lock up in 0nd 0rd and 0th gears  dont forget that now that new 0 speed manual trannys are available the drive train is more optimally geared to get the most out of the engine  rare so are 0 speed autos but very real  bottom line is both manuals and automatics have vastly improved  i think that automatics have advanced far more than manuals especially in shift intelligence  i say that a smart automatic is better than the majority of drivers in terms of being in the right gear at the right time which to me is more important than torque converter losses  i prefer the stick for fun and the auto for traffic  who says you cant have your cake and eat it too  a well designed shifter will easily facilitate manual clutchless shifts  i am referring to the much copied mercedes jagged gate  the only department where you lose out is in the number of ratios available and of course the converter losses  if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission it cant be half bad     eliot

  why anyone would order an sho with an automatic transmission is beyond me if you cant handle a stick you should stick with a regular taurus and leave the sho to real drivers that is not to say that there arent real drivers who cant use the stick eg disabled persons but they arent in any position to use an sho anyway   actually disabled persons have been known to drive in scca races  id be careful about making sweeping generalizations here  id prefer a manual transmission but the early sho had an awful transmission that felt like it came out of a truck or something it was almost enough to make me want an automatic  teddy

  goldbergoasysdtnavymil mark goldberg writes  in recautos jmhhoppervirginiaedu jeffrey hoffmeister writes my suggestion stay where you are or shop around but stay away from geico  i strongly agree with jeff  heres my horror story  many years back i switched to geico from state farm to save some   i have a relatively new sports car for which we covered with liability collision and comprehensive  with this make of car new models came out in january not september like other makes  the car was purchased in august of that year  we also had a much older clunker for which we only wanted liability   low and behold a vandal slashed the roof of the sports car and we put  in a claim  this was in october  still the current model year for the car   a new top with installation was 000  we had 00 deductible so we should have gotten 00  you had to go to geicos local office to have an adjuster see the car unlike state farm that sent the adjusters to the shop or your place  he said since the car is now one year old well depreciate the top by 00 so youll get 00 on the claim this will also count as an accident against you so your rate may increase  the hassle continued  then we got a letter from geico saying claim denied  your policy on this car doesnt cover this  i then learned that their records had the full coverage collision etc on our old clunker and only had liability for this new car  they mixed up our cars in their records  i fixed the top myself with some carpet thread and dropped my claim  they still charged me with an accident i cancelled my policy and switched to another company  the coup de gras came when they sent me a bill for an additional balance due for the difference in collisioncomprehensive cost between my sports car and my clunker  i returned the bill unpaid with a nastygram plus explicity directions to perform rectocranial insertion havent heard from them since                everyones entitled to my opinion                goldbergoasysdtnavymil imagination is more important than knowledge  albert einstein   good for you  i am convinced that someone should start a boycott  against geico  any takers       chintan amin the university of illinois urbanachampaign mail llamauiucedu sig under construction hard hat area

  daubendrnextworkrosehulmanedu darren r daubenspeck writes    they are pretty much junk stay away from them  they will be replaced next  year with all new models     junk  theyve made the cd lists for years due to their excellent handling and   acceleration  they have been around since about oh 00 or 00 so theyre not   the newest on the lot and mileage is about five to eight mpg under the class   leader  you can get into a 00 l v0 000 hp shadow for 0000k the i0   turbo a bit more and a droptop for 0000k      as an exfleet mgr of 0000 cars they were amoung the most trouble free of all models  i bought one for my wife    nnnnnnnng thank you for playing i cannot agree with this  i believed this and to put it nicely it was a piece of junk  i loved this car i babied it i pampered it and after 0 years it just couldnt stay together i would say that not everyone will have the problems that i had but know this its not just the car it is the ability to get the car fixed which will not happen at any chryslerdodgetake your pick dealer  i dont care if there are going to reform their dealersservice with the intro of the lh cars i will believe it when i see it  case and point the local dodge dealer  you drive up just looking you dont even get out of your door when about 00 yes 00 salesman all eye you like their next meal and literally pounce on you and try to get you to make a deal on everything your eye wanders towards service is about 0 times worse than that  i had an alignment problem but they tried to tell me that the k frame was bent and about 0000 dollars of workparts to fix it  let me tell you the problems i had and i took care of this car i put alot of miles on it in the first couple years but took it to every checkup it needed and many that shouldnt have been  0000 dodge shadow es  these were replaced within the 0 years that i owned the car  engine  0 alternators rear suspension torsion bar 0 water pumps 0 thermostats hall effect sensor main computer 0 batteries  these were rebuiltrepaired  radiator automatic transmission power steering   those are just the things i can remember off the top of my head  for about a year before i sold the car i said to myself its a good car i just cant find anybody competent enough the fix it  in the end before i traded it in for a saturn the power steering started acting up again  i just stopped putting money into it  i must have put at least 00000000 worth of repairs over its lifetime  i am sorry but lee iacocca can bite me  bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the hell do you think that lh has been nicknamed last hope  you can do better and i know people will disagree with me here but japanese like honda or toyota or the only american car company that i feel is a quality product saturn  i will not touch another chrysler product again no way  i dont care how good the lh cars look good and i will admit they look promising but not with the support that you get  gm isnt much better thank god they dont control saturn like they do their divisions or it would be just another marketing ploy    dont get me wrong i will be watching my car which i do like like a hawk for the next 0 years  i am much more hesitant to say it or any car is really good until it has proved itself to me  but since someone else pointed out cd as a source  i will note because i used to read these magazines that car and driver has never had a good thing to say about most chrysler products shadow for one always were they moaning about the reguritated kcar and engine  whereas motor trend always thought they were great cars  no car magazine is really objective  and although there are alot of people who dont like consumers reports i will use them to reinforce my argument i already know about the big stink with the saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are the shadowsundance rate much worse than average in fact none of the chryslers rate a better than average i think the best one is just average  excluding the diamond starmitsubishi stuff and the lhs  you can find bad stuff about the shadow  try as i might when i researched the saturn i could not find anything bad about it  there is a great deal of information about this company just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for good reason  much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company  i read an article which had a subcolumn an i think this imprinted on me more than anything else  some big wig in toyota said and i quote we are watching them very closely  come on everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to set in their ways which is one of the reasons saturn was created  they are still struggling because they havent learned yet  they have the ability the workers are not inferior the technology is not out of date but their attitude is and they are just finding this out  its called competition gentlemanwomen if you dont satisfy the demand of the consumer well your out    asbestos suit on  gaia   
  i looked at that bimmer yesterday its an 00 has about 00kmi according to owner odometer stopped working at 00kmi drivess well sounds good body is ok he wants 0000 i liked the car despite its auto tranny but my wife will be a primary driver on this one and she wants auto the radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn  the ac seems to have a leak  the sunroof is sticky but operational odometer does not work as mentioned before idle is a bit bouncy going from 000rpm to 0000rpm wipers are slow thats teh gripes the owner says that he changed radiator alternator  rotors and calipers exhaust the biggest problem is that the owner is a shifty sob telling strange stories i hate that i would never buy from a persom like that except how often you see a descent 000i for that amount of money he also said that although i could bring a mechanicin he wouldnt let me check the car by taking  it to a garage suspicious and who knows what milage is on it so let me know what to check for given theres practically no rust i know there was an article on 000i in rd a few years back anybody remembers what issue mikes

  i have a 00 buick skylark with 000k on it  i bought it in california and if itll let me id like to keep it for another year  the only problem is these indiana wintersmy heater controls dont work  the car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents  right now it is stuck in the vent mode  it will blow warm air but i cant switch the air flow to either the floor i can live without this or the defrost i cant  live without this  i probably could just jam the air deflector to the  defrost position but this blows a lot of air in my face and is well kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse  i have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and i think the problem or part of it is with the two diaphragms which control updown and outsideinside air flow  the diaphragm which controls outsideventin sideno vent air is cracked most of the way around and the other one is probably damaged too considering the advanced age of the car  two questions  0  is there anything i should be aware of about this other than the fact that i should move from indiana   0  in the event that replacement diaphragms arent available is there a way to fix this  thanks for any adviceinfo  selah  dan lovallphysicspurdueedu

   just a quick simple question really  how many wheels are affected by the emergency brake on an 00 nissan maxima ive heard that all four are affected but this would seem unusual to me i thought the emergency brake on most cars only affected the rear wheels also how powerful is the emergency brake usually enough to lock wheels at 00mph hmmmm i just have to wonder about some of the things i hear  outatime    
   i was curious as to what people thought of the vw corrado vr0 thats about it  outatime    
  now now before we get too carried away here  keep in mind that owning any car in korea is a luxury that only the ruling class can afford  every government agency worth its salt finds some reason to levy a tax on car ownership last i heard there were seven different fees to pay to own a car  i believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic inefficiency that new president kim young sam wants to eradicate  basically i think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class  in exchange zaibatsus like hyundai screwed over smaller companies perpetuating a vicious cycle i have faith that korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone else but for now hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society of screwy components that wont work together  stubborn like a mule the car either wont go forward or wont stop at all  hahahahahaha  gasp  pant  hm im not sure whether the above was just a silly remark or a serious remark  but in case there are some misconceptions i think henry robertson hasnt updated his data file on korea sincemid 0000s  owning a car in korea is no longer a luxury  most middle class people in korea can afford a car and do have at least one car  the problem in korea especially in seoul is that there are just so many privatelyowned cars as well as taxis and buses the rushhour has become a 00 hour phenomenon and that there is no place to park  last time i heard back in january the kim administration wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide his or her own parking area just like they do in japan  also henry would be glad to know that hyundai isnt the only car manufacturer in korea  daewoo has always manufactured cars and i believe kia is back in business as well  imported cars such as mercury sable are becoming quite popular as well though they are still quite expensive  finally please ignore henrys posting about korean politics and bureaucracy  hes quite uninformed   t h brian chung           happiness is         this sig was brought jfealchemytncornelledu  tea earl grey hot  to you by frungy the jfecornellabitnet         000 lake st apt 00a  sport of kings cesr00thc                 ithaca ny 00000         
  anyone else experiencing a similar problem  this concerns the clutch on a 00 honda accord 0 speed when the clutch is first used in the morning about the first 0 miles of shifting there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up  then the clutch shifts smoothly  this chatter started when i moved to the san  francisco bay area from a lowhumidity environment  the dealer stated that this is known to happen since honda changed from an asbestos to nonasbestos clutch material  no remedy seems that moisture on clutch surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates  any comments out there

  i have a few questions about the tax on  a used car purchase i live in new york state and i am going to buy a used car i know that i will have to pay tax when i go to register the car but i would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car or on the purchase price  also what tax rate is used   the owner lives in albany 0 tax and i will be living in saratoga with 0 tax   do i pay albany tax or saratoga tax   the difference is a whole 00 one more thing how much does it cost for the usual 0 year registration   did i leave anything out  what else might i have to know to purchase and register a used car   ive never done this before  thank you peter volpe  
  hi there ive recently been toying with the idea of purchasing an old 000 the going rate seems to be about 0000 for cars with anywhere from 0000k mi my question is this what should i expect at this price should i expect to have extensive body work done what about engine  transmission should i likewise expect to have both virtually replaced along those lines does anyone have the names  addresses of any mailorder parts suppliers for everything from engine to body parts im completely new to the area of restoring cars and as i dont actually do any work with cars most of the work would have to be professionally done what sould i expect the cost of upgrading a 000 to a rustfree mechanically sound automobile thanks in advance andre     true 000 enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this but ill dump my impressions  ive wanted to own a 000 for about 00 years now came close once but i ended up buying a fiero instead biggest mistake of my life  anyway for 0000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit the most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the engine and passenger compartment  also look for chassis welded together here  oh yeah the price range you are talking about must be the 0 banger a 0 if you could find one would be mucho more bucks  parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by for an old car and you can even locate crude in the jc whitney catalog if you have too  the machine itself is pretty simple they use the spare tire for windshild washer instead of a pump fer chris sake so getting it fixed by a good bugporsche mechanic would be easy  since it is midengine you may spend more on labor for any mechanical work   jeff miller                 network systems corporation internetwork group          0000 boone avenue north jmillernetworkcom         minneapolis mn 00000   0000000000

  im considering switching to geico insurance but have heard that they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  i was worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  i have also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident   im interestend in determining whether or not these things are true has anyone out there with geico made a claim  id be interested in hearing whether or not you were satisfied with the service and whether you then had trouble renewing your policy   im also interested in any good or bad stories about liberty mutual or state farm   geico supports reads gives to police laser radars  they have been known  to be very picky  no sports cars no radar detectors although maryland  insurance board over rules this consistantly no turbos  basically it seems if you need to use your insurance ever they dont want  you  they once told me they wouldnt insure me perfect record because of  my corvette even though it would be insured by another specialty insurance   we must insure all the cars  i think this rep didnt know what she was  talking about  geico is cheap  but if you ever file a claim be prepared to be dropped  i  think in most areas two tickets will do it  geico will never see a dime from me if i can help it  state farm  slighty higher than most but very good response  not as picky  as geico

  if you want to annoy geico call them upgive fake namebut real car  specsget a quote and then tell them they are more expensive than your  current state farmallstate insurance  they will still send you quote etc then you can tear up their quote and stuff it in the prepaid return  envelope and mail it back to them  actually they were 00 more than my current state farm rates   actually ive had a bad habit of stuffing a whole bunch of other garbage junk mail in along with whatever else into anybodys prepaid envelopes until they almost burst  i believe they pay postage by weight heh heh heh  anyways dont tear up the quotes just yeti sometimes use their quotes or other insurance quotations as leverage to haggle for a lower rate elsewhere  usually it works to your advantage if  they are lower  aaron

  its been a while since ive reviewed a car but today i paid a visit to an old friend whose love for audis has been so overwhelming that he makes a not too sucessful living selling them  without further delay i will get to the 0000 audi s0   0 servotronic steering  for those who are not familiar with what servotronic is it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by zf and used in audis and bmws  i have been outspoken in my damming of servotronic over the past couple of months and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the audi 00 cs quattro and the audi 000cs fwd  i am quite happy to report now that on the s0 the servotronic is inoffensive  i suppose that due to the fat gumball tires the servotronic has been loaded up more and this so far has been the best implementation that i have tried  it is far from perfect mind you and id be much happier if it was an option that i could refuse but on the s0 i no longer consider this to be bad enough where i feel the entire car is ruined  the steering is still a tad too light but it is accurate and i suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the drivers hands  so there is feel and there is accuracy in the s0s steering  but there is also room for improvement  i consider the s0s steering to be better than the japanese competition primarily because the japanese do not believe in feel and engineer it out completely   0 engine  wheee what a pressure cooker  with just 000 miles on the clock i did not expect the s0 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out 00000 miles later but still the car packs a terrific punch  for a turbocharged machine it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving  ie low revs high gear  it is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that theres only 00 liters of displacement to move this 0000 pound car around in such a fashion  with maximum torque available at 0000 rpm and a 0000 rpm redline the car can pretty much be left in third all day which translates to a speed range of something like 00000 mph  a chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity v0s the technical achievement is breadthtaking  throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine in fact it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame downshifts are almost unnecessary  it is more fun to use the overboost feature than to rev the engine  for those not familiar the s0 engine features up to 00 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing  sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter one could with the right foot only in third gear blast the car from 00 to 00 in just a few moments simply by flooring the gas  as far as the numbers go maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 000 lb ft incredible for a 00 liter  it takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for  since this is quite a heavy car ones body parts are not flung around like say the corrado vr0  the acceleration is smooth and strong somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff  also one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding 0 banger  yes audi has refined the 0 to the point where at 0000 rpm it sounds as serene as it does at 0000  the smoothness is outstanding but not quite up to the standards of a very good 0 eg a 00 valve bmw  id say that in terms of refinement ie willingness to rev smoothness lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many v0s  however lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 0 cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful if not terribly refined the 00 valve turbo 0 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost  subjectively id rate the vw vr0 engine as being far more musical than the turbo 0 also audis own v0 is also far more musical with a rorty race car growl when pressed  though none of these can match its grunt  the only hint of the engines true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop  with the extra inertia from the permanently engaged 0wd system one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall  alternately one could use more revs in both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine  i think that audi of america should offer an automatic option for this car just as they offer though in extremely small numbers a 0 speed for the much peakier v0  the characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic  ironically in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush  marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again   0 chassis  ive noticed that audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths  the car comes with firestones of size 00000 zr00 which is not uncommon at all  however the very attractive 0 spoke wheels are no less than 0 inches wide so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever  combined with the flared wheel arches the s0 has a mouth watering macho yet subdued look   on rough concrete it becomes immediately clear that the new 000 body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression i suppose the two are interrelated but i digress  to use a cliche the s0s body feels like it has been carved out of stone  flex is totally undetectable even when going over rough roads  with a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the s0s ride quality will never worry a lexus it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars  the servotronic steering has already been mentioned  i consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering  i  was able to test the cars cornering powers without too much trepidation i think a new concept is at work in this car  with its fat gumball tires talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless  on a banked highway on ramp i went in slow and started applying power as i went around  i could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways  yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs it felt that the limits were not even close to being approached  the g forces were thrilling but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving  you tell the car what you want and it does it  end of story  i think that i am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the honda nsxs clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car  the brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too though ive read that they are prone to fade  i am not too surprised since the s0 does not have uprated brakes over the base audi 000 fwd harder pads would help but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold  i am starting to see a trend among the luxurysports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity  the ls000s fade performance is nothing to brag about neither is the q00s or the legends  brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybodys attention is focused on antilock capability   0 comfort  for a car with such sporty abilities its comfort levels are also excellent  the cabin is beautifully appointed with carbonfiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the 00 s0  all the expected gizmos are there heated seats power seats seat memory power this and that  the glaring ommision was the trip computer which was removed because audi hasnt gotten it to work reliably yet that means that the car has no boost gauge  a real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance    unusual for the germans the s0 comes with a honda style moonroof as well as the very intelligent dialasunroofposition rotary switch  noise levels including engine and tire noise is so low that i wouldnt consider the lexus advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer   0 conclusion  even though few will be able to afford an audi s0 at its sticker price of 00k the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition  the 00 valve turbo 0 is a real gem even if it doesnt produce ferrari sounds  no other luxurysports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some is worth the extra money all by itself  the safety

  derek  there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights will come back on after 00 weeks the tool is in fact illegal in europe  atleast it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a  used bmw and a few weeks later all the lights come on other than that i know  of no other tool anyone else   about changing oil every 00000 miles thats ok on newer audis they  only require it after every 00000 miles i am talking about an oil change just a query do you drive your car very very carefully like no sudden  acceleration etc if yeah then the 00000 m oil change seems quite reasonable but if you drive kinda fast id get a bit up tight abot that 00000 thingy  a point to note just because the first light came on at 0k doesnt mean all the others will come on every 0k too  shaz

       i used to drive a truck a few years back i once rode with an old codger that had been driving for about 00 yrs the only time he would use the clutch was to get the truck moving he could shift that 00 speed lightning quick up or down without the slightest rake of a gear he was as smooth as silk it was the most amazing shifting demonstration ive ever seen having said all that i  still dont know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without a clutch why do it  
  i went to a place called american car care centers to check my car for ac leak  after checking i was told that there is a leak in the compressor seal  at the end in addition to the labor for the check i was charged 00 dollars for a pound of freon although they evacuated my ac afterwards because of the leak  first is it fair for him to charge me for a pound of freon 00 plus tax   second what can i do about this if this is unfair    albert wu  for the information of those not lucky enough to live in the city of austin tx if an auto ac system is checked and found to have leaks it must be repaired at that time or evacuated  this is an ordinance unique i think to the city of austin  freon is subject to increasing taxes but 00 is about 0x cost here recovered freon is not required to be purchased from the car it is withdrawn from  as a matter of practice some shops here are charging  a recycling fee that is less than the cost of the freon removed if it  is reintroduced to the system  just another quality service from an enviornmentally conscious city    rick kirchhof   austin texas                    experience is what you domain rickposmsaustxus                     get when you dont bang path cfiorgposmsrick              get what you want

  in my opinion the limited tort option is the best thing casey has ever done basically limited tort means that you give up your right to sue for pain and suffering unless one of the following conditions is met 0 your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed x where x is some number like 00000  im not sure of the exact number  0 the accident was caused by a drunk driver i mean the other driver was drunk  0 you get a good lawyer and have a good case basically you can appeal to regain your right to sue but theres almost no chance of this ever happening  you are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering you can still sue for medical costs actual damages etc by agreeing to limited tort you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery in exchange you get a substantial reduction in your rates i save 000year  unfortunately the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse people so much that only about 0 of pennsylvanians go for limited tort i guess thats ok  if more people opted for it the insurance companies would be pushing harder for repeal

  from article 0000apr0000000000000sequentcom by troysequentcom troy wecker    earlier i commented on the valentine0 and jimfcenterlinecom replied  about the value of the units bogey counter  i didnt really go into  why i called this feature a gimmick so here is more explanation  thanks  jim for the good comments and opinion            from what i understand the valentine0 can only tell if these  microwaves are coming from the front rear or both  there are only  two antennas  if they are coming from both this in interpreted as a  side bogey  bogey counts are determined as sources by their  relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the  same source           it sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not actually using the valentine0  id like to give some feedback based on real life experince  i keep the valentine0 in advanced logic mode and it rarely lights up as a christmas tree  the only time it does is when i am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes sense that is does since there are  0 sources coming from many different directions  i have found the valentine0 to be consistent in its reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area  i have found the directional indication to be very useful  in one case there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other  as i passed the first radar trap the direction indication changed  then the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction  with other radar detectors i would have assumed that this was due to a reflection but with the valentine0 i knew there was a high probability that there was another trap  and there was  on other occasions the directional helped discern a false alarm from a true alarm  for example as i pass a source the direction indicator changes  the directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the  place  when a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector that leaks i can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the car passes me i can verify the source  with other detectors i would have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar trap when there was none  ive had the valentine0 for several months now and find its added features to be useful and not gimmicks                                         barry                                                                       barry frishberg                                             blfapollochhpcom chelmsforduk expert center                                      000tn 0000000 chelmsford ma

  hi i need your help with a problem i have with a 0000 mitsubishi galant gs transmission  the car has a 0 speed manual tranmission since the car was bought new while shifting from 0nd to 0rd  unless  i do it slowly and carefully it makes a popping or hitting sound the dealer and mitsubishi customer service reached by an 000  say  this is normal for the car  is it and about a year ago at 00kmiles the stick shift handle got stuck while attempting to put it in reverse    0 the shifter would not budge  the clutch had no effect    0 the front tires would not budge even when the clutch is       fully depressed    0 if the clutch is released the engine would die    0 assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was       stuck i could not make the car move  it acted as if       it were in neutralexcept for dying when clutch is released    0 i finally was able to release the shifter by having        someone rock the car back and forth less than an inch       while i depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter    0 the shifter acted normally after that  when this happened i took it to the dealer they checked the  clutch it was ok they checked the transmission it was ok  i had the exact problem a couple of months ago and again last week  the dealer says there is nothing they can do because  mitsubishi the 000  says they have never heard of the problem and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car   in all three occurances the car was parked head first in a garage and since the front wheels were stuck the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter hence temporarily solving the problem  and the dealer and mitsubishi refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck  i know there is smething wrong with the transmission shifting  from 0nd to 0rd and getting stuck at random but i cant get  the dealer to fix it i need your help with the mechanical problems  and with how to handle mitsubishi   all hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated and sorry to bore you with the long post  thanks rabih

  talking about car alarms there are certain cars in this country that are  only insurable if they are fitted with a vecta alarm were talking coswoths and porsches and stuff just before they the insurance companies decided to  make this move they insisted that the car be fitted with a scorpion alarm  now theyve changed to the vecta so everyone whos spent  on fitting  the scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the vecta system  sad huh shaz

  i got a price quote of 0000000 for a camry v0 wabs from a toyota dealer in  eatontown i came back to that dealer in two weeks to sign a purchase agreement then i was told that the salesperson made an error in pricing i walked out of  that dealer i wonder if this kind of practice is common with toyota dealers  is the price quote written on the salespersons business card binding i would appricate any comments   i had a similar experience  we had a written quote which had been mailed to us from the salesman at one of these nohaggle toyota dealers for a camry xle wabs leather etc  the price seemed fair but when we went in to take them up on their offer they discovered that certain extra cost items hadnt been included in their original written quote it would have totaled an extra 0000 and in spite of the fact that we had a written quote they said there was nothing they could do  bottom line quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that the toyota dealers think theyve got such a superior auto that they dont have to deal  we walked went out and bought a new lh car eagle vision tsi and i dont regret it one bit   thad mcculloch mccullocmailldsloralcom

  gibbonsafrasersfuca darren gibbons writes  im looking for information on opel cars  now you ask which model well the sad truth is im not entirely sure but its a twoseater with rollover headlights hard top and really sporty looking  my friend has one sitting in his yard in really nice condition bodywise but he transmission has seized up on him so it hasnt run for a while  does anyone have any info on these cars  the engine compartment looks really tight to work on but it is in fine shape and i am quite interested in it  that would be the opel gt sold in this country from 00 to 00  it originally had a 0000 cc engine which was later replaced by the 0000 cc  it was based on the old kadett drive train and suspension with leaf springs in the rear and a single transverse leaf spring in the front  it looked good but was limited as a performer  there has also been some discussion in this thread about the manta and other models  in 0000 opel introduced a new line of models the 0000 series that were also known as model numbers 00 00 etc  these cars had the newer 0000cc engine and were available as two and fourdoor coupes a station wagon and a sport coupe known in europe as the manta  at the same time there were two 00series cars which sold very few numbers that also had the 0000 engine but the kadett suspension  the sport coupe model 00 was also available as the rallye 00r with a blacked out hood tach and fog lights but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio  in 0000 the sport coupe was also named the manta in the us  0000 was the last year for the gt in any country both because of the us bumper height regulations and the fact that fiat exercised an option on the factory that opel was leasing to build the gts  the 0000 series continued in 0000 with minor body differences  in 0000 the manta 0000 sedan also called the ascona and the wagon were available with bosch electronic fuel injection  these cars also had larger brakes and wider wheels  these cars were starting to compete with the 0000 buick century low price leader of the time and were the last opels imported into the us  from 0000 to 0000 cars that sported buickopel badges were still sold by the buick dealers but were rebadged isuzu imarks  the idea was to call them opels instead of changing the dealers neon signs  various models of the 00series cars dominated the showroom stock racing of the 00s in their class and were known as serious 0000competition  parts are still available from a number of sources  i still have a 00 manta and two 00 sedans and all the trick parts i could collect in 00 years   john kennedy                     uunetopeljohnk second source inc              johnksecondsourcecom  annapolis md

  mail bounced so  i am in the process of buying a new auto  i havent decided yet whether i should sell my current car myself or trade it in as part of the new auto purchase  traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it  yourself if you dont mind that extra hassle  having a tradein on a purchase just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing  i know that the blue book value for the car is 0000  i assume this is retail bluebook  there are two bluebook prices one for retail and one for wholesale  you really want the retail price if you can  get it  the blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage and extras on your particular car  you should look all this stuff up yourself also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country that may not apply in your area  for example blue book prices are low for california  a better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is to call around and see what its selling for if any used lots have one or looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices  it  might be more time efficient to take a small loss rather than hold out for 0 months for the best price  an acquaintence has offered to give me blue book value for the car  i dont know what you mean by an acquaintance but i would make darn sure that i was paid that is cashiers check in full before delivery  theres a real temptation when selling to a pseudofriend to be more accomodating than you should  make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying in full at the start with a cashiers check or cash then i would go elsewhere  rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook  thats probably a safer approach than selling to a private party      alan                         mountain dew and doughnuts    ameselroyalan           because breakfast is the most important meal    alanelroyjplnasagov      of the day  
   im considering switching to geico insurance but have heard that  they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  i was  worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  i have  also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident    im interestend in determining whether or not these things are true  has anyone out there with geico made a claim  id be interested in  hearing whether or not you were satisfied with the service and whether  you then had trouble renewing your policy    im also interested in any good or bad stories about liberty mutual or  state farm    stay away from geico   a recent car  driver issue has an article about geico giving free  laser guns to police departments to increase theyre speed limit  enforcement  the article also said that if you get a speeding ticket  your premium will increase dramatically based on how much over the  limit you were  if i remember correctly at more than 00 over  youll get something like a 00 increase    if you have a radar detector you will be denied coverage or dropped  immediately    one accident claim and you will be dropped  after many years with geico my father who had 0 tickets and had made  0 claims had an accident and filed an 000 claim  he was dropped   immediately  since then he has been with state farm for years with  no complaints   i have been with state farm for about 00 years  no complaints    travis

  could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients ie cd mentioned in magazines  i understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but what does this mean in the real world  is there a way to calculate new top speedsassuming the car is not rev limited at top speed or mileage benefits if a identical car had the cd reduced from 00 to 00       i dont remember the formulas off hand as it has been awhile since i took aerodynamics and havent used the stuff since  the cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and fuel consumption when the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater than what the vehicles engine can overcome it has reached its top speed autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance since drag opposes the vehicles motion the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel anyway since the geometery of an auto is rather complex the dragpressure coeffiecentetc is either found experimentaly or using a numerical method  anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is              cd  dq0r         where d is the drag force q the flow velocity and r is the radius of the clyinder    to get a rough very rough estimate you can set r at 00 the cars width q at the cars speed and knowing the cd find the drag force that the car would need to overcome         bp

  paul hovnanian wrote    based on my experience with a 00 fj00  the hardtop jeepstyle model  i   would definitely give a new model consideration if i were in the market the  older models are very well built unless toyota lost its mind i would  assume until  proven otherwise that the newer models have inherited some  if not all of the qualities of their ancestors    two major differences in the running gear that im aware of need study  my 00 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have  independant front suspension the solid axle is theoretically stronger and   the new cruisers do not have independent suspension in the front  they still run a straight axle but with coils  the 0runner is the one with independent front  the cruisers have incredible wheel travel with this system    more reliable than the newer model but only experience will tell the  independant front suspension is no doubt a compromise made to satisfy  the typical user who will never need a real utility vehicle the second  difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models im  not sure but i think tioyota went to a fulltime 0wd or allwheel drive  system the older landcruisers have a lockup type both have their  advantages and disadvantages   the 00up cruiser does have full time 0wd but the center diff locks in low range  my brother has a 00 and is an incredibly sturdy vehicle which has done all the 0 trails in moab without a tow  the 00 and later is even better with the bigger engine and locking diffs   jim chott                            00 toyota 0wd pickup rzaa00emailspsmotcom             00 lemans sport convertible tempe arizona

   in a previous article gwmspl0splloralcom gary w mahan says  could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients ie cd mentioned in magazines  i understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but what does this mean in the real world  is there a way to calculate new top speedsassuming the car is not rev limited at top speed or mileage benefits if a identical car had the cd reduced from 00 to 00  its pretty complex and cd isnt the whole story either  cd for cars is usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car  so a large car with a good cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a poorer cd   to calculate drag use this formula  d  00  rho  v0  cd  s  where d is the drag force lbs rho is the local air density slugsft0 v is the velocity fts and s is the frontal area ft0  note that the pieces called 00  rho  v0 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure a fancy aero term for air pressure or force   note that power is  p  f  v  where p is power lbffts f is the force drag in this case lbf and v is velocity fts   note that if you put the whole equation into one by substituting d for force you get a velocity cubed term  thats why huge increases in power result in little increases in speed  ditto for decreases in cd   so if you have a 000 mph car and reduce cd from 00 to 00 your new top speed is  sound of trumpet fanfare  000 mph  sorry to dissappoint     al bowers  dod 000  alfa  ducati  hobie  kottke  blad  iaido  nasa well goodness sakesdont you know that girls cant play guitar                                              mary chapincarpenter

    derek    there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights  will come back on after 00 weeks the tool is in fact illegal in europe   atleast it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a   used bmw and a few weeks later all the lights come on other than that i know   of no other tool anyone else     about changing oil every 00000 miles thats ok on newer audis they   only require it after every 00000 miles i am talking about an oil change  just a query do you drive your car very very carefully like no sudden   acceleration etc if yeah then the 00000 m oil change seems quite reasonable  but if you drive kinda fast id get a bit up tight abot that 00000 thingy    a point to note just because the first light came on at 0k doesnt mean  all the others will come on every 0k too    shaz shaz  hmm but the service indicators that i have works this way   there are 0 green0 yellow 0 red indicators   initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start   your car the computer will actually sense how you drive your car and   as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and   then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go   on and you should get service when by the time green indicators are off      after service the mechanicor you will reset the service indicators and the   computer starts counting again  so i expect to have a toolor a procedure to reset it so the green lights will  come on and the yellow and red lights will go off  i wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the indicator  its the first european car i have and changing oil at 00000 miles is a  surprise to me and its a big plus  but i wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time i thought its the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil  any bmw owner on the net response welcomed  ps  my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a bmw  derek

  i prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be  i believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive  automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy more time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrating on the road  the manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something granted it isnt a large movement  plus driving should be fun  driving a manual is fun driving an automatic is a chore in the case of shift speed automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick  if i was racing id want and automatic  for normal driving go with the manual  
   here is a press release from the national crime prevention council    the campaign urges drivers to remember to lock up roll up and look around     lock car doors immediately after entering or leaving the car     roll up windows as far as possible and     look around and be alert to avoid situations that are        suspicious         that reminds me of a blurb in the police blotter in my school paper along the lines of police were called because so and so reported there were suspicious people hangning around the business building  turns out it was two black men leaving the building after doing homework late one night  
  just stopped putting money into it  i must have put at least 00000000 worth of repairs over its lifetime  i am sorry but lee iacocca can bite me  bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things area the part about spending 00000000 on repairs reminds me of an article i read in a magazine comparing the 0 year ownership costs of a toyota camry and a ford taurus or something like that  the result which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period  that was their argument to prove that you dont go wrong buying the ford taurus over the camry  now if i remember correctly the camry costs about 0000 or so more in initial costs  essentially it means that you spend about 0000 extra on repairs on the taurus  that is ridiculous  every time your car needs repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other things i would much rather spend 0000 more in initial costs than spend 0000 more in repair costs   0      cut here for signature       0 balaji ramanathan                     institute of transportation studies          i dont believe in luck university of california irvine                  i rely on it

   you know im a ford fan i must say so im looking forward to the next  mustang  i have faith that it will be a fine product more desireable  than the camaro is now  you know thats mho      truethats your opinion    they beat ford to the market with the camarofirebird but really only  in words  production of these vehicles will be limited until the  end of the year keeping selling prices above msrp for the most part  since there are so many twitching camaro fans out there  i wouldnt  press ford to hurry the mustang since the final wait could be worth it  besides no bowtie fanatic is gonna buy the mustang anyway    true again i wouldnt take a free mustanghonest    the next mustang will be fords highest profile car  it attracts  way more attention than the camarofirebird because its heritage  is more embedded in the general public  dont lie to yourself and  believe ford will forfeit that    fyi they already did  too bad that the current mustang cant even compete with the new  camaro without using an active imagination  right now few cars can compare with the 00 camaro think about it  00000 for a car that will out perform all but a few exotics  if you are now swearing at me look at the statsthey dont lie   there are no comparable cars in its class certinaly not for its price      you knowintelligent critical spews like the mustang bites man    some of you are already beginning  i predict that the mustang and camaro  will be comparable performers as usual    i also agree this subject is one that will never be setteled  except maybe at the  track     unless the ford gets the 00v 000hp romeo  you dont seriously believe  that it was designed for the mark viii only do you    hey can you imagine the potential of a modified lt0  folks in a few years we will surpass the levels of performance   achieved in the late 00s thats scary  you ford vs chevy people must live in the planet of detroit or droid  like they say in the airforce with enough horsepower anything will fly  i can put a 00valve v0 with twin garret0s on yugo and get 00sec qm thats useless  its still a yugo that will loose any race on a track or on the street  have you detroit beings compared the ultralongthrow stick shifts of the 00 with the 00 mr0 turbo or 00 rx0 i ll buy it in 0 mos   or the torsen differential of the rx0 compared to the differential of  the 00 that sounds in every hairpin turn   and bythe way 00 and camaro both have drums on the rear breaks  hello  this is the 00 s   vlasis theodore software engineer  just say no to signatures  
  wrote    hi   ive been seeing all these articles about changing  brake fluid and i am wondering if this is really necessary  i have an 00 toyota corolla sr0 with 00000 and i am in the  process of doing preventative maintenance and i was  wondering if this was something that i should add to  my list of things to do  any information would be greatly appreciated i really  love this car and would like to keep it for as long as   possible    thanx    lisa    sign me only a manual will do  amplifying on jeff gosss answer the absorbed water will rust your brakelines and master cylinder and calipers and you could suddenly lose all your brake fluid

   hello auto enthusiasts    i recently had more car mangled broken into and decided to  get an alarm installed  its a viper 000 and has a shock  sensor sensors for each door ignition cutoff and automatic  door locks  i have this same alarm installed in my syclone  it works great  the shock sensor is very sensitive but much more practical than the motion sensor i have on my other car  it doesnt trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind but any kind of shock sets it off  even kicking the tire sets it off  it works great     what worries me is the hood and hatch  if someone could pry   them up gently enough then they could bypass the alarm  the shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it  you can adjust it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without setting off the alarm  although i know that you cannot pop the hood on the syclone without setting off my alarm now and yet i have had zero none false alarms with this system  the alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has been activated in your absence  i have been able to trace every alarm to its cause and it was not a false alarm    im also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl  underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm   i guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle  my syclone is so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this  there are supplemental power supplies you can put on with this viper alarm but i dont have one  i really think that if someone wants my car that bad the alarm wont keep them from it even with a supplemental power supply   viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that  supposedly detects people approcahing the car   this is primarily for convertibles  i have a convertible and have looked at this feature in detail  alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want to get one of these  it has zones in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm it shuts down the zone or rather pulls it in tighter i dont see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you leave the top down on  avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package  it talks to people as they walk by  i saw one installed on a lotus esprit  the kids would taunt it seeing how close they could get before it warned them to get back  the owner finally disabled it which defeats the purpose in my mind    im interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems  and about the viper in general   i am real happy with my viper  one other feature i really like is you can tune it to your preferences  you can have it arm passively or not  you can disable the chirp for armingdisarming  you can have it lockunlock the doors when the alarm is armeddisarmed    i like these features  i hate the chirp when the alarm armsdisarms so mine flashes the lights only  i like the door lock feature although i have to be careful to take my keys with me because it doesnt know if you have left your keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors  but if you are meticulous about taking your keys with you it takes care of the rest  the car is an 00 ford probe gt that used to be in great shape      ron garnett    i looked seriously at the alpine system too  it is a real nice system but more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor  the shock sensor is betterand the viper shock sensor is better 0 cycle than the optional alpine one imho  i think the viper gives you a lot of good value for the money  but it isnt absolutely tamperproof  no system is  except maybe the one that james bond had on his lotus in for your eyes only  anyone know where we can get one of those installed  maybe that was what they had in the van in the world trade center huh   merrill   
   i tried the autofom stuff on my 0000 saturn sc and was so disappointed with it that i returned it for a refund  i polished the car for 0 hours and couldnt remove the swirl marksthin film that was all over the finish  it also attracted more dirt than without the stuff  
   before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm lets go on the assumption that one is desired  the question then remains which one  ive owned a hornet and was satisfied but not enough to get another for my new car  the alpine has been highly recommended but what about clifford and vses derringer 0  any others  i want all of the standard stuff door lock interface starter kill light flash led valet mode passiveactive shockmotion sensor etc  thanks for the advice

  as a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the us while  here in europe they are rare just wondering  primarily milage  gas is much more expensive so people are very concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer  this along with narrow old cities also results in smaller cars with smaller engines  these engines usually dont have the torque to mesh well with an automatic  so having engines that dont work well with autos and a great concern for milage the usual eurocar has a manual  note that not many big benzes come with manuals  if youve got the money for the car youve got the money for the gas and the engine to drive through the slushbox  as automatics become more efficient the bigotry is probably reduced  still everyone knows how to drive a manual and cars are cheaper with one and it saves a little expensive fuel  so there arent compelling reasons to go automatic  db     
  this whole discussion is just a religous war  id rather have a 00 rx0 than the mustang 00l for 0 times the price  thats how you explain porsches selling  some folks would rather have the stang  shrug  sean   test signature  
   v00 anyone anyone heard of a cizata v00t  its mainly sold in the middle  east where they dont have as strict a legislation as in the usa and ec  
  thanx craig in addition to craigs coments  and to clear up any  further confusion the 000sx of usa was reffered to as a silvia turbo in the uk performance figures of uk 000sx are  000 00s vmax 000mph shaz  oh one more q you know that new prelude vtec well is there an auto version in the usa ive heard of them in japan but not uk also do you guys get  auto miatas  
  since were on the subject of brakes does anyone know why a 0wd vauxhall opel disengages drive to the rear wheels when the brakes are applied vauxhall boast about how the car is more stable in fwd mode during braking than in 0wd mode how is this so  shaz  
   yeah diesels are cleaner than petrol powered cars they even have catalysts  fitted to disels now oh and citroen have even launched the first sports  diesel car in the world which is probably true if you assume if its for  production purposes mercbenz had a prototype which runs on diesel back in  around 0000 it did  and read this  000 mph shaz  
  in the ec the corrado vr0 is rated as best handling car this side of a  000 as it goes i just read an article in autocar  motor comparing the  vr0 to a ford probe later to be launched in the uk the vr0 is more powerful even more so coz its 00 instead of 00 in the ec and more fun to drive etc etc but the probe has a slightly smoother engine thanx mazda mx0  they sum it up as both cars are fast  the vr0 is a bit more exhilirating to  drive but only if youre prepared to work harder  shaz

  hi would someone like to post a comparative analysis quantitative measures hp etc and more so the qualitative feel of how they compare for the driving feel handling noise responsiveness etc for the saab 0000000s and the bmw 00 series any comments on just comparing the 000 with the 0000 re handling  i take it that the saabs and bmws are comparable for reliability and all thatwould be nice if flaming wars could be avoided and folks just post their experiences   i had a 00 saab 000 turbo and now have a 00 bmw 000is  there is no comparison for handling reliability or overall quality of engineering the bmw wins hands down after 0 years i was sick and tired of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the saab the 0year old bmw is still as sweet as it was new  but i see you are posting from western ma bmws suck in the snow i have aggressive snows plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back and i still try to avoid driving in the snow i happily took the saab through blizzard conditions without a worry i would say this is the single design flaw in the bmw     jonathan edwardsedwardsintranetcom intranet inc0000000000

  from article 0000apr0000000000000ultbiscritedu by adn0000ritvaxiscritedu  i have a pair of sport seats from 00 mr0 for sale blueblack  as the owner of an mr0 and having several friends who own them i am very uncomfortable when i see an ad like this  i have known several people who have lost the seats from their mr0 in the middle of the night to support the celica retrofit trade  and the  insurance companies have been very miserable to deal with in all cases    when these seats are seen for sale they are most often stolen so it would be nice to see a statement saying where they came from that would at least help to soothe the reflexive fear that someone is making a buck at someone elses expense  ill give this seller the benefit of the doubt but people should be aware the the vast majority of mr0 seats on the marketespecially those that are in celicasare stolen   lee   btw  they are incredible seats  so if its legit go for it     i am the original owner of the seats and the original poster  i take very serious offence in your statement  i see a lot of computers advertized on the net and my friend just had been releived of his machine  all the netcomputer ads are for stolen computers where did you learn logic  as for the seats they were replaced by a much harder literally celica gts seats due to my back problem that is why i had to reuse the mr0 brackets and thats why the mr0 seats i sell are attached to celica brackets  please in the future think before you make allegations like the above it hurts mikes

  none of the configurations are perfectly inherently balanced which is what i was talking about  balance shafts and mass on either ends of the cranks can eliminate these forcesmoments which is something i also pointed out  and didnt you also say that it was easier to add masses than to add balance shafts  the sad truth is that some makers dont bother to put balance shafts on their big shaky 0s  the three cranks i refer to            i                                                        i                   0 0      i0                                            evenfiring 000 deg    0          0           k          0     0              j          fp0                                       mp0                                         0 0      fs0rlzcos0t                                                  ms0                                          j                                                        j                   0 0      flat0                                          evenfiring 000 deg  k   0          0                         0     0                    i    fp0                                       mp0                                         0 0      fs0           a  crank spacing                      ms0arlzcos0t                   j                                        j                0   0                                                           0 0      flat0                                             evenfiring 000 deg        k                                                                    i    fp0                                            mp0azcost                                         0 0      fs0                0   0                             ms0   how about     0 0                                                        0     0  if this is ridiculous kindly explain why its been more than 00 years since i studied this stuff    flat 0s and i0s both have the potential to be nearly vibration free  because subaru does that has nothing to do with i0s in general or porsche  i think subaru somehow connecting themselves to porsche is an absurdity and im not a porsche fan  big wing dings  these configurations overhead cams etc etc etc have been around for nearly 000 years   the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles for the orthodox inline 0 they are using a horizontally opposed 0 which is unique in that market segment  and porsche also uses a flat six in their 000 so whats the problem  i dont see any claim that their engine is as good as a porsches they are simply pointing out that they use the same configuration as a porsche if you want to nitpick ad campaigns i think there are far more blatant excesses than this   eliot

  wratunisqluucp wharfie writes my car was recently destroyed in a hail storm   i fully expected to get jerked around by the insurance company i wasnt the only one who had hail damage  state farm opened its claim centers on evenings and weekends and flew down additional adjusters from dallas  i have no experience with state farm but i think its important to differentiate your experience from a typical accident  hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner and also tends to be well publicized in the media so its to the ins cos benefit to respond promptly and helpfully  damage like this doesnt imply anything about the likelihood of future claims unless you live in an area that gets frequent damaging hail storms so theres no reason for them to stop covering you thats a lot different from atfault accidents or theftrelated claims which may be more indicative of claim patterns

  i just have got to remind all of you that this is it  yes thats right somtime this fall ford the granddaddy of cars will be introducing an allnew megacool waytoofastforaccorddrivers mustang  its supposed to be 000 streamlined looking similar to the mach iii concept car ford came out with around january  i cant wait  anyone out there hear anything about it recently   if everything ive read is correct ford is doing nothing but re skinning the existing mustang with minor suspension modifications and the pictures ive seen indicate they didnt do a very good job of it    the new mustang is nothing but a recycle of a 00 year old car  jeff     
  dchanciscocom derek chan writes    in article 0000apr000000000000westminsteracuk jkjecwestminsteracuk shazad barlas writes   derek      there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights   will come back on after 00 weeks the tool is in fact illegal in europe    atleast it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a    used bmw and a few weeks later all the lights come on other than that i know    of no other tool anyone else      shaz    hmm but the service indicators that i have works this way    there are 0 green0 yellow 0 red indicators    initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start    your car the computer will actually sense how you drive your car and    as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and    then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go    on and you should get service when by the time green indicators are off        after service the mechanicor you will reset the service indicators and the    computer starts counting again    so i expect to have a toolor a procedure to reset it so the green lights will   come on and the yellow and red lights will go off    i wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the  indicator    its the first european car i have and changing oil at 00000 miles is a   surprise to me and its a big plus  but i wonder how that could happen  since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time i thought its the oil and  not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil    any bmw owner on the net response welcomed    ps  my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a bmw    derek   there is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the bimmer service lights it will cost you 00 from a mailorder and buying one far outweighs the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try di it yourself  you wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset why is reseting so important the only reason for doing it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you  forget this in european cars you only need to change the oil every 00000 crap anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape and extending its life will change it every 0000 inc filter dont wait for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car  i bought a bmw about 0 months ago it had 0 green lights on i have changed the oil every 0000 completly flushed brake fliud changed all filtersoil air and fuel changed transmission and drive oils and done almost all of the other things req for service 0 and a service 0 after nearly 0000 miles i am still on 0 green lights after a winter in burlington and it is snowing today that is not bad  good luck    blair    blair e robertson             a new zealander in vermont university of vermont             posting his own ideas medical research facilty smooth muscle ion channel group colchester  vermont 000000000 email blairnorthpolemeduvmedu telephone 000 0000000

   does anybody have any information on the second generation broncos im not talking about bronco iis im referring to the broncos that began production in 0000 based on the f000 chassis i believe  ahh broncos  well personally i have a 00  the blue book is just a hair over 0 grand  i bought it for 0000 and then bought new tires 000 front end rebuild 000 carb rebuild 000  then i did the unthinkable and blew the engine not bronco specific unmaintained engine with 000000 0000 more bucks there now it is in nice condition well after new seats out of a tbird radio 0 amps speakers alarm well the radio and amps were  free and i bought the speakers used for 00 bucks and the other speakers i took out of my old jeep sell a jeep for a bronco you might ask but it was a wagoneer  its a lovely specimen solid front and rear axels ford 0 and a dana 00 up front  watch the rear axel wrap i  busted off my ubolts once i added traction shocks after that and  havent had a problem since  also the bottom of the doors tend to  rot bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones that might be in your budget  the post 00 broncos have that sickly ttb front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were as the 0000 have nice big cast iron longer radius armsie more prspective wheel travel  the only rust i have is on my doors and a few dings in the sheet metal  i dont know when the removeable tops were discontinued but they are fun  i just ordered a full convertable top for 000 for minecredit card  dont ever break the window if you have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over 000 bucks to replace  my bronco also does pretty good offroad i havent bottomed out my suspension yet and have crossed over 0 foot deep of water with no problems handles rocks like a charm too one problem is it is wide and you sometimes cant follow a cj or a toyota between two rocks or trees and your grandmother will have a hard time getting up into it  bob  
    he was as smooth as silk it was the most amazing shifting demonstration ive ever seen having said all that i  still dont know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without a clutch why do it  ego trip    mark walker my old man always said mwalkerchamaeeceunmedutoo much is just right 0000000000  home 0000000 guess that applies to my preferences albuquerque nm in performance cars  
  i have they showed the foot cam and telemetry for rusty wallace shifting at at lanta last year and he never touched the clutch except very slightly when down shifting  000 hp is pretty powerful to me  i doubt his trans uses standard syncros  there are several mechanisms for coupling a gear with the transmission output shaft some of which are fine for racing and unsuitable for street use    mark walker my old man always said mwalkerchamaeeceunmedutoo much is just right 0000000000  home 0000000 guess that applies to my preferences albuquerque nm in performance cars

   i dont think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem  unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight  fluid  follow the manufacturers recommended oil weight  some of the  cars i have had all standard transmissions 0 or 0 speeds recommend  changing the transmission fluid at 00000 miles under normal driving  conditions  ive gone 000000 without changing the transmission oil and  had to replace the transmission bearings my older cars used 00 weight  oil whereas my 00 honda uses 0000 motor oil or maybe 00 weight  
  i agree with jeffs reply  ive never changed the brake fluid except when having a brake job which is usually at around 00000 miles alot of freeway driving  however i will start to do this as preventative maintenance on my new car  also there are brake system flushing agents that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the system it can cause problems so its been recommended not to use them unless you are 000 certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent  just for your info i was quoted a price of labor0000 and fluid000 for flushing the brake system this in conjunction with a break job so i dont know if it was more without the brake job this is in the sf bay area  
  hi javier how are things at corp my old stomping ground was clevel vibration when applying the brakes can be caused on disc brakes at least by warped rotors when the brakes are applied there results uneven pressure on the rotor  turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning ie within spec there could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free  
  the villagerquest seem like the best of the cravanvoyager copies to come along since the mazda mpv  the nissan maxima engine paired with the maxima 0 speed auto trans should be an excellent drive train and the rest of the vehicle seems well engineered  only the price is controversial  hmm  the last time i checked villagerquest does not have a maxima engine and is very much under powered for its weight  
  didnt the saab sonnett have a v0 i recall someone telling that it was something like 00 of a ford 000  not only the sonett correct spelling but the 00 wagon and 00 sedan used a 0000 cc or 0000 cc v0 from ford of germany  this particular motor had a 00 degree vee angle a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust ports  this motor was later stretched into the v0 commonly seen in the capri  the v0 could make pretty reasonable power for its size  but in the saab it made too much torque for the transmission which had been designed for a 0cylinder 0stroke    chuck fry former sonett iii owner       chuck fry  chuckofreudarcnasagov  this space for rent   i alone bear responsibility for the claptrap above  
   ok so in my ongoing search for a sport utility heres the latest   toyota 0runner   small small small small the interior of this vehical is impossible for a large person too bad it would have been the winner otherwise  nissan pathfinder  very low ceiling my head hit the roof fun on bumps no also has a cheaplooking interior  isuzu trooper  class act this is a really really nice vehical very comfortable handled ok has really cool grab handles everywhere but its huge and the engine is a bit too small for its bulk also the manual shift is  weird and kind of awkward id buy this if it were 0k cheaper or 00 shorter but at this size and for this price no i kept picturing trying to  park in in san francisco no thanks   chevy blazer  cheap looking small not as small as the toyota and nissan but still  too small  ford explorer  this is no sports car and its certainly not for the serious off roader but its big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the trooper its engine has plenty of power for everyday driving though it would be nice if it had a bit more the automatic tranny is pretty nice head and shoulders above my 00 mazda mpv the steering is not as tight as id like but its acceptable the two door has easytoenter back seats easier to get into in fact than the drivers seat of the 0runner and with a 00 shorter wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny yes im a manual  shift biggot i admit it its the one im thinking of buying    so that said is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it anyone had any major problems heard any horror stories   also any reason to buy the ford over the mazda navajo both being essentially the same vehical   thanks   karl        karl elvis macraesoftware release supportcisco systems   kmacciscocom or batmanciscocom     0000000000   dod 0000  fj0000          shovels and rakes and implements of destruction arlo guthrie

   before you go in find out the invoice prices of the car add a reasonable   profit for the dealer 000000 offer them that price and stick to   it  whoa  watch your terminology  dealer invoice is not dealer cost youll hear lots of ads screaming two dollars over dealer invoice sounds like a real deal huh  no  you know what the dealer invoice also called factory invoice is  its a piece of paper with numbers on it that the factory sends the dealer  what do the numbers signify  absolutely nothing  its a marketing gimmick that the salesman can wave in your face to impress you  note that nowhere on the invoice does it claim to be the real price of the car and most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast low voice saying something like invoice may not reflect actual dealer cost  actually i guarantee it does not reflect actual dealer cost  also the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that you want  haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of dealer prep and protection package ie a few squirts of paint and fabric protectant  while youre at it ask the salesman to toss in a thing or two that doesnt cost him any cash  my  wife and i got a joyride in a twinturbo mitsubishi 0000gt when we bought our mitsubishi minivan

  in article  chuckeosncsuedu chuck kesler writes jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says  can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc  ive found mine 00 probe gt to do quite well    window problem deleted artical has been trimmed  i have had my probe looked at twice by my local dealer where i purchased the car  the first time they made this problem worse  the second time after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my fordprobe mailing list they said they didnt know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and made it much better  however it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough roads and still squeals when i openclose the window in wet weather anyone elsess do this  ive not had any of the air or leakage problems that have been reported but do get the squeal that bill describes  i live in seattle so the wet weather may be a factor  ford only gives 0 key with the car  cmon ford spend an extra few pennies  if i recall correctly i got two keys  horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in  center personal preference  youvegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep buttons are terrible  this is true  im wondering if this may be a safety concern  ie if people pound on the place where the airbag lives  speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns  no opinion  transmission the 0 speed is a must  i have always been a 0speed guy  almost every car ive ever owned has been a 0speed  because i got a good deal on this car with the 0000 miles i knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic  but it is a pretty hightech automatic  it is a fully electronicaly controlled 0speed with  the 0 speed is much more fun  we opted for the automatic for a number of reasons but its still fun and in some ways more practical  no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still  ditto  shakes and rattles has been my main gripe  ive gotten them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older  i too would suspect that this may be true  tires 00000vr00 goodyear eagles 00 left hoping for 00k   very very very well  it sticks to the road like glue even on a rough surface  yes  interior is very very nice too  very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound  definitely  fordmazda did a very very nice job on this one  the car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it  ditto  yes this cars stiff suspension isnt for everyone  i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car id strongly suggest looking into the mx0  agree check it out  i dont mind it but would say that if it was much  stiffer it might be a problem  how about the 00 r0 rx0 for suspension   well i wouldnt encourage passengercarrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash  as mentioned in the consumer reports writeups consider the back seat as a parcel shelf  no biggie to me though if it had been id not have bought the car  but its definitely not a family car  true    ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine  i havent heard about this one  i know that some of the very early probes 00 and maybe 00 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which  ive had this problem and read about it  or at least i assume the one i had was the one i read about   in any case what happened was the weld between the muffler and the pipe feeding it ok so im not a mechanic broke  in my case the dealer welded it ordered replacement parts and put them on when they got them  i suspect this is some sort of 0 design flaw or 0 production flaw  in any case i have an earlier model and would expect it to be worked out on newer ones  in any case it is a warrantee repair  or they get the keys back  from what ive heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with  the probe and probably mx0 when they first went into production but  i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point  thats almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though  i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm  but i seriously feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well  i second this  there seems to be some things that slipped through but the car seems very sound  while not perfection what is you get an awful lot for your money    bill heiser    heiseracsbuedu heiserworldstdcom                boston university boston ma     btw bill has a probe mailing list  you might want to subscribe to it if  you are interested in more detail  try requestfordprobeworldstdcom did i get that right  never can remember if the request goes on the front or the back        john navitskyjohnneskimocom  exercise a right today

   let me explain why i feel the bogey counter feature is a gimmick radar waves bounce off objects especially metal  that is how radar speed measurement works  a high frequency microwave x band approx 00 ghz and k is approx 00 ghz is sent out and reflected back to the antenna off of an automobile or other objects  if an object is moving a doppler shift about 00 hz per mph on x band occurs is measured and converted to miles per hour  these waves bounce all over the place and they can reflect many times and go in many directions  from what i understand the valentine0 can only tell if these microwaves are coming from the front rear or both  there are only two antennas  if they are coming from both this in interpreted as a side bogey  bogey counts are determined as sources by their relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the same source  im certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis on which to make this argument but dont you answer your own question  is the reflected signal shifted at all from the act of being reflected  if so wouldnt it then be easy for the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct sources  here is the problem  since the microwaves reflect how does the unit tell if it is a source or a reflection  take a valentine0 and drive to the local grocery store that uses an xband radar door opener  you can tell by the small black box above the door pointed down at about a 00 degree angle and your detector going off when it gets near  the valentine0 will count 0 or 0 bogeys from all directions front rear and sides it doesnt say which side  the count changes as cars drive by and reflections change  is there 0 or 0 sources  not at the store i go to  as i drive around with a standard detector i can only find one source and that is the door opener for the front door  troy wecker troysequentcom sequent computer systems beaverton or   david w hwang md                      davidganglionannarbormius

   writes i looked at that bimmer yesterday its an 00 has about 00kmi according to owner odometer stopped working at 00kmi drivess well sounds good body is ok he wants 0000 i liked the car despite its auto tranny but my wife will be a primary driver on this one and she wants auto the radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn  the ac seems to have a leak the sunroof is sticky but operational odometer does not work as mentioned before idle is a bit bouncy going from 000rpm to 0000rpm wipers are slow thats teh gripes the owner says that he changed radiator alternator rotors and calipers exhaust the biggest problem is that the owner is a shifty sob telling strange stories i hate that i would never buy from a persom like that except how often you see a descent 000i for that amount of money he also said that although i could bring a mechanicin he wouldnt let me check the car by taking  it to a garage suspicious and who knows what milage is on it so let me know what to check for given theres practically no rust i know there was an article on 000i in rd a few years back anybody remembers what issue mikes  dont buy it  all of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches later on  also it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably know bmws are not cheap to fix either  the owner sounds like a shady character just trying to take advantage of someone sure  0000 sounds good but you should calculate how much the repairs will be it sounds like you would have to sink in at least  0000 to get everything fixed if not more also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned who knows how many miles are on it and how it was driven  sure people tell you bmws hold up but you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear for all you know it could have 000000 miles on it  the thing you have to remember is that this isnt the last 000i around either just wait and keep shopping for around  00000000 you can probably find one that is better needs less repair and has legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering take it from a guy who has been taken a couple of times good luck al himsl

  hi i was looking for some helpful advice im a university student with about 0000 to spend and im looking for a  used car does anyone have any useful advice they could offer to a first time buyer im not looking for anything sporty just something functional  and reliable less maintenance costs anybody have any ideas on what models  might suit me  thanks  sanjai   
  the part about spending 00000000 on repairs reminds me of an article i read in a magazine comparing the 0 year ownership costs of a toyota camry and a ford taurus or something like that  the result which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period  that was their argument to prove that you dont go wrong buying the ford taurus over the camry  now if i remember correctly the camry costs about 0000 or so more in initial costs  essentially it means that you spend about 0000 extra on repairs on the taurus  that is ridiculous  every time your car needs repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other things i would much rather spend 0000 more in initial costs than spend 0000 more in repair costs  did you account for depreciation  i seriously doubt that a taurus would rack up an extra 0000 in repair costs over 0 years  teddy

   re extended ka bands  i recently bought a 0 band detector  you guys must all think im nuts right  well i did a little research into ka usage in this area and found out that ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states  heres how i found out   a cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesnt even know    what ka is  hes heard of k which is what they use here and i   explained that ka is used for photo radar etc he then said yeah   ka stands for k automatic duuhh  he then went on to say that   plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high   tech were concerned but he didnt know too much   my 0 year old 0 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps   even the real sneaky ones   when i called the escort shop they confirmed that ka is not used here   or in surrounding states  they did claim that laser was being used   a lot here which i was quite skeptical of  so in the end instead of spending a lot of money andor waiting months for a state of the art detector i got a low priced high performance 0 band escort 0000  incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in x and k band detection  i know that escort has been surpassed by other brands lately but ive never fully relied on a detector and i was convinced that the escorts would be at least quite good which was good enough for me and my wallet   eliot

     one more way which works in manual trans cars ive driven and it is my personal favorite the other suggestions above are great but try this one too     while pushing the shifter gently towards reverse let the clutch out slowly right to the friction point and the shifter will be pulled into position if you do it right the car wont jump backward nor will the gears grind you will just glide back   sam  i can vouch for this method in my 0000 sho  this is the only sure way of  putting in the reverse without any problem every time  vikas sontakkedigital equipment corporation maynard ma internetsontakkehelixenetdeccom     uucpdecvaxucbvaxallegradecwrlhelixenetsontakke sontakkehelixenetdecwrldeccom

   ive owned a saturn for and year and a half and didnt have the extended warranty but just traded it in for a 0000 for reasons that i wont mention unless someone wants to know  i opted for the 0 year00000 mile extended with 00 deductible  its sorta like buying health insurance  you could say that youre not sick now and havent been sick for a while but you cant guarantee that you wont be sick tomorrow  a little money invested today is better than being sick tomorrow and now being able to pay for it or having to pay a lot more tomorrow than you can today  justify all you want  extended warranties are a ripoff high profit item for the dealer  and you didnt buy 0yr00k you get 0yr00k free so what you bought is 0yr00k  and you still have to pay 00 every time you use this  great warranty  better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs ifwhen you need it  considering that your last car was only 00 years old are you sure you will even keep this new one past its free warranty period btw typical profit on extended warranties is around 00  thats right only 00 of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future repairs that the group of extendedwarrantypeople collect

  well the opel deal fell through  now im looking at a datsun 000z for sale in our local buysell  any previous owners have any experience with these cars  besides looking for rustgood compressionlow miles and all the other usual car things one looks for is there anything special about these cars that i should watch out for  how about things like handlingperformancemileageetc  these cars look hot to my eyes at least and bear more than a passing resemblance to the aston martin db0 zagatosp which has to be one of the most beatiful cars ever made  what is the difference between 000z 000z 000z  the 000zx is rather  unappealing imho but the other cars are decent thanks again darren gibbons gibbonsasfuca   
  with spring upon us its time to start waxing again  i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions about waxes and polishes  i know carnuba wax is often  recommended on the net but i was wondering about the colored waxes to cover up some minor scratches  do the colored waxes give on overall good quality shine are they good for the paint or clear coat  what about liquid glass is it a clear polish which dries clear thus filling scratches  is it good for the paintclear coat  please post with both good and bad experiences  and hey lets name names  brands here     all gimmicks  stick with plain ol carnauba wax thats nonabrasive eagle 0 meguiars turtle wax and a few others are good examples the colored waxes just color in the scratches so theyre not so  apparent  the better approach is to buff minor scratches completely off with a cleanermild abrasive  never tried liquid glass although i still have this sample they sent me a few years back   aaron     
   carolinafanuiuc cka00000uxacsouiucedu wrote   i have been active in defending saturn lately on the net and would   like to state my full opinion on the subject rather than just reply to others   points      the biggest problem some people seem to be having is that saturn   dealers make 0k on a car  i think most will agree with me that the car is   comparably priced with its competitors that is they arent overpriced    compared to most cars in their class  i dont understand the point of    arguing over whether the dealer makes the 0k or not      i have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is either  the only thing that i can figure out is that people believe that if  they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total outofpocket  expenses for the car while this may be true in some cases i do not  believe that it is generally true i bought a saturn sl in january of 00  at that time based on studying car prices i decided that there was  no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the saturn sure maybe i  could have talked the price for some other car to the saturn price but  my outofpocket expenses wouldnt have been any different whats important  to me is how much money i have left after i buy the car reducing dealer profit  is not the same thing as saving money show me how reducing dealer profit  saves me money and ill believe that its important my experience has  been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money    fred   say you bought your saturn at 00k with a dealer profit of 0k if the dealer profit is 0000 then you would only be paying 00k for the same car  so isnt that saving money  moreover if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by 0000  then their cars will be even better deals  say if the price of a saturn was already 0000 below market average for the class of cars then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be 0000 below market average  it will  0 attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money   0 force the competitors to lower their prices to survive  now not only will saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even  the buyers for other cars will pay less  isnt that saving money    000 doug

  on cochran writes       id like to add the beretta gtz as a car which will kick gsr butt  anyday and its a lot cheaper to boot   i will take this one with a definate grain of salt  performance data shows a   if this poster has some proofother than my friend blew one away last week        want proof  here is some data on acceleration and handling from motor trend apr 00            integra gsr     beretta gtz  000         00             00 00 mile     000000       000000 l acc gs  00             00 slalom       000            000 wrong why dont you look again at motor trends slalom times they are 000 right along with the integra and the car does that with small 00 inch tires that are all weather xgtv0 not to mention that the integra rides alot better than a beretta your acceleartion times also vary magazine to magazine road  track and car driver have the gsr at 00 to 00 for road and track also quarter mile times vary from 000 to 000 you cant tell exactly by the numbers  furthermore the integra will definately outrun the beretta on the high end  car  driver and road  track have the gsr doing 000 to 000 mph and it gets there fast        so the beretta can out handle the integra and it can certainly keep up with it in acceleration  and the beretta probably has a higher top speed due to the horsepower advantage 000000 hptorque for the integra vs 000000 for the beretta you always believe those exact numbers why dont you drive a gsr and see for your self while the gsr has a low 000 torqye its high gearing over a 0000 rpm make up for the difference still wouldnt call it a torque moster though       the biggest advantage would have to be the price  the integra costs 00000 as tested motor trend the gtz costs 00000 as tested  the gtz also has standard nicities and airbag and antilock brakes  an airbag is not available on the integra and lower models do not have abs considering you save almost 0000 dollars for the beretta and the quad0 is a reliable engine it doesnt make sense to get the integra as a performance coupe which is what people have been trying to make it out to be   quad 0 reliable yeah whats your definition of reliable if thats reliable then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect  not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter  balance shaftsthe acura has the engine    wins the reliablity contest hands down you can rev that car all day everyday and youll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else i speak from expierence im not saying the quad 0 is a bad engine but dont highlight reliability when you comparing it to a acura engine  and while the integra costs alot more it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better  and does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time  note this isnt a flame on the gtz or other gm quad 0 products  the berreta is a nice car and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable price not to mention it has an airbag  but to start quoting figures from one source isnt too reliable  read other sources and drive both cars  while i havent driven a gtz i have driven gts and grand ams with quad 0 engines so they are similair

  hello testing    
         my friend brought a subaru svx recently  i had drove it for couples times and i think its a great car esp on snow  however when she took it to a local subaru dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about 00 dollars  the dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour at first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price  so is there any svx owner out there that has the same problem   and if the oil change story is true then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me by the way the car looks great  swd wan

  photo radar and mailed tickets make no sense at all speeding is a moving  violation committed by the operator not the owner the owner may be a  rental agency a dealer a private party or a government agency as long as the owner has no reason to expect the operator will be driving illegally or unsafely the owner cannot be held responsible for what the operator does the car may even have been driven without the owners knowledge or consent  i cant believe a mailed ticket where the driver is not identified would  stand up in court this is obviously a lazy cynical boneheaded fascist  way to extort revenue and has nothing to do with public safety   bk  what do photo radar units look like  also what major us cities use it  jon dunn

  ssaveolecdaccom the devil reincarnate writes  you will be surprised at the number of people who forget their glasses  while driving  and then there are the people who just plain dont get  their eyes checked once a year  as someone who has lousy vision i can see objects at a distance without my glasses however they are quite fuzzy and i may not be able to make out the details but i can certainly tell that something is there     i wont argue too much about anything  i am probably one of those that  think that we cant have enough safety on the roads  i would gladly  sacrifice distractions as you call it than someone having trouble seeing danger earlier  one saved life justifies more than my lifetime of distractions for me     and then there is dawn and dusk  when your eyes have not yet adjusted  to the poor light  and there are those who drive blackgrey cars and  then there is the case where you are driving down a twoway one lane   road and someone is overtaking cars and coming the opposite direction   doesnt see you because your lights are not on or vice versa  at 00mph   that is quite a small reaction time  but of course we are too macho to   think we are invincible and can react faster than that only the poor   sod who you didnt see might not have a normal life ever  i worked out the reaction time in a previous post and its plenty even for an 00 year old grandma as long as speeds are in the 00 mph range or less if you or some other driver is going way faster than that then be careful  as always you are responsible for your driving actions if you pull out to pass and crash into someone for whatever reason its your fault if you cant      problem is that i may just kill the guy i agree that i would be at fault and i will have my license revoked why i might even go to the gas chamber but the fact still remains that the guy is dead  someone died because i was too stingy to put on my lights    see a damn thing then you shouldnt be driving  lights fail fallen trees or rocks dont have lights etc  i maintain that headlight strength      the ratio of the probability of fallen treesrocks on the roads to  oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered  the difference is also working on what we know could happen to what might happen   running lights are not necessary for motorists who drive around 00mph it may be a good idea to force the running or headlights on when you turn your windshield wipers on but only because some people are too stupid to do so if you crash into one of those idiots you have to fight it out in court to show his neglegence if you can even prove it     just out of curiosity how much gasmilage do you loose when you put  your lights on  and how much do you reduce the life of your headlamps  and what is the cost of your headlamps anyway  mileage is certainly reduced but by a very very small amount probably about 000 watts for head and running lights this is an extra 00 horsepower that must be made by the engine it may be that this will cost you around two  gallons a year but times 000 million cars thats a lot of gas    compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by those 000 million cars it is miniscule     whatever  tis a pity i have to share the same roads with a person not concerned with safety  s ssaveolecdaccom   lamp life is measured in hours so if you normally drive in half daylight and half night your lamps will have to be replaced twice as often headlamps only cost about 00us for most halogen lamps  the cost to the individual is trivial and to me is not the issue what i dont like is the distractions all these cars with headlights cause i dont need to constantly see the headlights of the vehicle behind me i dont need to see the headlights of every gosh darn car for a mile down the road these lit up cars make nonilluminated things less visible like pedistrians and bikes hopefully were not going to mandate drls for people and bikes  too  a stream of taillights is tolerable as are the orange front running lights this is certainly sufficient for other people to see you if they look and doesnt distract me nearly as much as full power headlights  mark

  well there is a difference  i dont happen to have my sae manual handy but oil viscosity in general decreases with temperature  the sae numbers are based on a typical curve that oils used to all have running from say the viscosity of a roomtemperature 00weight at 0c down to say that of a roomtemperature  0weight at 00c for a typical 00weight oil  oils that are designed for operation in normal temperatures just have a weight specification  oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a w tacked on the end so in winter in a cold place youd stick 00w in your car in the winter and 00 in it in the summer to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year  modern multiviscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature as a result their viscosity graphs cross over several curves  a multivis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures a normal operating temperature and a cold one though i cant remember the numbers  in any event the weights do indicate a significant difference  remember that your engine is temperatureregulated by the thermostat and radiator or air fins most of the time  unless you overheat it or something  any weight of oil is better than no oil or than very old carbonized oil  thin oil wont in general lubricate as well at temperature thicker oil will like a 00w00 will lubricate better at temperature  but not as well during startup when most engine wear occurs    if youre planning on making long drives the 00w00 is probably fine esp in the summer in your 00w00 car  but if youre making short drives stick to the 00w00    dont drink soap dilute dilute ok

   the reason i ask is because i went to a classic car meet here in the uk and saw a very nice old de soto 0000s vintage id guess with wooden artillery type wheels etc but it was righthand drive i cant believe that desoto produced rhd cars just for the uk  well sweden and australia and lord knows wherever else used to drive on the wrong side of the road so the export market might have been larger then than just the uk  im guessing but i believe in the twenties we probably drove mostly down cattle trails and in wagon ruts  i am fairly sure that placement of the  steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time  by the 0000s there was a very active good roads movement which had its origins actually in the 0000s during the bicycle craze picked up steam in the teens witness the linclon highway association 0000 or so and the us highway support act real name something different in 0000 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads also the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during ww 0 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense  anyway by the 00s there were plenty of good roads at least around urban areas and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside  this was the era after all of the first auto touring fad the motel the auto camp ground etc two good books on the subject spring to mind  warren belasco america on the road title may not be exact  author is and another called the devil wagon in gods country author i forget  also any of john flinks  or john bell raes auto histories  as to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary by the early teens there were virtually no american cars that did not have the wheel on the left  in the early days cars had the wheel on the left on the right and even in the middle as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel  this was standardized fairly early on though i dont know why   dan dh0qandrewcmuedu carnegie mellon university applied history  world history strides on from catastrophe to catastrophe whether we can comprehend and prove it or not                oswald spengler

   i am the person who started out this subject  to me the question really is not about dealer profit but the amount of money for the type of car ive settled with a new 00 subaru wagon with the similar amount of money a saturn dealer asked for a sw0 ok i know its a 00 model but i think i got a better car though i have to adjust my initial idea of  why i am getting a new car  today during a conversion with a friend i learned he rejected a saturn for a ford tarurs as it only costed him a little bit more than a sl0 i may be wrong but a loaded tarus beats a saturn sl0  i agree that a fullyloaded sl0 would come close in price to a lowerend ford taurus  a fullyloaded taurus on the other hand would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy sl0  a fully loaded sl0 would run somewhere around 00000 while a fully loaded taurus lx would be somewhere around the 0000000000 range  a base taurus gl i believe might start around 00000  of course there is the taurus sho which can push 00000 if you really try but this is a totally different car than your mainstream taurus sedan  your statement was not entirely faulty just a little inaccurate   i cant see saturn is of better value and that is why i was puzzled by its pricings oh we did not spend much time getting our deals being better informed has its advantages  well thats ok  at least youre not bitching about dealer profits like some of the other netters are  you seem to have rationally picked out the car that is best for you  the loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by the impreza wagon so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones   then again i may be wrong  yungkao hsu   mihir shah mps0cec0wustledu

  i cant imagine any civic or saturn owners flexn there egos in stop light races it generates as much excitement as two nerds challenging each other in a game of oneonone basketball  the sl0 does 000 in about 00 note that this is closer to a 000 than to a paseo or storm pseudosporty cars thats a ridiculous comparison i know but the point is that saturns and highend civics for that matter accelerate just fine in fact better than most unimproved muscle cars of the 00s 000 hp is great but tied to 0 tons it just doesnt go that quick saturns on the other hand use 000 hp tied to 0000 lbs with some short gearing to move very quickly off the line anyway     while your 000 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports i saw the pbs motorweek show clock a 0speed sl0 at 00 seconds  im sure that most sl0 owners will be very lucky to get this speed but 00 seconds is still astonishingly fast for a small 0door  a new civic ex runs about 00 seconds 000 if im not mistaken  most cars in this class are lucky to be in the 0second range   mihir shah

  apologies if this is a faq is there a faq posting for this group i am an infrequent reader of recautos so i cant remember  i am in the market for a used chevy suburban and have observed that prices for models with diesel engines run about 00000000 less than comparable models with a gas engine  there has to be a reason for this  yes there is  consumer confusion  in the early 00s with the fuel crisis etc everyone wanted better fuel mileage  diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines  so gm decided to conver their 000 gas engine into a diesel engine i think was a 00 liter  big mistake  the engine was not redesigned but converted  the engine could not handle the higher compression etc  lots of problems with these cars  this thew up a big red flag to the casual observer  dont buy a diesel  they are bad  this was a gross generalization  ask yourself this question  if your livelihood depended on driving lots of it would you use a dependable or undependable but cheaper in the short run vehicle  what do greyhound busses have in them trailer trucks  even train locomotives  are these gasoline engines no they are diesel  tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 000000 mile warrantee with they vehicles  i own an 00 diesel suburban  the 00l diesel is a great engine just keeps going  it was more expensive when new than the gasoline engine vehicle was  the only problem with diesel engines is that  when they need to be rebuilt they are expensive  in a gas 000 engine you will pay about 0000 for a rebuild  diesel 00l is about 0000  but then again the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 00 better mileage  a carburator for a gasoline engine costs about 000 to rebuild or less  a rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about 000 or more  but then again you never need a tuneup  if youre looking at a rebuilt 00l id say you got a great deal check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also  good luck  
   in your experience how true is it that a fuel injector cleaning will do much more good than just using detergent gas   while i agree that a clogged fuel injector would darken my day how clogged do they get and is 00 a good price or can i do it myself by buying a can of  what and doing  what   a fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than them opening your gas tank dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner and sending you on your merry way 00 poorer  go to kmart and buy the cleaner yourself for 000   just because you dealer sez you need it dont mean its necessarily so be suspicious   jim grey jwgacd0acdcom

  i know its a long shot but maybe someone went through this and will have some comments to share  the story is this i bought a car out of state and im trying to get the safety inspection in pennsylvania the problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield the tint is rather weak and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint  the inspection garage said that they wont pass it unless i get a waiver from the state police so i went to the state police  the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal and i can get a waiver only for a pre00 car or for a medical reason i asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says its illegal  he showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you cant have tint if you cant see the inside of the car because of the tint when i told him that you can in fact see the inside very well he shut the book and said its just illegal and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now well wont argue with that  since the vehicle code says its ok as long as you can see through the tint id like to keep it ill reread the vehicle code in the library  id also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says its ok so i can get the inspection and so that i wont get in trouble for the tint later on i also wouldnt mind registering a complaint against that officer  he really pissed me off  so does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police especially in pennsylvania does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer i called the station  later on today but they basically said there is no place where i could register a complaint against an officer and if i do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway how much of a chance do i stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court  any comments about it will be welcome  michal

   quad 0 reliable yeah whats your definition of reliable if thats reliable then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect  not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter  balance shaftsthe acura has the engine    wins the reliablity contest hands down you can rev that car all day everyday and youll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else i speak from expierence im not saying the quad 0 is a bad engine but dont highlight reliability when you comparing it to a acura engine  and while the integra costs alot more it is a  a couple of things  blowing a hose doesnt speak of engine reliability and  while it is true that quad0s have a problem with head gasket leaks that was a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected  also i know pontiac is replacing head gaskets that leak for free for 0year00k miles  other than that i have found my quad0 to be completely solid and the direct ignition  system means no wiresrotorrotorcap to ever deal with  also hydrolic lifters mean no valve adjustments ever  im not badmouthing the integra engine i just think you are going overboard on slamming the quad0  you are quite correct that the integra engine is quieter although i would not say smoother my quad0 loves to rev especially at the highend  do you have any evidence of blocks cracking on quad0s  i have not heard of this

    my friend brought a subaru svx recently  i had drove it for couples times and i  think its a great car esp on snow  however when she took it to a local subaru  dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about 00 dollars  the dealer  told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to  disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour  at first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto  but found out the they are charging roughly the same price  so is there any  svx owner out there that has the same problem   and if the oil change story is  true then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me by the way the car  looks great    labour prices for car service are very expensive in toronto compared to other parts of ontario  for example there are places in ottawa that still charge only 00hour  ive seen a couple of places charging 00hour  the cheapest ive heard in toronto is 00hour   swd wan      doug zolmer           internet dwjzbnrca         disclaimer my opinions only bellnorthern research ltd  ottawa ontario canada          conform moooo

   in a previous article dh0qandrewcmuedu daniel u holbrook says  im guessing but i believe in the twenties we probably drove mostly down cattle trails and in wagon ruts  i am fairly sure that placement of the  steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time  by the 0000s there was a very active good roads movement which had its origins actually in the 0000s during the bicycle craze picked up steam in the teens witness the linclon highway association 0000 or so and the us highway support act real name something different in 0000 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads also the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during ww 0 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense  anyway by the 00s there were plenty of good roads at least around urban areas and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside  this was the era after all of the first auto touring fad the motel the auto camp ground etc two good books on the subject spring to mind  warren belasco america on the road title may not be exact  author is and another called the devil wagon in gods country author i forget  also any of john flinks  or john bell raes auto histories  im sorry as i have never heard of any of this  guess they dont think its important enough for a classroom and i was going on what ive seen in picssome moviesreal nice scource there huh  i just always  recall thinking that good roads of asphalt didnt come around til the interstate hiway act or whatever they called it00s and that wood and cobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression except in overpopulated places like england and us cities  obviously netwisdom says i am wrong  as to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary by the early teens there were virtually no american cars that did not have the wheel on the left  in the early days cars had the wheel on the left on the right and even in the middle as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel  this was standardized fairly early on though i dont know why  i knew it was almost always done but i knew of no reason that it might not be done the other way by desoto for their car  seems like they had some other deviations from the norm too at times   dan dh0qandrewcmuedu carnegie mellon university applied history  world history strides on from catastrophe to catastrophe whether we can comprehend and prove it or not                oswald spengler  thanx for corrrecting me and again i aplogize for harebraned post drew

    i agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass you might  not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you dont want to  give them that one carlength when they should just wait like you are  but if youre one of those people that just sits behind the person and  doesnt flash them with the high beams or pull left and flash them or  ride their bumper or otherwise tell them that you do in fact want to   go by and youre not just drafting them then get the hell out of the   way of someone who will  i especially hate it when you flash someone at  the back of a line and they dont pass it on    and theres also the issue of some cars being more intimidating to get   people out of the way than others  for instance 0000 gts look   pretty mean in a rearview mirror at night with the foglights on    there have been plenty of times when ive broken up a pack that a   secondinline hyundai has been behind for miles  you just need to  know how to get their attention   id like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers if they see you they usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle finger extended because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane ahead                                                            hhm

  i consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer  the design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an eeprom  the idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the eeprom  the secondary purpose acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the eeprom being used the microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the hall effect at a rate any higher than 000 mph so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable  this was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 000 mph in operation  the case of course might not be the same for your 0000 rx0  the ecm modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated  since steering angle and velocity data etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers use of the car  i am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ecm  while it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars i personally wouldnt mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion     bill mayhew      neoucom computer services department rootstown oh  000000000  usa    phone 0000000000 wtmuhuraneoucomedu 00000000    000000 n0wed

  howdy  im a little new to this newsgroup but i would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here  the subject  aftermarket cruise controls  the background i recently broke my ankle in a roadbicycling accident 0 places five  screws yuk    in two weeks i will be returning to texas my home from my school byu in provo utah  as you can imagine trying to drive nearly 0000 miles with a broken right ankle isnt just the epitome of a good time  my car does not have a cruise control so i would have to do all the pedalling ha ha with my messedup ankle  my question what is the general opinion of aftermarket cruise control units  i realize that a cheap cc cruise control from say pep boys isnt going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit if there is such a thing  and i uderstand that i probably cant expect much in the way of accuracy looks and that sort of thing  but anythings gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle  i have a 0000 jeep cherokee 0 speed standard 00 00l engine with ketteringsp ignition yknow distributor cap rotor that setupnot electronic  maybe you couldve guessed it being an 00 but im just trying to give information as completly as i can  i found a cc unit for 00 bucks  it seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servormotor  is this good or bad  if i did buy this cc which vacuum hose should i tap  it has two speed sensors  one magnetic and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pickup or so i understand  i can use either one  which is best  the manual says i read it in the store today that the magneticaxle setup is more accurate but harder to install  is there really a big difference  it has a sensor for the brake pedal just like other ccs but does not have a sensor for the clutch pedal  so if i wasnt paying real close attention i might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up  which would wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned  the thing off  im pretty coordinated so this doesnt bother me if it were for my girlfriends car then it would bother me but im ok with it  the installation also calls for an attachment to a steadyon brake signal and a switchedon brake signal  i think i can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse  am i right  but im not sure where to get the steadyon brake signal or for that matter what exactly it is  any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it  i think i can figure the other things out  like how to hookup the negative side tachtype sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit and the ground and all that miscellaneous business  but i need a little help with  0  is it worth the money and safety risk if any for such a     device 0  is there any particularly good aftermarket cc 0  are professionally installed ccs signifacantly better and     worth the cabbage 0  if the unit i saw sorry no manufacturer or model number just     that it is at pep boy and its 00 is sufficient for my simple      needs how do i get the thing installed properly specifically     the questions above  my father and i built a veep volkswagen powered jeep cj0a when i was in high school so i consider myself fairly good with tools electronics and cars  so the installation doesnt scare me  i just want to be certain that i get the thing installed correctly as my cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my veep   i appreciate your time in reading my post and i would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject  if you would like to share some of your wisdom please email as i dont get over this group very often but i check my mail all the time  again thanks for any help anyone may have  mike wieda mikewcancbyuedu

  vervaeke writes      experience with jeep service dept   while not exactly a service incident i had a similar experience recently   when i bought a new truck  i had picked out the vehicle i wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price i wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them id be back that evening to pick up the truck   when i returned i had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me when i finally got in there everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers he then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax  license by about 000 he then said he needed   another 000 from me i said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem i wasnt giving them any more money the finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time i   reminded him that i was the customer and i didnt think i should be   treated like that and that if he didnt back off he could forget the whole   deal he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick it   snatched back my check and left needless to say they were not pleased by   the turn of events  early the next morning i got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened i related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind i told him   that if they gave me the truck for free i probably still wouldnt take it   that there were other dealers in town i was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customersetcetci was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair he gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution etc etc i told   him not to bother thanks id go somewhere else  a couple hours later the owner of the dealership called me all   apologetic etc etc etc and said that they would cover the 000 plus   knock another 000 off the price of the truck i told him id think about   it and he gave me his private direct phone number his secretarys name   and assured me that they valued me as a customer etc etc etc  i thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided what the hellthat was a pretty decent deal so i called him   back and accepted his offer when i went back the next day to pick up the   truck i received the royal treatment everyone seemed to know about the   incident even the lot boy everything went smoothly and i was out of   there in my new truck in about 00 mins  so i guess im a reasonably satisfied customer however it should not   have happened in the first place i was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that i dont expect them to bow and grovel but i   sure dont expect to be given a hard time either esp when its their   mistake  anyway im happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first years license fee   im not sure whether ill go back to that dealer tho  mark

  archivename recautospart0  most recent changes 00 march 0000 addition of altautoskarting  rpw                  welcome to recautos   this article is sent out automatically each month and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups and some suggested guidelines for discussions  the keywords monthly posting will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities  this article is posted to all autos groups but followups are directed only to recautos  if you dont understand what this means ask your system administrator for help or at least for copies of the newuser documentation  failing that please subscribe to the newsgroup newsannouncenewusers and read the documentation provided there  introduction to the recautos newsgroup hierarchy  recautostech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles their design construction diagnosis and service  other discussions are largely inappropriate especially for sale ads  recautossport  is intended for discussion of legal organized competition involving automobiles  technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles  discussion from either of two viewpoints spectator and participant is encouraged  arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate as are most other discussions  for sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles andor equipment discussions of illegal events are marginal one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law  remember the fbi reads usenet  recautosdriving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles also if you must discuss 00 vs 00 or radar detectors or insert your pet driving peeve boneheads do it here  recautosvw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen this includes vws audis seats etc  it was created on the grounds that the infovw mailing list was very successful  it should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such as a mailing list  recaudiocar  is not properly part of the recautos hierarchy  it is however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so is mentioned here  recautosantique  is intended for the discussion of older cars usually more than 00 years old although this is not a hardandfast rule  althotrod  is not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the recautos reader  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles  altautosrodncustom  also not part of the official hierarchy devoted to that peculiar american hobby of customizing older cars  altautoskarting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting  recautos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics   crossposting  crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the newsgroups line in the article header such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed  crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on usenet  you should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience  this distinction is subtle but important  radar detector articles for example are moreorless appropriate in recautos  they are almost never appropriate in scielectronics or rechamradio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in scielectronics or rechamradio is not adequate justification for posting to either group  crossposting between any or all of the recautos groups is usually inappropriate if you find yourself doing so consider whether or not it is truly advisable before sending your article  consider setting followupto to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost  crossposting between recautos and miscconsumers is chancy at best in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us andor the use of radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups  most readers of scielectronics and recradio couldnt care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in recautos  it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups and followupto  lines of articles before posting a followup  in particular be wary of posting to misctest recartsstartrek or talkbizarre or any combination of these three  the life you save may be your own  distribution  there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to partially control where the article goes it is called the distribution field  it may be very useful for many reasons it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system  the distribution of recautos is fairly extensive  as of this writing  the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe australia new zealand and some locations in japan  with this in mind i offer the following hints about use of the distribution field in your article headers and on article content  0 please take care not to send forsale ads about clapped out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason likes mavericks but only 0door mavericks at that  0 when posting technical questions please include the market for which your car was manufactured  for example there are a number of differences between a europeanmarket ford escort and a usmarket escort  likewise all 0000cc and early 0000cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel injection european market cars usually got carbs often webers  these differences can be important to your readers make your situation clear failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation  0 be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values whereas europe is almost entirely on the metric system  a future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonlyused abbreviations that may not be known in some places that recautos reaches this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it  0 use the distribution field to limit where your article goes when possible  within north america the values na north america can canada and usa may be used  in addition the twoletter state abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases eg if i wanted to send an article only to new york and new jersey i could put nynj in a distribution field  note that multiple commaseparated values are legal  these distribution fields vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area  the dangers of overgeneralization  to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars tires etc  what is true for a 0000 buick with a 000cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 0000 honda with a 0000cc engine  headlight laws in sweden are decidedly different from those in idaho  the need for adequate specification  when you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information eg if you have a question about your honda please specify year model engine size etc  otherwise most answers to your question may be quite useless   concerning lemons  at one time or another every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two even honda admits to this  please dont waste everyones time by announcing to the world that your brand x automobile is terrible so all brand x automobiles are terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x company  such articles are worse than useless because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information   concerning flames  as much as we might wish it a flamefree newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur  here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them a list of flameprone topics follows in the next section of this posting  if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory dont imagine for a minute that including the words no flames will work  it wont and youll get exactly what you deserve  if youre going to flame youre more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a wellknown reference  no one is likely to believe bald unsupported assertions  be careful about who you choose to insult  consider not insulting anyone   asking the question  it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please send email i dont read this group  it is a much better idea to end the question with please send email if there is sufficient interest ill summarize the results in a later posting  i may miss posted responses to this request  answering the question  if someone wants to hop up their yugo dont tell them to get a mustang either be silent or give them useful advice  if someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket dont tell them to obey the law next time  its offensive presumes guilt which is not proven and doesnt directly address the original question  in general dont post in order to see your words in print and dont post in order to enjoy feeling smug and selfrighteous   stale andor inflammatory topics  certain topics are considered stale by old timers while discussion of them is certainly ok and new factual information is welcome ravings about them are extremely tiresome and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether  some topics are naturally inflammatory it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them  some of these topics include the following  0  the 00mph speed limit in the us pro and con  0  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors  0  discussions over which radar detector is best  0  discussions over what is a sports car this is one reason why     recautossport is not a sports car group  everyone would argue     about what constitutes a sports car  0  disputes over whether or not us federal law protects the drivers     right to own and operate a radar detector  0  buy american discussions  0  clever bumper stickers and personalized license plates  0  insert nationality here cars are terrible  0  what kind of car did maxwell smart drive       when i have a complete accurate answer it will be added to the           commonlyasked questions article which is also posted monthly           until then please dont waste bandwidth on this topic  rpw    please direct comments and suggestions about this article to       weltycabotballtowncmacom   richard welty        0000000000       weltycabotballtowncmacom nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of   a race car about either its pitch or

  archivename recautospart0  this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast and so is not crossposted to miscconsumers   rpw     changes as of 00 april 0000 revised brake fluid section as     nonsilicone dot0 fluids are now apparently available  rpw                   commonly asked automotive questions   tire questions  q  what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean  a  typically you will see something like 00000hr00  the 000 is the     overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually     narrower  the 00 is the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width  our example tire     has a sidewall height of 000  000  000 mm  the 00 is the wheel     diameter in inches there are also some special tires called trx     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like     000 which is in millimeters  the r means radial and the h is a speed     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly     inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate  common     speed ratings are s 000mph t 000mph h 000mph and v up to     000mph      recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed     rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find     designations like 00000r00 00h the 00 indicates the pertire load     associated with the speed rating  exceeding this load in continuous     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice  what follows is     a table showing a number of load indices and corresponding maximum     pertire loads      load index       00   00   00   00   000   000   000   000   000     max load kg   000  000  000  000  0000  0000  0000  0000  0000      note that the usual mass vs weight confusion occurs in this table      in some cases the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire     size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation     indicates passenger car  if no letter is given then the application     of the tire is passenger car usage  as far as i know these letters     only appear in the us market  the lt designation is prinicipally of     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles  for     the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference     between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at     all      if the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably 00 but may be 00      tires with an ms mudsnow designation may have their speed rating     reduced by 00 kmh about 00mph      there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature     traction and treadwear  temperature and traction are graded     a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is     a numeric rating  these values are of limited value as they     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires  q  my car has tires with a funny size designation  00000hr000 can i put     normal tires on the car  a  your tires are called trx tires they were devised by michelin     because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible     with normal tires michelin used a different diameter wheel for them     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that     more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels     you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your     car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels and horribly     dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner     or possibly blow out at high speed  trx type tires are becoming hard     to find in addition to michelin avon makes suitable tires  goodyear     has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires  q  can i rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side     of my car  a  car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many     say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a     car is now ok this group includes michelin and goodyear others     for example pirelli and nokia will void warranties if such swapping     is done  the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before     rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturers recommendations  q  how many snow tires should i buy and if i buy 0 which end of the     car should i put them on  a  in short 0 and both ends  to explain many drivers in areas that dont     get excessive snow or who dont drive agressively or at all in snow     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice  with a rear     wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car     going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car     a function of the front axle  in a front wheel drive car you start     stop and turn with the front end  the primary risk of putting the     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes     while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards  radar detectors and speed limits  q  why arent there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits     in this qa posting  a  because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between     miscconsumers and recautos always start long tedious and pointless     flame wars  if you want to talk about either of these topics please     subscribe to recautos or altflame and keep it there  safety equipment  q  do airbags really work  a  preliminary statistics suggest the following  airbags work much     better than no belts good 0 point belts alone work much better than     airbags alone and airbags  0 point belts work slightly better than     0 point belts alone  the con to airbags is that some designs tend     to burn the drivers hands when venting the byproducts of the     explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but     not all may knock the drivers hands from the wheel making retention     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult  brake questions  q  do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned  midas     always wants to do this  a  no  there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing     rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors     more often than is strictly necessary  if the rotors are not warped     warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or     to turn them  note also that some rotors the rotors on many hondas     are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical     to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped     or badly grooved  q  they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down  is     this really a good idea  a  it used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade     prone drum brakes  in modern disc brake equipped cars use of     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases     of long steep downhill runs  otherwise modern disc brakes are more     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings      on the other hand many standard drivers license tests in the usa     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking i     suggest that before taking a us drivers test you either 0 learn to     do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or 0 borrow a     car with an automatic to take the test  q  how often should i replace my brake fluid  a  probably more often than you do  traditional brake fluids tend to     absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid  dot0 type     are older fluids dot0 and dot0 are newer specifications  the     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling     point is important in older brake fluid  dot0 fluids have the lowest     wet and dry boiling point requirements dot0 fluids have better     boiling point requirements and dot0 fluids have the best boiling     point requirements but dot0 fluids are not clearly superior see     the next qa for more details  while the requirements imply that     dot0 fluids are better than dot0 fluids there may be specific     cases where a dot0 fluid is preferable but these are mostly     competition applications  otherwise dot0 type fluids offer much     improved brake pedal feel  replacement once a year is recommended for     dot0 fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out     fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly  q  what about dot0 brake fluids  a  this breaks down in to two parts  the dot0 specification looks     excellent for performance but the first dot0 fluids were silicone     based  silicone fluids are a tricky proposition  unlike dot0 and     dot0 fluids they do not absorb water at all  while this may sound     like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in     such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring  the water will tend     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where     most of the corrosion occurs      because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to     silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly     beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the     brake system when converting to silicone fluids      two other issues that come up with silicone fluids  0 they are     difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and 0 while they     generally have much higher boiling points than dot0 fluids they     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable     in effect from boiling dot0 fluids  silicone fluids may make sense     in some street car applications but they are certainly not     recommended for high performance driving applications and the     economics are questionable for street use      i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot0 standard     that do not contain silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably     compatible with the older dot0 and dot0 fluids but i have little     information at this time  q  abs is available on some of the cars im looking at but it costs     more  is it worth it  a  this does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will     be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons  the short answer     is that abs costs more both initially and to maintain will generally     work better for the average driver that is to say a driver who does     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques     and may require the unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case      now for the long answer  abs works by monitering the wheels of the     car looking for signs of locked brakes  it may or may not be able     be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several     systems on the market  it cannot detect impending lockup which is     what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence     of lockup  the sensors used vary some of the less well designed     sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original     equipment or oeequivalent components      when the sensors detect lockup the abs system responds by unlocking     the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the     system  if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the abs     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a     sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could     sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is     achieved  this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as     the system cycles  the percentage of the time that the brakes are     truly engaged is called the duty cycle typically in an abs system     this is about 00  on dry pavement a trained driver can beat this     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking     on wet pavement braking is so chancy that abs will outperform     threshold braking nearly every time  unfortunately on mud and on     snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes     locked only audi of the manufacturers producing absequipped cars     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this     eventuality      a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves     steering control  this is the case simply because if you are     braking near the limit and turn the wheel the abs will release     the brakes if it sees steeringtriggered lockup and back off     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied     braking distances will lengthen accordingly      an important caution  abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical     braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on     glare ice dont expect an abs system to help you out very much     the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an     abs system in your car      as far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential     restrictions ive listed above you have to worry about the     following  0 parts costs are much higher the oe master cylinder     for my obscure european sedan lists for 000 but the oe master     cylinder for the absequipped version of the same car lists for     over 0000  most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot0     silicone brake fluids in absequipped vehicles  because of     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system     components regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid     becomes very important  q  what about this threshold braking business  a  normally id not put this in the consumers qa but recent     publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers     in absequipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is     needed here  rpw      threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high     performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab     the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely and is much     to be prefered  basically the premise is that tires generate     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but     just before the wheels lock up entirely  drivers who threshold     brake learn to feel what this threshold feels like and learn     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake     pedal  in many cars you can feel that you are near the     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it     in any case if you cant hear the tires whine just a bit youre     not very near the threshold      in a car with abs often there is a twinge in the pedal just     before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very     close to the threshold and theyll probably achieve better     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs     take over      recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of     accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with     abs systems  the police departments in question quickly blamed     the new abs systems but according to autoweek magazine it now     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the     involved officers had any recent performance driving training     there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing     brake pedal by pump braking an old and discredited technique     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system  if you     think about it for a minute youll realize that pump braking must     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least     00 so if you cut the 00 duty cycle of an abs system by that     much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason     threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs if     you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at     the pedal will be sufficient      gas questions  q  does high octane gasoline help  a  maybe maybe not  some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the     engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used     on most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your     car run well  check your owners manual for details on what your car     needs  q  my car was made for leaded gasoline  will unleaded gas hurt it  a  it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear     although the amoco oil company argues otherwise  the actual increase     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded     gasolines actually contain very little lead  you should however     check your owners manual many cars from the early 0000s do not     actually require leaded gasoline  q  do fuel treatments help  what kind should i use  a  some do and some dont  during the winter it is a good idea to use     dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems     never use an additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl     alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection      manufacturers opinions vary on additives containing ethanol sometimes     called ethyl alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owners     manual on your car before  using these  most manufacturers consider     00 ethanol acceptable in gasoline  additives with isopropyl alcohol     isopropanol and petroleum  distillates are fine in fuel injected     cars      an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with     fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that     do the same job  some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain     ethanol or methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything     in your gas tank      there are a small number of particularly good additives these are     noticeably more expensive that the runofthemill ones but work     much much better  among these are chevron techron redline sl0     wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg 00k  a bottle of one of these     once every six months is highly recommended  q  what about detergent gasolines  a  the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat bmw     has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this     test may advertise that fact  stickers indicating passage of the test     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations  if such     gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional     beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean     engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits  lubrication questions  q  what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean  a  there are several different items encoded  there is a twoletter     code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer     uses in the oil this looks like sesfcd or such  the s codes are     for gasoline engine applications the c codes are for diesel engine     applications  the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels     of protection are developed thus sf is considered better than se     se is considered better than sd and so forth      the more noticeable designation is the oil weight  this is either     a single number eg 00 weight or a pair of numbers separated by     the letter w eg 00w00  the latter type is much more commonly     used these days and are the only type that most automobile     manufacturers specify in operators manuals  the first number in the     designation 00w is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold     the w stands for winter  the second number 00 is the viscosity     of the oil when hot  there is a trick here the oil doesnt actually     get thicker turn from 00 weight to 00 weight as it gets hotter  what     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity     of a cold 00 weight oil  as it gets hotter it doesnt get thin as fast     as a 00w oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the     viscosity of a hot 00 weight oil      note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not     all 00w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all     00 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot  note also that the     novel behaviour of multigrade oils is caused by additives and it has     been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx 00w00 oils     do not retain their multigrade characteristics well over time  00w00     00w00 and 00w00 oils work very well though  q  are quick lube places any good  a  some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out     there  let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure     that they dont overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on     your wallet at all times  q  are oil additives like slick00 or tufoil any good  a  slick00 and tufoil are ptfebased additives  many of these have     come onto the market recently they are different from the molybased     additives that have been around since the early 00s  ptfe is the     chemical name for teflontm a trademark owned by dupont in general     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products  most usenet     responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight     increase of mpg after application smoother revving but long term     results whether ptfe additives are effective after 0k miles are     debatable  some manufacturers such as saab claim that either the     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage  some bmw owners     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of     slick 00 to their cars  this writer has been cautioned by a slick00     dealer  that slick00 should not be used in japanese motors as     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine  otherwise there are     no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives      on the other hand there are satified slick 00 customers in the world  q  do synthetic oils really work  a  yes but  more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics     but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by     oil manufacturers  auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your     car  even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change     the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty     as conventional oils      synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter     entirely amsoil redline and agip are very highly regarded and very     effective  mobil 0 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however  q  manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals     how often should i change my oil  a  it depends on how you drive  if your car always or nearly always     gets warmed up and you dont drive it very hard and keep the revs     down the manufacturers recommendation is probably fine  if however     you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesnt get up     to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often     perhaps at 0000 mile intervals given that most manufacturers are     now specifying 0000 mile intervals  if you dont drive your car     much at all say 0000 miles a year then you probably want to change     oil every six months anyway  if you are storing a car during the winter     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out     of storage  misc questions  q  my car has a timing belt  i hear that bad things happen when they     break  whats the story  a  it depends on the internal design of the motor  early ford escorts     for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt     some honda motors will not be damaged but others will be      if no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the     belt at least every 00000 miles some cars may require more frequent     replacement  ask your dealer or independent mechanic  also ask if     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time     for example the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have     a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize     destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage     as a side effect  replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water     pump can be a costly mistake  q  why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it     self destructs when the timing belt breaks  a  for performance reasons  compromising piston design so that the     valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance     oriented vehicles  q  what causes unintended acceleration  a  the final report of the national highway transportation and safety     administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the     same time be consistent with the physical evidence  the nhtsa report     goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator     is probably the cause   richard welty        0000000000       weltycabotballtowncmacom nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of   a race car about either

  i saw an interesting product in ny auto show and would like to  hear your comments  militechtm is yet another oil additive but the demonstration of this product really impressive if it didnt cheat  the setup of the demo is fairly simple a cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink filled with motor oil the rotor is powered by an electronic motor a metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction  the torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench  before militech was added the rotor was stopped with about 00 lbft of torque you pick the brand of oil no difference once militech was  added to the oil the rotor could not be stopped even with 000 lbft of torque   here is the good part even after the salesman emptied the oil sink  you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it  they say you need only add 0oz per quart of oil every 00k miles a 00 oz bottle is 00  i still have my doubts if this product is really so great why it was so little known the salesman said it is widely used in military i didnt believe it  the demo was so impressive that i bought a bottle against my common sense  has anyone heard of or actually used this product is it real if you are going to the auto show please visit this stand on the  second floor see if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not  jason chen

  archivename recautospart0  this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions of general consumer interest and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to miscconsumers  rpw  last change 0 february 0000 ct now permits radar detector usage     new tiretraction qa  rpw                  commonly asked questions  radar questions  q  where are radar detectors illegal  a  in the us currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors  new york prohibits their use in     large trucks  in canada they are illegal in manitoba ontario     quebec newfoundland and pei prince edward island  they     are apparently are illegal through most if not all of europe     legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal  q  where are radar detector detectors used  do they really work  a  usage is spreading rapidly initially they were used only in canada     but now they are appearing in new york and virginia  it is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in connecticut and dc     they work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super het radar detectors some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others and are thus more likely to be spotted     new radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors  note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on  q  what is vascar  is it some kind of radar  a  vascar is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and timespeeddistance     computer  it depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks  no radar signals are emitted by a vascar     system  q  what is ka band radar  where is it used  should a radar detector be     able to handle it   a  ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us     in socalled photoradar installations  in these installations a     lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a 00 degree angle to the     direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit     tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle  because of the low     power and the 00 degree angle many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway  the number of locales where photoradar is in use     is limited and some question the legality of such units  best advice     learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they     are used or else dont speed  q  do radar jammers work  are they legal  a  quick answer  no and not in the usa     detailed answer  cheap radar jammers do not work well at all     jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military  jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     federal communications commission of the usa  driving technique and vehicle dynamics questions  q  what are understeer and oversteer  a  understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the limit limit of adhesion that is     most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter  simply put they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less     or understeer or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer     understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast wont get into     trouble  understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner  oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars it may be induced by lifting on the throttle trailing     throttle oversteer or tto  in extreme cases lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning      some technical details  in a corner at speed the tires on the car     will develop what are called slip angles the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel  in understeer the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels  in oversteer the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels  q what is a revmatched downshift  a when downshifting the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear  however during a downshift normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop    rather than increase  in revmatched downshift you blip the throttle    before reengaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed  this results in a much smoother and faster downshift  q what does heelandtoe mean  a heelandtoe is a technique used to do a revmatched downshift while    braking  this is normally challenging because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle  it is called heelandtoe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift  in many modern cars this is a misnomer    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle     note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplishing    the same thing  q what is doubleclutch downshifting  a while your right foot is doing the above your left foot can do one of    three things  nothing declutch once or declutch twice  the reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine  this is usually coupled with    revmatching so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up     the procedure is as follows    0 declutch    0 move gearshift lever to neutral    0 engage clutch    0 match revs    0 declutch    0 move gearshift lever to next lower gear    0 engage clutch     this sounds like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural    the problem that doubleclutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox  in transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros doubleclutching makes it much easier to shift    basically if you doubleclutch well you are not using the synchros at    all  this is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition  q what do the numbers for acceleration from 000 00 mile skidpad and    slalom times in the auto magazines really mean  may they be compared  a in short 0 not as much as the magazines want you to believe and    0 almost never     in more detail  the acceleration numbers 000mph and 00 mile times    in the us may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source  testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a road  track number to a car  driver number is quite    pointless  keep in mind too that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the    major part of the equation     skidpads vary and even if they didnt skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires they change radically    when tire compounds change  do not make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of say two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers    this is not to suggest that skidpads are without value however skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools  they are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires     slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts of the    automobiles transient response  however they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corners of the    cars envelope  they do not tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision  for example they dont tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes offcamber  when a car    has an adjustable suspension these tests are usually done in the sport    setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving  the list of    caveats could go on for page after page  q my buddy claims that wide tires dont make any difference according    to his freshman physics textbook and that you cant ever accelerate    or corner at more than 00g  does he know what hes talking about  a 0 in short  he hasnt got a clue     0 in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth  dry and nondeformable    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature     pavement is never smooth it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent  tires which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over  in a tire    at operating temperature grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term  the colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually reverting to liquid which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking    this latter though is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving so unless youre a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving dont worry about it     because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 00g and race cars corner and brake at more than    00g  because simple friction does not apply it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip  an actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as finite element analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism  misc questions  q  what does name or acronym stand for  a  here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked     about be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names     as misinformation abounds on

piech families  porsche has extensive business dealings with vwaudi     which causes some confusion  since currently porsche is in some     financial difficulty there is a possibility that mercedes or

   this is a twosided problem unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time the breeding of these lowlifes is getting worse our justice system is at best extremely weak to handle these problems that is why lowabiding citizens should have the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary  anywhere a threat is imminent  my camaro my pride and joy got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back the persons that did that were eventually caught lucky for me but not before having trashed the car  on another occasion on my way from texas to florida i had stopped in a small motel for the night in a small town somewhere in florida about 0 youths were disturbing my car setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out when i and another tenant walked out with a 000 magnum and a 00 automatic respectively they vanished  needless to say i immediately packedup and left  watch out for carjacking and staged accidents they can be deadly  steve heracleous

  drew eckhardt writes  most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators and ive never seen nor heard of a vandal opening one  i imagine that there would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have to crawl furthur under the car to open it  car vandals are usually real traditional in their methods and do things that dont get them dirty like keying your car dumping sand sugar or mothballs in the gas tank tping it etc  usuallygo enough places and youll see stuff happen you didnt think did   steve

  is clear coat really worth it  yes on the showroom floor the cars have this deep lustrous shine that just cant be found on paint jobs that arent clear coated  on the other hand it seems that every clear coated car that ive seen on the road in a parking lot etc has fine scratches throughout the paint job  as does alas my 0000 laser  several weeks ago i had my car professionally polished and waxed when i picked it up it had that same showroom shine that i remember from a year ago when i bought it  several days ago i took my car to the dealership for some work  as an added bonus they washed my car  unfortunately whoever washed it either didnt get the roof which is black the rest of the car is red completely clean before he dried it or he used a dirty towel  now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that arent really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle  i am to put it mildy somewhat peeved about this  do i have any  chance of getting the dealership to do something about this my guess is no  is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem  or am i faced with the prospect of having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches information commiseration and sympathy all greatly appreciated     scott thedealershipwillneverwashmycaragain borders sbordersnyxcsduedu bordersscotttandemcom

  i have a 0000 acura integra 0 speed with 00000 miles on it it is positively the worst car i have ever owned i had an 00 prelude that had 000k miles on it when i sold it and it was still going strong   this is with religious attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc both cars were driven in exactly the same manner    0 it has gone through two clutches which are underrated   0 0 sets of tires really eats tires in the front even with careful align   0 all struts started leaking about 0000k miles   0 windshield wiper motor burned up service note on this one   0 seek stop working on radio about 00k miles   0 two timing belts   0 constant error signals from computer    0 and finally a rod bearing went out on the no 0 piston seriously damaging      the crankshaft contaminating the engine etc when the overhaul was done      last week it required new crankshaft one new cam shaft has two because      the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it the camshaft took 0      weeks to get because it is on national back order        everything on the engine is unique to the 0000 year they went to a new      design in 00 parts are very expensive  no way would i ever buy another acura it is highly overrated

  wrt performance converter lockup is purely irrelevant  the lockup only occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve mpg  mind you a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving mpg but the additional mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration vs locked converter clutch than its inherent losses take away  the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions  i get much stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup which i can induce by briefly lifting off  then quickly but not too quickly to trigger a kickdown applying throttle  above 0000 rpms the convertor will never unlock  it would kickdown first  who says theres no skill involved in driving an automatic  i think of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal  with my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my right foot while having both hands to steer   eliot

have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you  i owned a 0000 toyota celica gt  i decided to buy myself a gift  a more exotic car  front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche 000 0000 model years i narrowed it down to those two  i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche  the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance  almost a personal luxury car  it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 000 i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 000 but i decided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way  i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car   if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the 00 celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be 0 years newer  our lowerrisk division will continue to handle your account   if you buy the porsche 000 well have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double  and if you go with a 000 its another story again  well cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that   but the supra is much faster than the 000 and the 000 is actually faster than the standard 000  that doenst make sense    thats what the book says  we dont insure corvettes either  for some reason the underwriters consider supras  and their drivers  as very traditional and conservative   i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons  the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressure guy in the back room  at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance  i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft                 everyones entitled to my opinion                goldbergoasysdtnavymil imagination is more important than

   the biggest hurdle for automatics imho is not shifting speed per se but rather the transmissions reaction speed when you try to force it to shift manually    this was the biggest fault with the subaru ecvt  it took soooooo lonnnnnnnnggggg for the tranny to find the right ratio  the sales propaganda says the saturn automatic is effectively an electronicallyshifted manual  might this mean that saturn has conquered the problem  i dunno only driven saturn 0speeds  input please  another question  any plans for a manualtrans chrysler lh does anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo

    the chevrolet brothers were respected racers  test drivers for the buick co when durant was there  when the directors kicked durant out of gm in 0000 he took chevrolet and others with him  as mentioned before they founded the successful chevrolet company  a littleknown fact is that the chevrolet co actually took over gm that was how durant got back in charge of gm legally his new company chevrolet co did the buying and gm was a division of chevrolet  after 0000 and into the sloan era gm shuffled things so that the gm board was superior but there was always a degree of autonomy given the chevy division presumably because of the initial structure if you look at the organization chart for gm in sloans book chevy division reports directly to 00th floor not through the passenger car division which covers buick olds cadillac and oaklandpontiac  jeff hagen    minor deity of worthless autotrivia  hagenjdacwfuedu

  hagenjdwfuedu jeff hagen writes    the biggest hurdle for automatics imho is not shifting speed  per se but rather the transmissions reaction speed when you  try to force it to shift manually      i rented an oldsmobile achieva is that a yuppie name or what and a nissan stanza  they both had automatics  im a manual transmission bigot but i have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were better shifters than i am  and yes they responded very quickly to kickdown requests  the nissan had a tachometer so i was able to figure out which gear i was in  the olds may have also but i dont remember  i believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 00 mph when my foot told it no i really want to accelerate quickly  i would still prefer a manual but i wont delude myself into thinking that i can outaccelerate a modern automatic  and im very smooth at shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic   tommy reingold att bell labs holmdel nj tommybooleattcom or attbooletommy

  the idea here is to list pointless options you know stuff you get on a car that has no earthly use   0 power windows  i like my power windows i think theyre worth it  however cruise control is a pretty dumb option whats the point if youre on a long trip you floor the gas and keep your eyes on the rearview mirror for cops right  power seats are pretty dumb too unless youre unlucky enough to have to share your car otherwise youd just adjust it once and just leave it like that    allen tom youre not like the others you like the same  atomsodaberkeleyedu    things i do wax paper boiled football  atomnetcomcom           leather dog breath were not hitchhiking   anymore were riding  ren

   an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy  it switches to sport mode when the electronics figure it  not when the driver sets the switch which is the proper way to do it imo  so what does sport mode entail  several things  0 revving to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy  0 delayed upshifts  ie if you lift off briefly it will remain in the low gear  this is handy if you are charging through corners and would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when theres another curve approaching  0 part throttle downshifts based on the speed at which the pedal is depressed rather than the position of the pedal  modern electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough  also i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick all else being equal remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 0000 in 0th gear of a 0 speed    how many  of people who drive manuals really know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation  im sure there will be some who know but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenarioratio combinations stored in rom is likely to do better  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout high gear low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear high revs and small throttle opening  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it but not that obvious at first sight   eliot

  in recautos you write  if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission it cant be half bad    this mclaren autotransmission i still think its only half auto but you may be right has nothing to do with your gm chrysler volvo or whatever auto transmission its a normal manual transmission gearbox with clutch and all but there are servo motors which do the shifting   that means there is no power loss in the drivetrain if you take out  minimal mechanical friction and the samiauto transmissions  ferrari williams mclaren dont tell you when to shift either however these transmissions share an important disadvantage with your stock autotrannie they are expensive  as long as these servoshifted gearboxes arent available on  normal cars im gonna stick with my manual i just cant see an advantage to make up for two grand i lose in this deal and the loss in mileage and power except maybe in real heavy traffic but then i drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway  theres no point in making a religion out of this i just wanted to point out a few technical facts and my own opinion so theres no need for a flame war  eliot  have a safe ride  chris

  jonghalcyoncom barking weasel writes   schludermannsscvx0sscgov writes   my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever if for some reason i miss the shift window i lightly press the accelerator  try agian ive found that clutchless shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms 00000000 i also skip gears some times using 000 0000          sounds about right  i usually slip it out during throttledown and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right usually about a second and then slip it into gear      so how did you guys learn this is it something you were born with or did you make horrible grinding noises the first few times how many times      i would think youd have to have a certain amount of feel for it to begin with some people would never get it and others like me would never have the guts to try it unless maybe you were planning to buy a new transmission anyway      btw ive heard that quite a few truckers and race car drivers shift this way    zaphodmadnixuucp ron bean uwvaxastroatcnicmadmadnixzaphod

  there may be a case where a speed limit sign is not necessary but take them away entirely  yeah youre right  doing away with speed limits would just mean huge tax increases as municipalities tried to make up for the revenue they used to gouge from passing motorists    
  so is cocaine  whats your point  that neither is harmful when used carefully     
  wratunisqluucp wharfie writes compare either to the porsche 000 and you tell me which was designed  oh right  only 000000 dollar cars should be driven fast they drive goddamn rabbits at 000 mph in europe pal and i reckon a taurus is at least as capable as a rabbit  my whole point was not to say that the cars couldnt go that fast but that they shouldnt go that fast  a family sedan designed to be operable at 00mph doesnt suddenly become operable at 000mph because you added some plastic aero effects slightly wider tires and a much larger engine  thats what the sho is  a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine  they didnt even bother improving the brakes  the mustang is essentially the same deal as the sho  a big power plant stuck in a midsize sedan with almost no other modifications i have reallife experience with the mustang  it handles like a brick except when youre invoking oversteer of course something i personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is inadequate even from 00mph  lots of accelleration  but the rest of the car is not up to par  i picked the porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind  it didnt have to be the 000  it could have been the much cheaper 000 or one of several mercedes or audi models  all of these cars are fairly expensive  but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed  this should be elementary  there are a few things to keep in mind about europe since you brought it up  my autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but i believe the following to be true  0 drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are here 0 the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than    they are here and usually include animal fences  this makes them    far more predictable than most us highways 0 not all of europe is the autobahn  most places in europe have    speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in    the us  if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not    much higher than 000kmh  i strongly suspect you wont find a lot of rabbit owners doing 000mph nearly 000kmh on the autobahn but i could be wrong  some people have no respect for their own lives  you certainly havent convinced me  of course not  speedingisbad  speedingisillegal  iwillnotspeed  ilovebigbrother  you had your mind made up already  if you think so you sure dont pay attention to my postings  jim frost jimfcenterlinecom

   one thing that everyone is forgetting in this argument over the pricing of the sc0 vs the japanese cars is the saturns nodicker sticker  this makes the saturns price low in comparison to the inflated base prices of the japanese competition on paper but in reality one could dicker several hundred dollars off the price of the japanese cars  admittedly though here in canada at least the sc0  is in the same price class as the civic si not the sc0  steve hui

  wasnt the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver so he could see where he was backing up  although reverse lights on the sides  no reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up they arent bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail lights   are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the path of the car i dont think warnings were their original intents since they are colored white  well red and orange were already taken maybe white defines the direction that the car is moving in   if you really want to be able to see behind you get some fog lamps for the back of the car these work very well  and are a good way to get rid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone  craig      chintan amin the university of illinois urbanachampaign mail llamauiucedu neil peart c0000 quick to judge quick to anger slow to understand ignorance and prejudice andfearwalkhandinhand  
  i deleted your name because i dont want to sound accusative in my remark    this is a twosided problem unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time  the breeding of these lowlifes is getting worse our justice system is at best  extremely weak to handle these problems that is why lowabiding citizens should have  the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary   anywhere a threat is imminent    my camaro my pride and joy got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back  the persons that did that were eventually caught lucky for me but not before  having trashed the car    on another occasion on my way from texas to florida i had stopped in a small motel  for the night in a small town somewhere in florida about 0 youths were disturbing my  car setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out when i and another tenant  walked out with a 000 magnum and a 00 automatic respectively they vanished   needless to say i immediately packedup and left    watch out for carjacking and staged accidents they can be deadly   im not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons but i would ask you if  you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your alarm  i can think of worse things in the world  glad you got out of there before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun  we can all ask whats happening to society these days but dont forget to ask another important question too what effort am i expending to make it any different than it is  just my thoughts joe karolchik

  i know that this isnt the group for it but since you brought it up does anyone have any idea why they havent bombed the waco cult      perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all testified that the batf shot first they they did not identify themselves before tossing in concussion grenades not that anyone inside could have heard such identification after being near a concussion grenade and the announcement from the batf that they have sealed the warrant under which they were operating  which was a search warrant by the way not an arrest warrant  in short perhaps because the batf is wildly out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a compound full of woman and children will not improve their position there is a real chance that koresh will be able to prove selfdefense in court  that will leave  what  four officers dead and no one to blame but the batf  followups directed to altactivism where the discussion has raged nearly as long as the seige and which shows every sign of not giving up nearly as soon  larry smith smithctroncom  no i dont speak for cabletron  need you ask  liberty is not the freedom to do whatever we want it is the freedom to do whatever we are able

   stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted the mustang is essentially the same deal as the sho  a big power  the mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the sho  plant stuck in a midsize sedan with almost no other modifications i have reallife experience with the mustang  it handles like a brick except when youre invoking oversteer of course something i  its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock mustang because of the suspension  personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is inadequate even from 00mph  lots of accelleration  but the rest of the car is not up to par  yes when i think mustang i think schoolbus   f00 motor in my mind the mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 0000 or so it just isnt safe check out your local junkyard mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards  i find it astonishing the cu or somesuchlike has not jumped on the mustang for poor brakes in relation to power ford should at least standardize on the svo rear brakes for all 00s     i picked the porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind  it didnt have to be the 000  it could have been the much cheaper 000 or one of several mercedes or audi models  all of these cars are fairly expensive  but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed  this should be elementary  there are a few things to keep in mind about europe since you brought it up  my autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but i believe the following to be true  0 drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are here  true of northern europe latin countries are something else  0 the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than kindof true remember they were build by adolf in the 00s     they are here and usually include animal fences  this makes them    far more predictable than most us highways  yes  0 not all of europe is the autobahn  most places in europe have  autobahn is the german word for freeway other countries have different names for loose equivalents autostrada autoroute motorway etc     speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in    the us  if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not    much higher than 000kmh  europe did seem on the brink of a 000kmh limit it hasnt passed as far as i know typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the us law enforcement is negligible in my experience comapred to the us as there is no revenue enhancement motivation the things you really notice are the higher speed differentials and the more professional attitude to driving you just never see two cars running parallel at 000 mph oblivious to all around them   i strongly suspect you wont find a lot of rabbit owners doing 000mph nearly 000kmh on the autobahn but i could be wrong  some people  youre wrong gtis  go this fast just kind of noisy not the ideal  autobahn car a lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor how do i know  when youre not making any ground on the identical car in front of you  have no respect for their own lives  if something happens at 000000 youre dead but the same goes for much over 00 driving at high speed forces you to concentrate i feel much safer driving 000 on the autobahn than 0000 in typical us traffic because most people seem to be awake ive never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn i see it all too often in the us  craig  it just doesnt seem fast after 00 minutes or so of aclimation everybody drives that fast no big deal   craig  you certainly havent convinced me  of course not  speedingisbad  speedingisillegal  iwillnotspeed  ilovebigbrother  you had your mind made up already  if you think so you sure dont pay attention to my postings  jim frost jimfcenterlinecom

   their problem i wasnt giving them any more money the finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time i   reminded him that i was the customer and i didnt think i should be   treated like that and that if he didnt back off he could forget the whole   deal he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick it   snatched back my check and left needless to say they were not pleased by   the turn of events  thats nothing  when a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldnt give her the bimbo treatment her first choice was a mazda 000 and second choice was a nissan sentra  we went to a mazda dealership and described what we wanted  we started negotiating on the price and the salesdroid kept playing the let me run this price by the sales manager  after playing the good salesman bad salesman game we finally told him that if he didnt have the authority to negotiate a price perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did  he brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book  read remar suttons dont get taken every time for a list  finally after playing a few more rounds of youll have to work with us on this price also known as each time you come up a thousand dollars well come down ten the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies stood up and said well we cant come down any more so i guess we cant help you and they trouped out of the room leaving us sitting in the salesmans office all by ourselves  hmm id read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer and i mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door  for lack of anything better to do i picked up the phone on the desk and called another mazda dealership asked for a salesman and began discussing what kind of price they would consider  a few sentences into the conversation mr salesmanager broke into the line  and began telling me how rude he thought it was that i would call another dealership from his phone  i said that since hed announced that our business was over he shouldnt care and every time i tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own  how did he know that i was using the phone anyway  finally i hung up and we headed out of the showroom sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again  we say that we wont bother him anymore were going next door to the nissan dealership  then comes the part i wish i could have videotaped  as we go out the front door the sales manager shouts across the entire showroom customers and all go ahead  you deserve to buy a nissan so my friend bought a sentra  just so the guilty wont go unpunished ill mention that the sales managers name was gary tusone  from his manner his refusal to come down to a reasonable price and his anger at the end my guess is that he had bet our original salesman who was a young novice that hed be able to get at least x dollars out of us and he was steamed that we wouldnt fall for his slimy tricks

   hi maybe someone can help me here i am looking to buy this 0000 nissan maxima gxe for cdn00000 right now  so its an automatic dont know if us speccdn spec for maximas  the car has 00000 km or about 00000 miles on it a typical mileage for 0000 cars seem to be about 00000 km or about 00k mi the seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards  he said he will replace the components before selling the car to me  being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars i dont know what this could mean is 00k km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items or is this an indication that the car was abused  if it is the first set of brake pads on front then this is fine my car eats a set every 00k miles or so the fact that he is replacing the muffler too is also ok  would other things break down or have to be replaced soon  the mileage is fairly low  but typical fwd stuff is cv joints check the maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve adjustments timing belt changes and so on  the 00k mile service is often expensive so make sure he has done everything   the seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot but i dont know how to verify this  ive seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood though  well this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a car with highway miles  might check the gas pedal wear too ask him how many sets of tires he has been through a highway car might have squeezed by on 0 sets a hard driven car 000 sets   although the maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept its currently out of warranty a similarly priced 00 accord with 00k km will have 0 years or 00k km worth of warranty left and i dont want to worry about paying for any repair bills  well the maxima should be pretty reliable  but if its out of warranty you should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first stuff for japanese cars can be expensive  but i also need a car for 0 people    when will the new maxima come out by the way  0000 model year i believe   i would very much appreciate your input in this please reply by email preferred or post in this newsgroup  craig thanks  ryan     ryan kim university of toronto eecg computer graphics    rkimeecgtorontoedu do not weave between traffic cones at road works                                      from the new british highway code                                            toronto star april 0 0000

   no reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up they arent bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail lights    craig  perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights are for couldnt we agree that they serve the dual purpose of letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse and that they can also light up the area behind your car while youre backing up so you can see  backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used to be on older cars those on my taurus wagon are quite bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car and theyre  much brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 00s and 00s   insofar as vettes having side backup lights look at a 00 or 00 model or perhaps a year or two earlier too and youll see red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the cars hindquarters  those arent just white reflectors   harv

  how do i square this with a respectable resale value  easy if its expensive  to buy new its gonna be expensive to buy used  a patently false statement try this logic on an alfa 000 in fact  marketplace has a wonderufl mechanism to adjust the value of the cars that  are overpriced by the manufacturer if it is expensive to buy new it is not  necessarily expnesive to buy used in fact it could be real cheap to buy  used depending what that car is of course note that i do not question your  statements on the reliability of wrangler i have never owned one driven one  or been in one i do love to have one though    what i dont understand is why  this apparent neglect of quality for so many years has not filtered down into  the used marketis jeep so intoxicating so irresistable and so seductive as  to make its purchase a fatal attraction  bijan    yep  they are popular vehicles  you dont see a lot of previous model year ones sitting on dealers lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are out  the things sell they are popular  because they are popular and highpriced new they are high price used very simple  i knew they were overpriced when i bought it i knew they had a terrible  reliability record when i bought it  but i didnt expect anything like i got especially with a dealer network unable to repair it  personal experience has quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine  dave  
  jimfcenterlinecom jim frost writes  there are a few things to keep in mind about europe since you brought it up  my autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but i believe the following to be true  my knowledge about driving in the us is also secondhand but i think i can correct your statements about our autobahn  0 drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are here  oh yeah that would be paradise in fact you can forget it from all ive heard from my us relatives drivers esp here in germany are much more agg ressive but not disciplined one of my relatives a la resident hired a car at the nuernberg airport and went about 00 miles to our home he said then that he grew about 0 year older during this ride and swore hed never drive a car in germany again this was in 0000 and he kept his promise  the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic what you mean by better disciplined should perhaps be considered cautious due to fear  when driving around here you always have to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you they expect that nobody fails or sleeps many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go of course only where that is allowed you might think  dream on  so any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health  and if youre ex posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver you learn to handle it  or you lose  thats the way i and most people i know experience our traffic situation   whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you i think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest compared to the volume and decreasing rates of lethal accidents  otoh more and more people esp women dislike driving because they feel overtaxed and threatened and each accident is one accident too much  0 the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than    they are here and usually include animal fences  this makes them    far more predictable than most us highways  better designed and maintained may be  but animal fences are very rare auto bahnen and many other streets have guardrails i hope thats the right word   a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights its about 0 feet high those guardrails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road smaller animals can crawl under the plank bigger ones can easily jump over it the point is that esp larger animals are very rare in germany they tend also to be very timid accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger  0 not all of europe is the autobahn  most places in europe have    speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in    the us  if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not    much higher than 000kmh  youre right there are speed linits even on the major part of the autobahn  but the attitude towards driving see above seems to be very similar to that in germany ive been in france switzerland italy austria spain belgium the netherlands  besides that you really cant rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits ive got quite a lot of practise 000k miles and im used to travel at 000 mph fyi with a car even smaller than a rabbit but i consider driving on the highways round paris or milano really a thrill  i strongly suspect you wont find a lot of rabbit owners doing 000mph nearly 000kmh on the autobahn but i could be wrong   sorry but youll find quite a lot rabbitclasscar or even smaller mine is a peugeot 000 owners going that fast small cars with much hp are very hip over here  and most people buying such cars arent afraid to let them run                                                          some people have no respect for their own lives  i disagree the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant formula0 cars weigh less than 000 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 000 mph or higher  otoh when crashing against a solid object at 000 mph it makes no difference whether you sit in a porsche a mercedes a tank or on a bicycle yourre dead  bye stefan  stefan dalibor daliborimmd0unierlangende  and now for the next case in kangaroo court i accuse you of being the reincarnation of adolf hitler  i dont think that mere denials will be sufficient  you will have to submit to examinations by a parapsychologist that i personally select perry metzger pmetzgershearsoncom in article 0000 in newsadminpolicy  
  i too was puzzled by this obvious untruth what i think is going on is that nissan claims that the altima is the best selling new car namelplate in the us i think i have this near verbatim lee iaccocas statistics dept would have been proud of that sentence   note that the corollaprism are also new designs but hey are not new  nameplates  i guess nissan doesnt even sell as many altimas as toyota does corollas or there would be no nameplate qualifier

   jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says  can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc  i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i am considering the mx0 probe accord corolla and the 000sx   i bought a 00 probe gt with the pep 000a last july now at 0000 miles after debating over the sentra sernx0000 mx0 mr0 stealth prelude  and celica  the car design is different than earlier years so its too early to see its reliability so far  for what its worth my comments  my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal  some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented  about this problem but i havent seen it happen on my 0 month old  00 probe gt  i think this may be something that ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars  also someone said that ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it  headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke 0000 miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely  havent seen any of these problems nor have i seen these mentioned on the mailing list so these might just be having bad luck with these  crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical  definitely  parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not  stitched properly  hopefully just a fluke  no problems like these either  i havent been able to find any obvious  places where they screwed up  ford only gives 0 key with the car  cmon ford spend an extra few pennies  hmmm  i got two keys with my car  something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this  actually if you count the credit card key that  came in the owners binder i got 0 keys but since the credit card key doesnt have any teeth cut in it yet i guess i wont count it   rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  im waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference  the latter is probably because of the air bag  its pretty much takes up all the space where youd expect to find the horn  speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns  tires fling dirtmud onto side of car   yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes  my likes

00000vr00 goodyear eagles 00 left hoping for 00k   i agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine  the interior is very very nice too  very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound   i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probes suspension doesnt like potholes  when you test drive one find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is  tolerable  yes this cars stiff suspension isnt for everyone  i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car id strongly suggest looking into the mx0  if you have 0 passengers by all means bring them along too  theyll find that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides differently if thats better is up to you    the problem with the back seat is that theres no leg room  plenty of  head room though  shorter people fit back there without any complaints so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to  give them a place to put their feet  also theres a lot of glass around you which i wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer  my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat  the power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car  i really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then ive always been a sucker for open air driving  no leakage problems or anything like thatyet  ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine  i havent heard about this one  i know that some of the very early probes 00 and maybe 00 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which ford will replace at no charge but i havent heard about anything like this concerning the 00 probes  i havent had any real trouble with this car outside of a cv joint boot that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car  i was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering that i was expecting the worst from them  from what ive heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with  the probe and probably mx0 when they first went into production but  i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point  thats almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though  hope this helps  chuck      chuck kesler                       internet   chuckeosncsuedu    unix systems

  hello netters  im visiting the us im from sweden in august i will probably rent a chevy beretta from alamo ive been quoted 000 for a week 00 for additional days  this would include free driving distance but not local taxes baltimore  they also told me all insurance thats necessary is included but i doubt that  cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more insurance than whats included in the base price but on the other hand he didnt rent it from alamo  does anyone have some info on this  is 000 a ripoff  probability that ill be needing more insurance is the beretta a good rental car  thanx  markus   
  nancyhayduke nancy feagans writes ashtrays and cigarette lighters  these should be an option  gm at least is heading in that direction  one of the postsale questions they asked me was if id like the choice of a cigarette liter or an accessory plug and another whether id like the choice of an ashtray or a cup holder  the 00 geo storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option which did not exist in the 00 i bought  im not sure about the ash tray vs cup holder  its a step in the right direction  the ashtray does make a convenient changeholder so its not completely useless  jim frost jimfcenterlinecom

  rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  im waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference  the latter is probably because of the air bag  its pretty much takes up all the space where youd expect to find the horn   all toyotas have airbags with a real horn come on how hard can it be to put a little pressure plate there i hope toyota doesnt follow everyone else and make the horns little buttons that i wouldnt want to fumble for  john    john nielsen   magnus consultant                     to you baldrick the renaissance was just           something that happened to other people             wasnt it  the black adder

   jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says  can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc  i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i am considering the mx0 probe accord corolla and the 000sx   the probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions but every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value btw the 000sx is rearwheel drive and is due for a redesign for 0000   thanks in advance  while i dont read normally read this group i was looking for valentine radar information sigh maybe in the faq and came across your posting  i bought a 00 probe gt with the pep 000a last july now at 0000 miles after debating over the sentra sernx0000 mx0 mr0 stealth prelude  and celica  check this months consumer reports for previous probe records    my criteria a fun car with abs airbag over 000hp and less than 00k i thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out the tristar cars eclipsetalonetc were out since they dont have an air bag ditto for the mustangalso no abs the sernx0000m00 fell into the pocketrocket category  a good used car buy the mx0 was almost there but rolled more than i liked   i didnt like the prelude dashinstrumentation at all  too weird for me the mr0 has a much smaller nonpassenger space than i needed so out that went the celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat overpriced too in nonturbo form i never considered the 000sx since it didnt have an airbag  i did look at it for its rwd virtues but thats it  the corolla never entered my mind i should have looked at the mitsubishi vr0dodge stealth more since my list was exhausted i bought the probe    the car design is different than earlier years so its too early to see its reliability so far  for what its worth my comments  my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke 0000 miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not  stitched properly  hopefully just a fluke ford only gives 0 key with the car  cmon ford spend an extra few pennies rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  im waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference tires fling dirtmud onto side of car   my likes engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque  definitely 0 handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the 0 speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the 00 sho i drive stability at 000mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather absair bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still tires 00000vr00 goodyear eagles 00 left hoping for 00k   as you can see im primarily interested in the engine  while it doesnt have the uummmph of a bigliter car or the turbo rush the big selling point for me was the allaluminum 00 value 00 liter engine    the overall car is a good buy for the money  that market segment hasnt changed much since july prelude vtec honda del sol  i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probes suspension doesnt like potholes  when you test drive one find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable if you have 0 passengers by all means bring them along too  theyll find that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides differently if thats better is up to you  also theres a lot of glass around you which i wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer  my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat  ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine leather and the keyless entry system werent available when i got the car so i cant comment on them i got the car before it was officially announced   i prefer cloth to leather anyway    i wouldnt want this car in the snow  the suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes tires arent meant for snow and the seats assume that youre not wearing lots of thick clothing  rain is much better  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable and i barely hydroplaned once with the eagles and i was really trying   there is also a definite lack of cup holdersmall storage places  the gt has map holders below the speakers in the door but theyre rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or cds max  the center consolestorage binarm rest has 0 cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch but thats it  no change holders  quite a letdown from the sho and the probe is definitely not a peoplemover car or an econobox car

     i was recently thumbing through the 0000 lemonaid new car guide  what i found was a car would be given a recommended under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed in a front end collision  the most highly recommended small car the civic has the worst crash rating of all of the small cars listed  there were many such cases of great vehicles where you wouldnt survive an accident  is it only me or is safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car    
  hello netters  im visiting the us im from sweden in august i will probably rent a chevy beretta from alamo ive been quoted 000 for a week 00 for additional days this would include free driving distance but not local taxes baltimore  they also told me all insurance thats necessary is included but i doubt that  cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more insurance than whats included in the base price but on the other hand he  didnt rent it from alamo  does anyone have some info on this  is 000 a ripoff  no that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city  probability that ill be needing more insurance unless you have an accident you wont need more  if you plan on paying for the car with a credit card check and see if your card automatically covers rental cars  also your own auto insurance may cover rental cars also  most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent and require you to initial in several spots if you dont want it  the credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell  i have never rented from alamo so i dont know if they follow this same practice  is the beretta a good rental car yes  it is a compact 0door probably a bit dull performance and accelerationwise but very adequate  it will have an automatic transmission amfm stereo air conditioning and possibly power  windows and door locks  joe      joseph staudt telxon corp  joestelxoncom po box 0000                usenet is like tetris for people who still akron oh  000000000         remember how to read 000 0000000 x0000                    j heller  
   in a previous article  eric youngblood says  in article apr0000000000000engrwashingtonedu eliotstalfosengrwashingtonedu eliot writes  race car stuff deleted  back to the f0 stuff for a second note that the auto tranny in f0 still shifts at the drivers command not some preselected schedule  the driver still controls the shifting not the transmission    now there is no dispute that in production cars automatics are  inherently more lossy than manuals  that is in theory  my point all  along is that whatever mechanical advantages a manual has over an  automatic can very easily be lost by a driver who isnt skillful or  one thing that gives an automatic an advantage at launch is the fact that it has a torque converter vs a clutch  i know this sounds strange but a torque converter multiplies the engine output when launching  it functions             as a sort of limited continuously variable transmission typically you get  a torque multiplication of 0 to 0 times depending on the stall speed  i have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile  such systems do exist but none are presently installed in production autos that i am aware of  these are commonly called viscous drive cvts or fluidic amplifiers   contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered result is no tq mult  what the convertor does allow is for the engine to be closer to its torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage its driveline  chevy proved it many years ago with the 00 camaro ets and terminal 00 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 0 speed and auto cars  note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can get away with fewer gears than a manual the slip in the convertor makes up for the fewer ratios and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed 0 sspeed autos soon to be out note that some manufacturers are using 0 speed manulas now   once past lauch however the converter begins coupling and the tq multiplication effect is reduced but by then you should be on the cam  correct   al bowers  dod 000  alfa  ducati  hobie  kottke  blad  iaido  nasa well goodness sakesdont you know that girls cant play guitar                                              mary chapincarpenter

   my bbb autoline arbitration experience is over   the outcome was decidedly mixed  i won the battle but  lost the war  the arbitrator found that the car was  defective but decided to offer a repurchase well below  market value   at the time of the hearing average  retail on my truck in the nada book was 00000 but  the decision was for  00000  i wrote a letter to the  council of better business bureaus pointing out the  fact that if you have an automobile that does not  depreciate rapidly the manufacturer has no incentive  to deal with you  there is no way that the  manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and  sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded  a repurchase  the attitude of chevrolets  representative at the hearing tends to support this  point of view  he was totally unprepared and did not  seem to take the proceeding very seriously  i decided to take the repurchase even though i am  getting totally screwed on the price  i will not have  to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon  myself and i have no case for a civil suit based on  the idaho lemon law  i am planning to send a letter to  my elected representatives telling them how utterly  ridiculous the idaho lemon law is  the law allows for  a use deduction equal to the irs mileage allowance   as if chevrolet were buying my gas and paying  for my insurance  summary of the case  in may 0000 i bought a new 00 ton hd chevrolet pickup  between may 0000 and december 0000  this vehicle required repair after repair  systems  that required attention included the transmission  heater fan paint suspension and motor  the main  problem was the five speed manual transmission  they  could not install a nondefective transmission in at  least four attempts  so in summary it is possible to get a repurchase but  you are going to get screwed on the price unless you  paid too much in the first place or if your car  happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly  jackwhpdmd00boihpcom

   i am currently in the car market and would like opinions on a vw passat glx  how does it compare to a toyota camry  i thought the car looked very solid stable and european  only disappointment so far is that that it doesnt offer an airbao my next question is why isnt vw offering automobiles with airbags  should i pay the extra three thousand for a bmw 000 is even though it is smaller and less powerful than than the passat  i think vw got caught out on the airbag thing  its only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature vw assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt requirements for passive restraint but didnt guess that the merican consumer would actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag  vw is really hurting right now in the us market  check out the article in last weeks autoweek about the crisis at vw  golfs and jettas will be coming from the plant in mexico but they dont have the quality at that facility  as per normal vw practice the us launch of the jetta iii is delayed again and again until a good chunk of the useful life of the design is spent  i think that passats come from germany so there is not the same quality and availability issue  its a nice car with a nice engine whether vw will be a player in the us market in two years time is a different question  ill leave the passat  camry flamewar for someone else

  i have a 00 chevy sprint with ac and 0doors its odometer turned 00k and the sensor light started blinking i went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying i need to change the oxygen sensor he said it is to be changed every 00k but since i bought the car when it had 00k i dont know if the same thing happened at 00k and 00k  he quoted 000 for the part and 00 to install it the part cost 00 outside but the mechanic i went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts he suggested i wait till it malfunctions before i do anything  if anyone out there owns a chevy sprint i want to know how they got their oxygen sensors changed also did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealers help also what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction    any help would be greatly apprecisted    thanks        nagesh i have owned my sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every 00k to let you know its time for a check up  when that light goes on i just take it to the delaer tell them its that time and they work on it for 0 hou and you pay 0 for parts and 000 for labor ahhwhat they get for labor i currently have about 00k on my sprint and of all the times i took it in for service i never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the oxygen sensor  what the heck is an oxygen sensor  as far an i know of i have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten now i dont have ac mother nature does that for me   and that might have something to do with it but i still never heard of an oxygen sensor  the only major service job i have had on my car besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job was getting the rotor distributor and gasket replaced  and that was all done within the past 0 months    what i do at 00k is have a good tuneup let them replace what ever they need to pay the bill about 000 and go home and dont worry about the car for another 00k  oh i just remembered something  if that little sensor light bothers you in the fuse box right below the turnsignal lever up against the dash there is a swith on the right side  flip that switch and the light will go off  i do that so that little light wont annoy me  if you cant find it look it up in the car manuel  i hope that i have helped a little and good luck with the oxygen sensor   thomas      email address     give me an an army of west point       tjz0000zeustamuedu     graduates and ill win a battle           give me a handful of texas aggies        creator of mot power     and ill win a war                         gen george s patton                 
     i was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage  what kind of memory is stablereliable enough nonvolatile enough and independent enough of outside battery power to last say 00 years or more in the life of a vehicle  im amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for this length of time especially in light of all the gizmos i work with that are doing good to work for 0 months without breaking down somehow  mk00t00 from thomsom  it has a timekeeper clock and 000 bytes of nvram which has a lithium battery backup  the battery has a life of 00 years of poweroff operation  installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not draw much current  the battery would only be used when your auto battery was dead or had been removed  side question  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles after say 000000000k actual miles  looks like fraud would be fairly easy  for the price of a new odometer you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has  in california they have a line on the transfer of ownership form which states that the odometer mileage is correct  if incorrect you are required to  fill in what you know or guesstimate to be the correct mileage  if you lie on this form and are caught you can be prosecuted and the buyer can sue you for the value of the mileage differential   faster horses younger women older whiskey more money  
  les bartels comments sorry i cant help you with your question but i do have a comment to make concerning aftermarket ac units  i have a frostking or frosttemp forget which aftermarket unit on my cavalier and am quite unhappy with it  the fan is noisy and doesnt put out much air  i will never have an aftermarket ac installed in any of my vehicles again  i just cant trust the quality and performance after this experience   les  let me add my 00 in i had a ac installed by the ford garage and it did not work as well as the ac that was installed by the factory in pickups  identical to mine i have talked to other people that have had the same result dont know if this is just a probable with ford or what  ernie smith  i agree never have the dealer add anything to your car  if you want ac make sure it is factory installedhondas maybe excluded many cant be  bought with ac installed at the factory but i think maybe they actually use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one inas in bigger radiator etcor are designed properly for this in the 0st place anyway my point is the dealer installed ac wont be anywhere near as good as factory and the service bums will mess up your car when installing it scratches screwdriver holes in seatsparts not reinstalled correctly or  with all the screws etc  i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm dealer for 00 yearshe said never have a dealer add anything to your car except maybe floormats

  are there any mr0 owners or motorhead gurus out there that know why my mr0s engine sounds noisy the mr0s engine is noisy at the best of times  but not even a nice nose  its one of those very ugly noises   assuming yours is a non turbo mr0 the gruffness is characteristic of a large inline 0 that doesnt have balance shafts  i guess toyota didnt care about little details like that when they can brag about the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling  myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or recommendation which has an inline 0 larger than 0 liters and no balance shafts  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you ever want a halfway decent engine    if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do except to sell it and get a v0   eliot

  im about to buy a new car and finance some of it  since i paid cash for the last car i bought i did not have to worry about whether or not i had a good amount of insurance on it because of a bank loan  i just put the amount that i wanted not what a bank would have wanted  friends are telling me that banks require some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since it is collateral on loans  is this true  can that insurance be gotten as part of my other insurance  i assume i dont have to pay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance am i correct  i hear about accidenthealth type insurance at the dealers and i am pretty sure these are just money makers for them  i just want to verify that i dont have to buy these at all  or any other types of extras  what do i have to pay for  car tax license  anything else  ellen

   this isnt anything new  back in 0000 i was driving under a high overpass at night on i000 in san diego when i caught a glimpse of someone on the overpass  as i passed under a rock slammed against the metal between the winshield and right front window  my girlfriend was in the seat next to it  i called the police from the next exit but i doubt if they were found  about five years ago in san diego someone was put into a coma from a brick being thrown through his sunroof as he was driving and subsequently crashed  i dont think he ever came out of the coma and i havent heard anything about it for a couple years  i know that this isnt the group for it but since you brought it up does anyone have any idea why they havent bombed the waco cult      probably because there are many children there  also the minor fact that other than defending themselves from 000 some people attacking them they havent threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in years  being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds for a mass murder of koresh and his followers  sorry for posting this to this group but i thought the previous post needed a rebuttal  if you followup to this portion please crosspost and direct followups to a more appropriate newsgroup     boyd johnson   noscspectracomjohnson  san diego california  intermittent newsfeed at best and only to selected groups my opinions certainly dont match those of my employer

   ive a 00 mazda 000 with about 00000 miles on it  recently i do not get  a good feeling of the road esp on a wet pavement when driving the car  it feels as if the car is wandering and there is no grip on the road  the tires are the original ones and have threads on them passes the  penny head test  i had the shocks and struts and alignment checked and  things are fine  however i feel like that i dont have the grip of the  road and feel as if the car is wandering esp on turns  any help  in this is appreciated  thanks    two shots at it 0 check the tires again  if you can see the wear bars youre down to problem area and some tires pass a penny test between the bars  thats no guide at all your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning you may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire  so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road  0 tires age in particular soft tire compounds get harder as you put them thru more heat cycles harder compounds dont grip as well as soft ones effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very often such as in competition but it hits all tires  bob benson

  if im not mistaken altering the odometer is illegal  furthermore i surmise itll be tough to alter bmws odometer if you got at it some of the newer bmws have electronic odometers making it even more tamperproof  on the cars mentioned  0 series from the late 00s the electronic odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer that is driven by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle  these pulses are  converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer  and speedometer no way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage reading  it also means the odometer is just as easy or hard to change as any other mechanical odometer  on the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor and run the car with no speedometer or odometer readinga simple switch will do the job  it also will disable the speed limiter which will enable the car to reach its full speed       alan l peterman                                 0000000000 hm  work                        alqiclabscnraincom its odd how as i get older the days are longer but the years are shorter

  i just ordered a saturn sl0 after considering a few imports frankly the saturn way of doing business and service was a very big plus i hadnt bought a new car since i bought my honda 0wd back in 00 and i was unbelieveably offended by most salespeople i met  saturn was indeed very different i made three different visits to the dealer where i bought my car and was never pressured saturn also had the best aftersales support and the fixed pricing made it very easy for me to decide exactly what i wanted to buy another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer hes been fixing imports for 00 yearsand bought a saturn based on what hes seen and heard from his customers   saturn also has a good extended warranty program 000 for 0 year00k miles  fully refunded if you dont use it that works out to an actual cost of 000 or so based on the 0 year treasury rates using savings account rates its more like 000 in the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work without counting against the refund  mike

  the older ny taxis were made by the checker car company and i would love to have one or is the checker car company still in business  checker motors went out of business in 0000  its hard to get old checkers that are worth restoring since almost every one was a fleet vehicle that was driven into the ground  if you can get a  body in decent shape the mechanicals should all be available somewhere   checker used whatever parts were around  for instance i had a chevy straight six and a gmc truck radiator and a ford rear in mine   the model that i am looking for is the checker marathon  actually you want a checker special if you can find one  good luck  im sorry i let mine go

  joni ciarletta writes  my honda accord just hit the magic 000000 mile mark and now  all sorts of things are beginning to go bad the latest problem  i am experiencing is with my brakes  they still stop the  car fine but once i am stopped completely my brake pedal  will sink another 0 or 0 inches all by itself  if feels really  strange and i am worried my brakes will quit working one of  these days    i checked my brake fluid and the reservoir was full but the  fluid itself looked really dirty like dirty oil  i called  my mechanic and he told me i need a new brake master cylinder  which will cost me a whopping 000000  you are not alone  my 00 honda accord with 000000 miles on it started   showing the same behavior  i replaced the brake master cylinder myself  it took about an hour and cost   about 00  sure beats paying 000 to have someone else do it  if i wanted to   rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one it would   have cost only 00 to 00 for the rebuild kit  the honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to  two bolts attach it to the   engine compartment  two brake lines enter the master cylinder  the tricky   part was that the brake lines were stuck tight  my craftsmen open end wrench   rounded off the bolt heads  i had to use vise grips to loosen those suckers    wow  best invention since sliced bread  after that it was very easy  bolt   the new part in place add new brake fluid and bleed the brakes  this is quite easy even for a beginner  my local auto parts store had a repair   manual for the honda accord it had detailed diagrams of the master brake   cylinder and a stepbystep procedure for replacing it

     after many trips to the dealer who has admittedly been patient with me they are admittedly going to do nothing about it the dealer did however follow the bulletin and review proper shifing procedures with the owner my next attempt at satisfaction in the customer 000 number but from the first round it doesnt sound too hopeful   im surprised i know of a local case where a guy took his saturn back five times to complain they hadnt properly eliminated a rattling noiseso saturn gave him a new car  call that 0000 number

  i know this is the wrong place to post this but i couldnt find any relevant newsgroups in my area  for those of you who are from pa where is vascar where the cops measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance between two white lines on the road right most commonly used  im especially interested in the pittsburgh area specific locations prior experiences if possible  for those pa and nonpa if they use vascar in your state is it most common in rural city highway areas etc  what im interested in mainly is where i can speed with the least risk of being caught  you can always detect radar but theres no way to fight vascar unless you know where all the white lines are  thanks a lot      arun jayakumar

  ive had a valentine for about 0 months now and i agree that it is the best det ector available the point here is trust and reliability ive been able to tr ust the valentine more than any other detector ive owend if the valentine sa ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me then its mo re than likely to be a speed trap with my other detectors ive gotten so many  falses that ive begun to ignore someo of the warnings because i didnt want t o drive like i had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal  that directional indicator really really helps plus more info is almost alwa ys better than less info no matter how smart radar detectors get the human br ain is usually smarter so if im going to make a decisio based on information  at hand i want all the info i can get plus if you divide the overall streng th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported youll find that each bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat with other detectors yo ull just get one strong warning my logic may be faulty on this but i think i t works okay  although i must admit that i havent really noticed the reflection problem of one radar souce  thomas  
  i agree with gaia even though the saturn has proved to be a very reliable car so far a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind  in my opinion getting the powertrain warranty is enough in my case thats be cause anything that needed repairing in the interior sunroof windows doors  etc i could do myself i just didnt want to mess with the engine and such  plus i think the extra 0 years of 00hour roadside assistance must be worthe so meting i opted for the 0 year plan for 000  thomas

   im not familiar with the trannies used in winston cup but in the transam  cars ive played with the  transmissions were the racing variety with  dog clutches instead of sychros  in a transmission with dog clutches the  gears are always  engaged with each other and moving the dog clutches  engages the gears to the shafts  motorcycle transmissions are the same way  shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause  transmission damage the only question being how long it  takesto grenade  something for the trans in my 00  pulsar se it was  about 00k miles but  it had a weak  tranny in the first place    just out of curiosity how is this dog clutch any different from a synchro  transmission  what you described sounds the same to me  in fact what little  ive studied on trannies the instructor referred to the synchros as dogs  and said they were synonymous  the gears are always meshed in a synchronized  gearbox and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting or at least  that is what i was taught  explain por favour  motorcycle transmissions dont have synchros  the engagment dogs are very corse and sloppy  there are maybe 000 teeth dogs on the side of the gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back and forth  to shift  start to apply pressure at the same time the clutch is pulled the clutch is a hand lever and shift quickly  if  you try a slow lazy shift it will grind you just have to pop it into the next gear before it has a chance to grind  there isnt a neutral between gears obviously there is but you cant select it with the shifter so double clutching is not a possibility  speed shifting which is what i have always heard clutchless shifting called works pretty well for upshifts with some practice but i usually use the clutchespecially for the lower gears  i think auto as in automobile trannys are similar except that the engagment dogs are very fine with no slop  and the addition of syncho rings  the gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions that are synchronized but may not be in nonsynchro gears reverse and sometimes first     frank ball   0urm          frankbsadhpcom    000 0000000 work hewlett packard             000 0000000 fax  000 0000000 home 0000 valley house drive     it000 xt000 seca 000 00 f000 pl000 rohnert park ca 000000000  kc0wug law ama dod 0000 im the nra

  im considering switching to geico insurance   i got numerous complaints about geico and several helpful pointers to other good insurance companies  i have decided to go with the erie insurance exchange which seems to combine high ratings from the net and consumer reports with low rates at least for me  thanks for all the responses  
   i have tested both vehicles identically equipped both for weeklong periods curiously and consider these are test vehicles i found the mercury higher in build quality than the nissan  either choice is good but beware that i did not experience reasonable mileage with the v0  average city driving was 00mpg with about 00 avg on the highway  both were optioned to the hilt the nissan had leather  the villager was in the 00k range and the nissan was over 00k  bob

  subject dealer cheated me with wrong odometer reading need help  here is a story  i bought a car about two weeks ago  i finally can get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence history of the car  in between 00 and 00 the instrument pannel  of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero  therefore the true meter reading is the reading before replacement plus current mileage  that shows 00000 mile difference comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from  the  dealer never told me anything about that important story  i hope that i can return the car with full refund  do u think this is possible  does anyone have similar experiences  any comments will be appreciated  thanks  something that happened in south africa about a year ago a dealer sold a  mercedes with an odometer reading of 000k kilometers to a lady turned out  that the actual reading should have been 000k court case followed because lady said she wouldnt have bought a car with that much kms dealer found  quilty fined and had to take back the car  i think you have a case if you can get a sworn statement from the previous owner take the car back to the dealer and threaten him or something   gerrit

  hi i need your help with a problem i have with a 0000 mitsubishi galant gs transmission  the car has a 0 speed manual tranmission since the car was bought new while shifting from 0nd to 0rd  unless  i do it slowly and carefully it makes a popping or hitting sound the dealer and mitsubishi customer service reached by an 000  say  this is normal for the car  is it and about a year ago at 00kmiles the stick shift handle got stuck while attempting to put it in reverse    0 the shifter would not budge  the clutch had no effect    0 the front tires would not budge even when the clutch is       fully depressed    0 if the clutch is released the engine would die    0 assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was       stuck i could not make the car move  it acted as if       it were in neutralexcept for dying when clutch is released    0 i finally was able to release the shifter by having        someone rock the car back and forth less than an inch       while i depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter    0 the shifter acted normally after that  when this happened i took it to the dealer they checked the  clutch it was ok they checked the transmission it was ok  i had the exact problem a couple of months ago and again last week  the dealer says there is nothing they can do because  mitsubishi the 000  says they have never heard of the problem and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car   in all three occurances the car was parked head first in a garage and since the front wheels were stuck the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter hence temporarily solving the problem  and the dealer and mitsubishi refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck  i know there is smething wrong with the transmission shifting  from 0nd to 0rd and getting stuck at random but i cant get  the dealer to fix it i need your help with the mechanical problems  and with how to handle mitsubishi   all hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated and sorry to bore you with the long post  thanks rabih   try another dealer  sometimes the sophistication of equipment etc is better at one dealer than another  you may also find another dealer willing to help you with the problem   joe

  for a reasonable sum you can get a bmw with traction control a torquesensing limited slip rear differential    traction control as far as the optional feature that one buys with cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential  a torque sensing differential is a type of lsd but not all lsds are torque sensing  viscous coupled differentials as opposed to viscous couplings are rotational sensing not torque sensing for that matter so are traction control systems that use abs sensors and pulse braking  then there are the older positracs and whatever which i am not familiar with the workings   eliot

  i just ordered a saturn sl0 after considering a few imports frankly the saturn  stuff deleted  saturn also has a good extended warranty program 000 for 0 year00k miles  fully refunded if you dont use it that works out to an actual cost of 000 or so based on the 0 year treasury rates using savings account rates its more like 000 in the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work without counting against the refund mike  in general extended warranties are a ripoff  this 0yr00k is really only 0yr00k because you get the 0yr00k one free with the car  also is there perhaps a deductible you pay each and every time you use the warranty also are certain items excluded from coverage on the extended warranty and if you use it at year 0 for some 00 buck job and pay a 00 deduct and then you have used it so no refund ever again extended warranties are ripoff high profit items for the dealer

  yes i saw a 000 turbo quattro wagon on i000 in nj on monday  i thought audi stopped selling wagons in the us after the 0000  this is exactly the type of vehicle i would like to own  i bet its price is 00 times my car budget  think again  thanks to 00 minutes tick tick tick used 000 quattros are bargains 00s go for about 00k 00s go for perhaps 0 or 0k more the 00 valve 00s are quite a bit more because of an enormous hp and torque gain i think they go for about 00 to 00k if you can find one  i have seen quite a lot of 0000 000 quattros not that many wagons though at the dealer lot they use very high quality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized so it will never rust  in short typically a 0 yr old 000 looks no more older than a 0 year old and the 0 bangers are bullet proof engines  000k out of one is not rare even for a turbo which is watercooled for the 000s  then there are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost  if you are into luxogizmos the cars are loaded with just about everything too  the price of parts is a different story though   eliot  
  here is a story  i bought a car about two weeks ago  i finally can get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence history of the car  in between 00 and 00 the instrument pannel  of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero  therefore the true meter reading is the reading before replacement plus current mileage  that shows 00000 mile difference comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from  the  dealer never told me anything about that important story  i hope that i can return the car with full refund  do u think this is possible  does anyone have similar experiences  any comments will be appreciated  thanks  this is a tricky situation if the previous owner didnt inform the dealer of the odometer change then the previous owner committed fraud and he may be liable the dealer may also be liable if the previous owner notified the dealer or if the previous owner had the  dash replaced at a dealer or if the previous owner had the dash changed  legally any records search on the car should turn up the fact that the odometer had been altered  if a dealer changes the speedometer he has to report it it goes into the cars service record with the manufacturer and on the title if i remember correctly the dealer told me that the old mileage etc were sent to ford when my tbirds speedo  was replaced if the odometer can be set to the old mileage it must  be if it cant eg electricallydriven odometers then the mileage  of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is  affixed to the door frame of the vehicle   either way if the change had been done legally then a records search which the dealer almost certainly did should have turned it up  call your states department of transportationpublic safetymotor vehiclesor your tag agentto find out for certain what your rights are your states attorney general will know for certain   james  james p callison    microcomputer coordinator u of oklahoma law center  callisonuokmaxecnuoknoredu       callisonaardvarkucsuoknoredu    disclaimer im not an engineer but i play one at work the forecast calls for thunder00 tbird sc    its a hell of a thing killing a man you take away all he has  and all hes ever gonna have  will munny unforgiven

   in a previous article jimfcenterlinecom jim frost says  jnielsenmagnusacsohiostateedu john f nielsen writes  in article 0r0jr0m0varmorycenterlinecom jimfcenterlinecom jim frost writes tcorkumbnrca trevor corkum writes i figure that 00mph collisions into brick walls arent common enough for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there are lots of lowspeed collisions that do worry me  get into an 00 mph accident and you may reconsider ive been in one and it is really scarey my life is something i value more than a cars looks or handeling consider it insurance it may not happen often but when it does youll sure be glad you got a safe car  granted the tests arent perfect but id much rather be in a car that did well in the test than a car that did horribly   you raise a valid point but again its a tradeoff  how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection  you could buy a volvo saab or benz and get really good crash protection and other luxuries but youll pay significantly more for it  in my case its out of the question because all of those cars are beyond my budget  ive been in two major auto accidents both were multiple car  the worst was a headon three car collision t intersection and one person ran a stop sign  in both cases i was stopped and had no place to go and i saw it coming both times   even in highspeed headon collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old 0point seatbelt  nowadays at least in the us you get an airbag if you get a 0point belt so presumably you get an added safety benefit there as well  thats something i certainly look for and which can be had in inexpensive cars  if you really want to add safety to any car simply add a cage to the car  they are available and cheap about 000 in the usa  add to that four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that were otherwise not survivable  but instead of people spending a little extra money we get legislation that says the govt must mandate a minimal level of protection for everyone   one other significant factor in improving ones own safety is to get some training  this will improve your safety more than any other single investment will  driveride defensively and that does not mean you have to be a doddering old stick in the mud  people here tend to enthuse about autos more than the average probably in the top 00th percentile in driving ability but still we sometimes overlook the obvious  ive been to two driving schools and three riding schools for my motorcycle  a very worthwhile investment and besides it was a lot of fun too    safety is what you make of it just because a carmaker doesnt provide you with an adequate level of protection doesnt mean you have to leave it go at that      al bowers  dod 000  alfa  ducati  hobie  kottke  blad  iaido  nasa well goodness sakesdont you know that girls cant play guitar                                              mary chapincarpenter

   does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a bmw after changing the oil yourself  also i have about 0000 miles on my 000i and so far only one of the five yellow service indicators went out that means i dont need oil service until it reach approximatly 00000 miles which doesnt make sense to me any idea  ps of cause i did my first oil change at 0000 miles    derek

   as a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the us while   here in europe they are rare just wondering  in many of our cities there are traffic signals every 000 feet unsynchronised of course well here in ottawa anyway and the roads are so congested that  shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot  also most canadians are too stupid to learn how to shift manually gee i gotta coordinate my two feet on the clutch brake and accelerator and i gotta steer shift and operate the signals optional and radio with my two hands duh it  cant be done  also most north american made cars come with the automatic  as standard equipment so why bother with a manual when the car can shift  for you for no addition money         john kissane                            motorola ireland ltd    oo  uucp     uunetmotcidglaskissanej  mahon industrial estate     internet kissanejglasrtsgmotcom    blackrock cork ireland     u    doug zolmer  internet dwjzbnrca  disclaimer my opinions only   0 0 0 bellnorthern research ltd  ottawa ontario canada                dept 0n00  service control point  routing services design       0 0 r

  they light the highways in texas  funny everywhere else ive been they only light em at junctions  and armadillo crossings  texas is pretty much an edgecase  you cant assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such wideopen spaces  it just aint so  well lets see in just my own personal experience theres nevada new mexico texas wyoming utah south dakota nebraska  minnesota montana florida and parts of louisianna  nobody said lets go into town and drive 000 on main st and you couldnt go that fast on the graveled washboard that passes for highway in some parts  but that only really expensive cars should be driven fast crap is well crap  wr    
   remember roads in america are not designed for speeds above 00 meaning they would be safe at 0000 roads like the autobahn are smoother straiter wider and slightly banked   example a few months back i was traveling late at  night  000 am or so and i was changing highways at a bent crosssing it  curved off to the south east becoming hidden by trees after about 0000 ft and continued to the left strait north i wanted to turn north checked the south lane rolled into the crossing and checked the north lane nevertheless there wasnt  a car in sight so i took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane now my car isnt a 0 sec 000 performer but i was in the corect lane and  over 00 in decent time even at 000 i wasnt wasting time it was then that i checked my mirror and saw a mustang closing in my lane fast he  had just turned the corner and was just noticing me luckly he saw me and  changed lanes in time i estamate he was moving in excess of 00 or so i was just a by stander i had no chance of runing from him or moving out  of his way im glad he saw my brake lights in time i shudder to  think of what would have happened had i wainted to pull out and not  left the time he needed to dodge me  rule just because your car can do 000 and  your way is clear dont assume it will stay that way               travis disclamer the ideas expressed above are in fact the same as                          my employer since i have none             email flame at  marshattfeserveccpurdueedu         
   hello   i have a 00 toyota 0x0 and in the last few weeks i have been getting quite a few dings  in the paint on the hood from rocks and debris off of the road i have never had any major problems with other cartrucks in the past maybe a ding once in a while i went to the dealer and he said that it happens all of the time and he recomended putting a bug deflector on the hood he said that the trucks for some unknown reason seem to have this problem more than some cars   it seems to me that either my luck is really bad or there might be a problem with the paint painted on a monday morning perhaps    how well do these bug deflectors work for small road debris on trucks    if anyone has any experiencessuggestions please let me know thanks   greg    thornwamumdedu  
  im wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter ive been doing it my self over 000000 miles on my current toyota truck ive got over 000k ive heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission my experiences suggest otherwise what techniques do you use  on some old pieces of junk i drove the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift except clutchless to date ive driven rabbits datsuns comets fords  a chevy some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker  easier they where to shift  my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever if for some reason i miss the shift window i lightly press the accelerator  try agian ive found that clutchless shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms 00000000 i also skip gears some times using 000 0000   krispy

  im having an interesting problem with my girlfriends car  before i delve into its innards i thought id check netwisdom on the subject   its a 0000 buick skyhawk i knowi know 00l efi 0banger auto 00k miles  when i drive tha car long enough to get it hot especially at highways speeds the transmission has this nasty habit of getting stuck in 0rd gear  as a result when you stop for a light the motor stalls  putting the car in park and waiting for 0000 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to reset and go back into 0st  otherwise it just stalls when put in drive    my thoughts  either it the 0rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot not so likely or perhaps the lockup converter is not disengaging properly seems likely  the least likely keeping fingers crossed is that some critical vacuum hose has brokencracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere as used to happen with old modulator valves  my background is that my father owns a service station and i worked there on and off from 0000 years of age  please feel free to be as technical as you want   id appreciate hearing any tipssuggestionsoffers of free beer grin  skoal  chris

   better still years ago they demonstrated a cold air system which only used air it was called a rovax the unit worked very well the short coming was the seal technology where is it today  actually the company and the product was rovac  which stood for rotary air conditioningit used a rotary compressor with what was effectively an airair heat exchanger and worked pretty well the negatives were mostly that it was about 000 less efficient than using freon and noise problems from the high velocitypressure air all of which were solved by the time the company went bankrupt  it is still a legal entity in florida but i believe completely dead and theres a heck of an opurtunity to buy up its patents and restart the operation     alan l peterman                                 0000000000 hm  work                        alqiclabscnraincom its odd how as i get older the days are longer but the years are shorter

    but they can put out a lot of particulate matter  i heard something about legislation being discussed to clean up diesel emissions  is there anything in the works to install scrubbers for diesels  how about the feasibility of installing them on trucks and cars  would it be any different than a catylitic converter  id assume easier since were removing particulate matter instead of converting gasses  lets hear peoples opinions  the technology cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer ca emissions laws involves three things i know of  0 all compliant diesels are turbocharged 0 all use an aftercooler which cools the air which was heated    by compression by the turbocharger up to about 00 psi 0 a gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air    intake and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is    low  no scrubbers catalytic converters etc are used  the path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free  interestingly except for the lowpressure fuel limitation power output  and mileage are enhanced by these measures  one can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power lots more power and these are approved by the carb  dan hepner

     hi   ive been seeing all these articles about changing  brake fluid and i am wondering if this is really necessary  i have an 00 toyota corolla sr0 with 00000 and i am in the  only if you want to stop seriously though every 0 years you should have this done brake fluid absorbs water over time the water becomes steam when the fluid gets hot and steam compresses youll also have better luck with the longevity of master cylinder calipers and brake lines  jeff goss  
  when do the new mbenz c class cars come out the new nomenclature that mb has adopted will it only apply to the c class cars or will it also apply to the current s class cars does any one know what will replace the current 000 class since the c class will be smaller and more in line with the current 000  another question is bmw realising a new body style on the current 0 series and 0 series they seem to be a bit dated to me  
  there are two crank configurations for the flat 0 the most common one is probably the crank that is very similar to the i0 crank  which flat 0 engines have i0 style cranks    comparing those two engines the i0 and the flat 0 have no first order shaking forces or rocking moments  the i0 has a second order shaking force while the flat 0 has a second order rocking moment  the significant thing about the flat 0s second order moment is that it can be easily balanced out by adding mass at the ends of the crank  the i0 however requires a counter rotating shaft with mass to balance out the second order forces  i am 0000 sure that subaru and porsche use the boxer configuration and not the inline 0 crank that you analyzed and compared would you care to reevaluate the other case of a flat four  i think that this configuration is perfectly balanced as far as primary secondary forces and couples are concerned  i have an article in front of me that says so  bottom line  the biggest difference between the engines would probably be their intended use  the flat 0 is easier to fit under low hoods and in rear compartments for mid or rear mounting  the i0 can be mounted transversely to reduce hood length read cab forward other than that there isnt much fanfare to the differences between them no matter what subaru ads say  technology shared with porsche  indeed  the flat four is also shorter than an inline 0 so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length and a longitudinal placement is easier for a 0 wheel drive drivetrain  i think that subarus ads hold water  in practice their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline 0s and completely buzz free though some may not like its peculiar note  but as alfa has shown a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach   eliot  
     there is another advantage with manuals you can start the car by pushing it  and shifting into second gear this doesnt work with an automatic    peter    just for the record read your owners manual before attempting a push start most manufacturers today do not recommend this i think the catalytic converter is the primary reason  unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when the converter gets into its operating range  the best reason for a manual because you like to drive one i find that its much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car remember pay  attention out there  stupidity behind the wheel has still taken more people to the morgue than drunk driving the problem is that we dont revoke peoples license for stupidity  jeff goss  
       flat  000 deg v  horizonatlly opposed    usually it also equals boxer however i think the term is  traditionally reserved for 0s and 00s and firing order matters  this was talked about here in ra many months back i cant remember  the consensus    examples    ferraris 000tr is a flat 00 boxer  porsches 000 is a flat 0  subarus impreza is a flat 0    regards    brian   bmws boxer twin no two wheelers here been around since 0000 i think the other examples are johnny come latelies i may be wrong so no flames please  jeff goss  
  examples  ferraris 000tr is a flat 00 boxer porsches 000 is a flat 0 subarus impreza is a flat 0  i think you got it the other way round the ferrari flat 00 is a 000 degree v00 and not a true boxer while the subaru and porsche are true boxers  dont know about the vw bug though but i suspect that it is also a true boxer  eliot

  folks  i am going to be purchasing a new vehicle in the next few months  i am trying to hold out until the fall since i have heard that i can be in a better negotiating position to purchase a 00 right when the 00s are coming out  i need something that can comfortably carry 0 adults 0 kids in car seats and 0 00pound dogs  i can probably afford something in the 00k00k range  i am interested in the suvs but am not sure there are any that are decent which i can afford i think the ford explorer got good reviews from consumer reports but is above my  range  the isuzu rodeo is probably in my price range but i think consumer reports gave it a big thumbs down  can anyone offer any suggestions  i am hoping for something a little more hip than the traditional wagon and the suvs look like fun we do a lot of camping too  veek

   on the subject of the upcoming new mustang  i do not put much stock in the mag rags inside information or even ford rep quotes  the taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in its entirety  inside information had the taurus with a v0 and rearwheel drive at one point  i wouldnt look for a simple repaneled mustang folks you may be cheating yourself if you do  theres a lot of potential  ford hasnt released a new car without a 0wheel is in 0 years  the mustang project has been brewing for at least 0 right  a 0wheel is could happen  those modular v0s are out there too  in the interest of cafe and competition dont rule those out either   your ignorant if you do and there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there who really knows what itll look like  the mach iii  doubt it highly  the next mustang will be fords highest profile car  it attracts way more attention than the camarofirebird because its heritage is more embedded in the general public  dont lie to yourself and believe ford will forfeit that   the car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my car circle is that the  suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current cobra but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior after the mn00 thunderbird cost and weight debacle ford decided  independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive wont be tried again in  a volume car    the current 00l v0 will soldier on for about two years  a version of the 00 valve modular v0 in the mark viii could be offered then  ford is spending big money tooling up for 00l and 00l v0 engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future and therefore probably do not consider volume production of 000 hp v0 engines a priority   undisguised the car looks ok but not nearly as exciting as the new camarofirebird imo    i suspect ford will produce their car with higher quality than gm will  achieve with the camaro firebird  the way gm loses money the temptation to just get them out the door for the sake of positive cash flow will be  great once demand really takes off    tim gardner

   much discussion about economics of safety deleted  safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car i wont buy a  small car like a civic or whatever  great  safety  handling  speed    for me  seems to me that you would be more dead in a small car than a large car  after an accident  this is a very simplistic view of safety assuming that you are in a collision less likely with a more agile smaller car then the important factor is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you this is why a thousand pound f0 car can hit a wall at 000 and the driver walks out and why everybody dies when a suburban hits a wall at 00 as i recall for the last generation suburban hic numbers   as an aside just what is the point of an airbag it seems to me that seatbelts with pretensioners audi et al or a good tight 0 point belt  will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag you might be  saved from some flyign glass or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are wearing no seat belt   craig   gerrit     
   you guys are correct  the bricklin was produced in canada the national museum of science and technology here in ottawa has one and sometimes they put it on display  most of the time it stays in storage because the museum doesnt have much room its a big deal for a car to be canadian and thats why they  have it  if anybodys a fan they also have a nice green 00 riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom   mike harker ottawa ontario canada voice 0000000000   paul tomblin formerly ptgeovisiongvccom svens law theres exceptions to every law except this one

  i have both an 00 and an 00 camry each with manual 0speed transmissions the 00 has about 000000 miles on it and the 00 about 00000 miles  about a year ago i found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the 00 was         leaking fluid around the piston seal leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car  i pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit new plunger seal etc and thought i had the problem licked  much to my surprise the same problem developed several months later  this time i looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches burrs or other obvious causes of the problem  i didnt find any  ever since i have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system  i knew i would be selling the car and didnt want to go all the way to solving the problem  i should add that the clutch is original and that ive had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch  my hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal the angle of the piston rod attached to the pedal is off the axix of the cylinder thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it  what do you think of that as an explanation  can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in  now the 00 same problem except that the above diagnosis doesnt explain why all of the fluid leaked out by way of the master cylinder into the passenger compartment while i was on vacation for 00 days during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort  what can you suggest here  many thanks  lets hope i dont end up going to click and clack on this  bill christensbarry ceruleanaccessdigexcom

  the sound he describes is common to any older toyota engine i ever heard i dont know the relevance of his observations about oil changes my simply makes noise not all that annoying mind you but you hear it well when the engine is right behind your left ear   i think those with 00 mr0s would describe the engine as sweet if a little loud those with 00 mr0s i cant imagine any unbiased person paying it any compliments  sounded like my exdormmates rusty chevy chevette  with the 00 i would want to redline it just for the music with the 00 i would short shift so that it would shut up  the new camry 00 features balance shafts  i guess since the mr0 is getting the axe it is too late for them to do anything about this  it is no mystery that the turbo mr0 is only 0 liters the engineers had enough integrity to prevent any further abuses  also in europe the mr0 mk0 nonturbo was also only 0 liters as usual the undiscriminating american market if it is japanese it must be good gets the dogs to be fair we also got the turbo which the europeans did not    eliot    
  jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says  can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc  some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented  about this problem but i havent seen it happen on my 0 month old  00 probe gt  i think this may be something that ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars  also someone said that ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it  i have had my probe looked at twice by my local dealer where i purchased the car  the first time they made this problem worse  the second time after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my fordprobe mailing list they said they didnt know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and made it much better  however it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough roads and still squeals when i openclose the window in wet weather anyone elsess do this  ford only gives 0 key with the car  cmon ford spend an extra few pennies  i got two keys with my car but only one remoteentry pushbutton thingie but then i bought my 00 with 0000 miles and  i think it may have been a repossession  so im not surprised something was missing   horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference  i am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where it describes the procedure to follow if you discover something on your ford that could  cause  serious injury  threaten lives  etc  something about notifying the national traffic safety group as well as ford  those little youvegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep buttons are terrible  the latter is probably because of the air bag  its pretty much takes up all the space where youd expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns  well i guess thats good in a way but in a way its bad  when someone hears that kind of horn they expect to see a big american car  they may not associate the sound with a small jap car style car like the probe is  tires fling dirtmud onto side of car  yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes  the mudflaps help a lot  transmission the 0 speed is a must  i have always been a 0speed guy  almost every car ive ever owned has been a 0speed  because i got a good deal on this car with the 0000 miles i knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic  but it is a pretty hightech automatic  it is a fully electronicaly controlled 0speed with torque converter lockup  even with the automatic im getting 00 mpg on the highway driving 0000    but of course driving  00 is illegal so i  probably made that sentence up       around town the mileage has been around 0000 not bad for an automatic   of course it doesnt have the control of a 0speed but since i do a lot of city driving it turns out to be very convenient  its nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time although that too is illegal here in  weliketocontrolyourlife massachusetts    no shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still  shakes and rattles has been my main gripe  ive gotten them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older  tires 00000vr00 goodyear eagles 00 left hoping for 00k   on my 00 probe gl i got about 00k out of the original goodyears and had driven the replacement tires bridgestone 00k miles when i tradeed the car  the 0000000vr00 firestones on my 00 probe look like theyre designed for performance ie rather wide shallow tread etc so they probably wont last as long  but the car handles very very very well  it sticks to the road like glue even on a rough surface  interior is very very nice too  very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound  definitely  fordmazda did a very very nice job on this one  the car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it  yes this cars stiff suspension isnt for everyone  i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car id strongly suggest looking into the mx0  having driven an 00 probe for 0 years i find the 00 suspension interesting the car actually drives much better than the 00  it is a very firm ride and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road  yet the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads  you hear and feel the bumps yet the car retains its posture very well  if you have 0 passengers by all means bring them along too  theyll find that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides differently if thats better is up to you    well i wouldnt encourage passengercarrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash  as mentioned in the consumer reports writeups consider the back seat as a parcel shelf  no biggie to me though if it had been id not have bought the car  but its definitely not a family car  also theres a lot of glass around you which i wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer  ac is a must on any probe from 00  00  the 00 in particular sends out a real blast of cool air when the ac is on max  that lots of glass you mentioned is what gives the car the very good visibility reports you see in all the writeups  most sportssporty cars dont have that good visibility  ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i havent heard about this one  i know that some of the very early probes 00 and maybe 00 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which  the complaints ive heard re exhaust system on 00s have been on  the gt  of course being a different engine that is a differeent  exhaust system  i was one of those with an 00 who qualified for the free replacement since i had already replaced the muffler when i received the notice  i wasam due a refund from ford  i applied in february and am still waiting     gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car  i was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering that i was expecting the worst from them  yes  i was pretty amazed when i had my car in for some touchup adjustments this past week and they had to keep it overnight too busy for them to get to it and they offered to pay for a rental  they  did make me pay for taxes and insurance though   from what ive heard it sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems with  the probe and probably mx0 when they first went into production but  i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point  thats almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though  i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm  but i seriously feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well    bill heiser    heiseracsbuedu heiserworldstdcom                boston university boston ma     
  tommy szeto writes  water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friends 00 ford probe  every  once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water  under the plywoodcarpet cover on the trunk  i would guess this usually   i noticed this is my 00 probe also when recently cleaning out the back  i   think the water is coming up through some rubber stoppered holes beneath the   spare  mine looked slightly worn and there was no water or water damage  i have the same problem with my 00 probe  the water is definitely not comming up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare  i have to remove the rubber stopper to drain the water  seems like a common problem with probe  there is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of 00 probes complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals  it is a known problem present on most if not all pre00 probes so you  shouldnt have to pay them to fix it  in my case they fixed it on my extended warranty i just had to pay a 00 deductable the work was valued at something like 000 with labor and parts  having removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions i think their estimate was fair     bill heiser    heiseracsbuedu heiserworldstdcom                boston university boston ma

   probably the most famous v00 is the one cadillac made from about 0000   to 0000  they had to scale down then because the great depression really put   the crimp on luxury cars  it had 000 cubic inches with over two hundred horse   power  they dont make them like they used to   there were others though  packard had one until about 0000 whe it down   sized to their legendary twinsix their mainstay for the next twenty years    lincoln and pierce arrow might have also had one but i am not two sure most luxury and semiluxury cars of this era at least experimented with   v00 if they did not actually produce them  there was actually a cylinder war   among the big three to see who could produce the biggest engine  big m   standard disclaimer applies because i cant think of anything wittier  
  review of 0000 ford taurus sho  by gene kim   background      last week i bought a 0000 ford taurus sho moving up from driving a 0000 toyota celica st and a 0000 oldsmobile cutlass  i have been interested in buying a sho for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in denver and chicago every week  i bought a remarkably clean maroonred sho with 00k miles on it for 0000 as far as i can tell this is about 0000 under blue book and i still have another 0000 miles before the extended service plan runs out      as one should with any pre0000 shos i made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments however my sho does not have the newer rod shifter  i understand i can get this for 000 from any ford service center  in addition the car received the full tuneup at 00k miles receiving new platinum plugs and valve adjustment      for a car with 00k miles on it the car was virtually immaculate the clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents although the front airdammolding was covered with lots of small scratches  not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the highway      having driven a smaller twodoor coupe for so long i was a bit concerned about whether i could get used to driving a larger car  to my surprise the size of the car doesnt bother me at all  it seems just as nimble as my celica  no comparisons with my oldsmobile   visibility from the drivers seat is excellent helped mostly by of the small the quarterwindows aft of the backseat door windows and in front of the cpillar and rear window  parallel parking is a bit more difficult but other than that i love the size      in fact im starting to appreciate the large trunk as i pack up for a 00hour drive to washington dc for the summer  more on the ride later in this review   engine          as with anyone even slightly interested in shos i was very interested in the 00valve 00l yamaha shogun engine  i was not disappointed  base performance of the engine under 0000 rpms is good  you can even do reasonable launches from second gear although i dont make a practice of this  the engine revs smoothly and eagerly  tooling around town does not require many shifts  this is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car more on this later      while the performance of the engine under 0000 rpms may be unremarkable it undergoes a jekyllhyde transformation once you hit higher revs  at 0000 rpms a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open up  the engine soars to its 0000 rpm redline and you are treated to in my opinion the sweetest sounding v0 around the engine inexplicably sounds overjoyed to be at 0000 rpm      ive noticed that when i drive around town i constantly watch the tach to see how far below 0000 rpm i am  to go from 0000 rpm to 0000 you may have to punch the accelerator  while torque is more than adequate it doesnt come fully online until those other 00 valves are used   transmission      when car and driver first reviewed the car in 0000 they marvelled at how ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car  i remember driving a friends parents sho in 0000 and remember thinking about whether i had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic  the clutch was that stiff  that was back then      the entire clutch assembly on my sho has been replaced under a ford recall in 0000  the clutch on the sho feels no stiffer than the one on my toyota celica  in fact the friction point seems a bit larger and more forgiving      when playing with the shifter with the car parked the shifter felt very reasonable  the 00 and 00 gates were where youd expect it to be and the shifting action was smooth  on the road its much the same  but you have to shift slowly  make no mistake its a clumsy shifter      when hurrying shifts like when i was initially trying to impress friends i consistently miss the 00 shift often grope clumsily for the 00 shift and sometimes even muff the 00 shift  i find this pretty amazing in a car like this      it also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your time  seems obvious but compared to my toyota and my friends honda this seems atrocious and clumsy someone on recautos noted that crxs should blow shos offtheline because of the incredibly clumsy shifter      i now shift much more sedately and the shifter seems more reasonable  when you play within these bounds the shifter works smoothly with no surprises  i dont know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all      along these same lines i initially had trouble shifting gears smoothly  again slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely  this took several days for me to get the hang of  i think some of my problems were because ive never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher gears      occasionally i have trouble shifting into reverse  the shifter refuses to enter the gate and i often grind the synchros trying to  get it into gear  ill be watching this carefully in the next couple of months      a quirk  when i upshift and the engine drops back to 00000000 rpm i hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine compartment  not terribly loud but the passenger can definitely hear it  i asked about it when i was looking at the car as do all my passengers  apparently this is a definitely a sho sound and is the gearbox  apparently called gear rollover replies to my queries on recautos are at the end of this review   exterior      as i mentioned before i am astounded by how well the body of this sho has stood up  paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually nonexistent  looking at how older tauri sometimes dont age so gracefully i wonder what the guys at ford did differently to the sho bodies      the body in my opinion is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock tauri  for some odd reason the sho seems different enough from vanilla tauri to get stares at stoplights  of course this could be my overactive imagination   shos get fog lights a more open grille a completely monochromatic exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back with sho stenciled in relief  ive seen a couple shos whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in black  yuck      i dont think the car is flashy  i like it that way  i feel almost anonymous with all those tauri out there but different and distinctive enough to those of us who care     interior      the interior is what really makes me feel like i dont deserve the car  the seats are grey leather the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather and the entire instrument panel is done in a blackgreymetallic scheme        the instrumentation is stock taurus except for the 000 mph speedo and 0000 rpm tach  you get a center console with two cupholders a large compartment under the radio great for a cd player an armrest that contains yet another compartment three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways i think and a compartment for holding cassette tapes  theres mapholders in the doors and an oddly small glove compartment      i spilled a whole can of coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a sink  hey im really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its design  and its a 0000 before the interior was upgraded      the backseat is bigger than any car ive had  why do they need so much space    no smartass comments please        the driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters  from what i hear its not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear mine is no exception  the left side bolster on the drivers has cracked and im not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the way      a big surprise for me  i forgot that shos dont have a normal hand parking brake  instead they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot  too bad  again im getting used to it but it seems a bit anachronistic to me   ride      the suspension is nice and stiff  too stiff  its stiffer than any car ive had  a friends new 0000 toyota celica st seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps better  the sho seems stiffer with less ability to soak up bumps  driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring affair  on the other hand taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesnt flex at all  i listened for that before i bought the car      on the highway the ride is great  when i drove the car from chicago back to purdue i had trouble keeping under 00 mph let alone from trying to see what 000 mph really feels like  its a relatively quiet ride but the sunroof rattles  ive tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there but it seems to be the window that rests on the rails  no easy way to get rid of it i think      over the past three days ive oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too rough  not for me mind you  but i wonder whether i would advise my dad to buy one for himself  but ive discovered as with the shifter if you take your time with shifts youll have no reason to complain  let me explain      the ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the wheels  i feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and right  after i understood this i avoid the limits of traction  and im a happy camper again      its not body rigidity but the composure of the car      as if matching the suspension the steering feel is quite heavy my first impression of driving my sho was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway speeds  it tracks straight as an arrow but when driving around a parking lot the higheffort steering didnt seem so useful  however its reasonable but it doesnt communicate the road to the driver as well as a 0000 ford probe gt  imho its much better than the steering on my celica st      i wonder how bad this car is during winter   miscellaneous notes      gripes      the rattles from the sunroof is intermittent  some days it rattles         loudly other days i look up wondering where all the noise went      activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy  loud squealing as it retracts on its rails  i wonder if there is a quick fix for this again other days it completely disappears  function of humidity      once i made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension and torque steer ive never complained about ride      i wish the seats had more support under the thighs  also i wish the side bolsters would close more tightly        i hear that tires for this car can get really expensive  i currently have goodyear gt0s that cost the previous owner 000 for four      i used to hate the ford stereo systems  whose idea was it to use a volume paddle  now to my amazement i dont really mind  and sometimes think its an okay idea pretty ridiculous though      getting up to 0000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore  but this is no big deal  there is more than enough torque down low      i often goof up the shifting when driving with friends  it took me a couple of days before i could really shift smoothly from 0nd to 0rd gear  hard to believe isnt it      my car has almost 00000 miles on it  my parents noted that it is almost impossible to find a lowmileage sho  astute observation imho  i wonder how long i can make my sho last  i just bought a book titled drive it forever for tips in this department        the goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop  i once parked the car in gear and then accidentally let out the clutch after i started it  the car jolted forward and bounced off the car in front of me  no paint damage at all but starting the car  is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal  also i began  to wonder how strong that brake really is  today i backed out of  parking spot today and started to drive away before i noticed  the glowing brake light  oops      the drivers power window creaks when closed all the way  the same     thing happens in my parents 0000 mercury sable  oddly all the other windows work smoothly       likes      im liking the interior amenities more and more each day  the     cupholders are great      i didnt expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much but it really is handy  you can lock all the doors by pressing the 00 and 000 buttons together  neat  and you can never lock yourself out of the car      i really feel like i dont deserve this car  i really cant believe that i could afford it  i got this car ten years  ahead of schedule        i love this car so much that ive been telling my parents to look into buying one  i love this car so much that i wrote this 00k file  i meant to write a couple of lines and ended up with this        if there were a jd powers survey for used car owners i would have an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this  car  i dont like thinking about getting another car but at this point in time im sure id buy another sho  for under 0000 you cant beat it  next time with an airbag and abs though      insurancewise this car is also a big win  i pay the same premiums as on my 0000 toyota celica  despite that it has nearly twice the horsepower      other odds and ends      much to my amazement there is no sho mailing list anywhere maybe because the sho registry publication has filled this void  i havent joined yet but ive noticed that queries about shos still appear on recautos about once a month  owners of shos are always quick to respond and are very vocal fans of the cars  maybe some of the most vocal on recautos        ive put together the responses to my questions about the cars as well as other posts with useful information on these cars  ill be  posting this in the form of a faq soon        if anyone is interested in starting a mailing list please speak up i dont know if i have the resources here at purdue to start one but  maybe someone out there does   gene kim genekmentorccpurdueedu

     i was recently thumbing through the 0000 lemonaid new car guide  what i found was a car would be given a recommended under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed in a front end collision  the most highly recommended small car the civic has the worst crash rating of all of the small cars listed  there were many such cases of great vehicles where you wouldnt survive an accident  is it only me or is safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car                                                                    imho the best way to reduce risk when operating a vehicle is being able to avoid hazards and for that reason my preferred vehicle is a motorcycle  when i do use a four wheeler my primary reasons are it will keep me dry it will keep me warm or it will carry more cargo  if the four wheeler has as much collision protection as the average motorcycle then it has enough form me  how do you define safe  one definition of safe is without risk  is     chas                         dod 0000  oh how can you be in two places at once when youre not anywhere at all                                                 firesign theatre

  does anybody have any information on the second generation broncos im not talking about bronco iis im referring to the broncos that began production in 0000 based on the f000 chassis i believe  i need to know what to look for can the tops be removed from all models how easily can that be done also what kind of price range should i be looking at ie what is blue book im in college right now and would like a jeep unfortunately ive got a bit of a ride to school and i need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in the springfall i think that the bronco with the removable fiberglass would be a better read bigger choice than a cj0 or cj0  even better anybody in the marylandvirginia area interested in selling one  george howell georgehowellgoucherwb0ffvamprorg

   however if you agree some terms and then when about to sign the dealer slips you a contract with different terms and leads you to believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to that is fraud  there is no 0 day limit on restitution for fraud  you may have to sue and win to get out of this  you will almost certainly have to threaten to sue    on the other hand remember the old adage that a verbal agreement isnt worth the paper its printed on  once you sign you are going to have one hell of a time proving fraud based on a comparison to what you thought you were going to sign   being in the right is one thing proving it is another     brian g gordonbriangsuncom    briangnetcomcom       bgordon0 on genie000000000 on compuservebgordon on aol

  hardly a good reason most us cars do too  and plenty of people buy them in the us anyway  i think the 000 is quite a good looking car  unlike the us influenced 000  kevinhhaslerascomch  i dont think its so easy to tell the 000 from any other 0 or 0 series unless you look real close i really do think volvos are all dogs though beacuse they are 0agricultural   while previous volvos have been essentially very fast tractors the 00 and 0 series are far from agricultural in design or execution how many fwd tractors have you  seen  0have godlier than thou advertising   you state this like it is a bad thing    remember car companies use ad agencies  they dont do their own ads  0are part of renault  is this true  i know that they had done joint ventures with renault but i havent heard about their subsumption into renault  does this mean that the french government now owns volvo   anyway renault makes some very nice cars they just dont sell em in n america   however one thing that i do think is in their favour is that they are immediately recognisable as a volvo and that is not something you can say about most japanese manufacturers and ford saab also have a strong corparate look which like it or not is what i thing all car makers could aim for to make life a little more varied  here here    mperryvnetibmcom  roland rhorwellatcboeingcom      
  i am considering the purchse of a 0000 vw jetta gli with 00k miles on it i recently found out that there are two versions of the gli  0v and 00v i know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same name  the 00v version has 00 more horsepower 0 wheel discs and a standard sunroof  oops thats the difference between the gli 00v and the regular gl  so in addition to the engine what other differences exist between the two models of the jetta gli  more importantly how can i tell which version this one is   there are no badges that said 00v so i am inclined to think that is the 0v version assuming this one the one i looked at is the 0v version is there a valid reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped gl which would cost less  of course i would love to get the 00v version but money talks  please email any responses  thank you peter volpe pv0000albnyvmsbitnet  
  in article 0qn0loc0svelaacsoaklandedu mjepookiepasswayneedu michael j edelman writes the big disadvantage of automatics is the 00 hp they consume that never gets to the wheels  in this respect they are at a disadvantage to a manual  only when the torque converter is not locked up  there are autos out there with converter lock up in 0nd 0rd and 0th gears  dont forget that now that new 0 speed manual trannys are available the drive train is more optimally geared to get the most out of the engine  rare so are 0 speed autos but very real  bottom line is both manuals and automatics have vastly improved  i think that automatics have advanced far more than manuals especially in shift intelligence  i say that a smart automatic is better than the majority of drivers in terms of being in the right gear at the right time which to me is more important than torque converter losses  i prefer the stick for fun and the auto for traffic  who says you cant have your cake and eat it too  a well designed shifter will easily facilitate manual clutchless shifts  i am referring to the much copied mercedes jagged gate  the only department where you lose out is in the number of ratios available and of course the converter losses  if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission it cant be half bad     eliot

  why anyone would order an sho with an automatic transmission is beyond me if you cant handle a stick you should stick with a regular taurus and leave the sho to real drivers that is not to say that there arent real drivers who cant use the stick eg disabled persons but they arent in any position to use an sho anyway   actually disabled persons have been known to drive in scca races  id be careful about making sweeping generalizations here  id prefer a manual transmission but the early sho had an awful transmission that felt like it came out of a truck or something it was almost enough to make me want an automatic  teddy  
  boylecactusorg craig boyle writes the quality of autobahns is something of a myth the road surface isnt much different to a typical tx freeway they are better in terms of lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc  they light the highways in texas  funny everywhere else ive been they only light em at junctions  sorry by they i meant autobahns not us freeways   i wont even get into how much road markings vary between states and localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are essentially nonexistant  than most of the roads here a dip in the asphalt that you test your shocks on at 00 will kill you at 000 dont get me wrong i love to  it would have to be quite severe i dont recall any us freeway without road damage warnings that i would regard as unsafe at 000 in any decent well damped car  i suspect you have very limited experience  us freeways vary dramatically particularly between states  i can name a number of interstate highways in various parts of the country where 000 would be very optimistic in any car  well ive driven in every state but alaska and drive about 00k per year i take long cross country trips any chance i get  its fun for me and i can get reimbursment my job allows me to drive rather than fly not to labor the point but ive driven just about every freewayin the us germany uk and france plus some in mexico which was surpisingly good   im not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations but i suspect every single bridge junction on i00 through ct would be considered so  theyre hard to take at 00mph  thats not the only interstate ive seen with such deviations but its one i drive frequently  yes but as a age of the total freeway in the us  all you have to do in this case is mark the hazard advising people to slow to 00 or so    texas is pretty much an edgecase  you cant assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such  texas freeways are varied sometimes a good surface mostly flat but i0 in ca is comparable and hilly  wideopen spaces  it just aint so  given the absence of other traffic and car built for 000 eg 000  most us freeways are just fine the problem is other road users and cops  jim frost jimfcenterlinecom  craig

i bought one for my wife    nnnnnnnng thank you for playing i cannot agree with this  i believed this and to put it nicely it was a piece of junk  i loved this car i babied it i pampered it and after 0 years it just couldnt stay together i would say that not everyone will have the problems that i had but know this its not just the car it is the ability to get the car fixed which will not happen at any chryslerdodgetake your pick dealer  i dont care if there are going to reform their dealersservice with the intro of the lh cars i will believe it when i see it  case and point the local dodge dealer  you drive up just looking you dont even get out of your door when about 00 yes 00 salesman all eye you like their next meal and literally pounce on you and try to get you to make a deal on everything your eye wanders towards service is about 0 times worse than that  i had an alignment problem but they tried to tell me that the k frame was bent and about 0000 dollars of workparts to fix it  let me tell you the problems i had and i took care of this car i put alot of miles on it in the first couple years but took it to every checkup it needed and many that shouldnt have been  0000 dodge shadow es  these were replaced within the 0 years that i owned the car  engine  0 alternators rear suspension torsion bar 0 water pumps 0 thermostats hall effect sensor main computer 0 batteries  these were rebuiltrepaired  radiator automatic transmission power steering   those are just the things i can remember off the top of my head  for about a year before i sold the car i said to myself its a good car i just cant find anybody competent enough the fix it  in the end before i traded it in for a saturn the power steering started acting up again  i just stopped putting money into it  i must have put at least 00000000 worth of repairs over its lifetime  i am sorry but lee iacocca can bite me  bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the hell do you think that lh has been nicknamed last hope  you can do better and i know people will disagree with me here but japanese like honda or toyota or the only american car company that i feel is a quality product saturn  i will not touch another chrysler product again no way  i dont care how good the lh cars look good and i will admit they look promising but not with the support that you get  gm isnt much better thank god they dont control saturn like they do their divisions or it would be just another marketing ploy    dont get me wrong i will be watching my car which i do like like a hawk for the next 0 years  i am much more hesitant to say it or any car is really good until it has proved itself to me  but since someone else pointed out cd as a source  i will note because i used to read these magazines that car and driver has never had a good thing to say about most chrysler products shadow for one always were they moaning about the reguritated kcar and engine  whereas motor trend always thought they were great cars  no car magazine is really objective  and although there are alot of people who dont like consumers reports i will use them to reinforce my argument i already know about the big stink with the saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are the shadowsundance rate much worse than average in fact none of the chryslers rate a better than average i think the best one is just average  excluding the diamond starmitsubishi stuff and the lhs  you can find bad stuff about the shadow  try as i might when i researched the saturn i could not find anything bad about it  there is a great deal of information about this company just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for good reason  much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company  i read an article which had a subcolumn an i think this imprinted on me more than anything else  some big wig in toyota said and i quote we are watching them very closely  come on everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to set in their ways which is one of the reasons saturn was created  they are still struggling because they havent learned yet  they have the ability the workers are not inferior the technology is not out of date but their attitude is and they are just finding this out  its called competition gentlemanwomen if you dont satisfy the demand of the consumer well your out    asbestos suit on  gaia

   just a quick simple question really  how many wheels are affected by the emergency brake on an 00 nissan maxima ive heard that all four are affected but this would seem unusual to me i thought the emergency brake on most cars only affected the rear wheels also how powerful is the emergency brake usually enough to lock wheels at 00mph hmmmm i just have to wonder about some of the things i hear  outatime    
   i was curious as to what people thought of the vw corrado vr0 thats about it  outatime    
  now now before we get too carried away here  keep in mind that owning any car in korea is a luxury that only the ruling class can afford  every government agency worth its salt finds some reason to levy a tax on car ownership last i heard there were seven different fees to pay to own a car  i believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic inefficiency that new president kim young sam wants to eradicate  basically i think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class  in exchange zaibatsus like hyundai screwed over smaller companies perpetuating a vicious cycle i have faith that korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone else but for now hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society of screwy components that wont work together  stubborn like a mule the car either wont go forward or wont stop at all  hahahahahaha  gasp  pant  hm im not sure whether the above was just a silly remark or a serious remark  but in case there are some misconceptions i think henry robertson hasnt updated his data file on korea sincemid 0000s  owning a car in korea is no longer a luxury  most middle class people in korea can afford a car and do have at least one car  the problem in korea especially in seoul is that there are just so many privatelyowned cars as well as taxis and buses the rushhour has become a 00 hour phenomenon and that there is no place to park  last time i heard back in january the kim administration wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide his or her own parking area just like they do in japan  also henry would be glad to know that hyundai isnt the only car manufacturer in korea  daewoo has always manufactured cars and i believe kia is back in business as well  imported cars such as mercury sable are becoming quite popular as well though they are still quite expensive  finally please ignore henrys posting about korean politics and bureaucracy  hes quite uninformed   t h brian chung           happiness is         this sig was brought jfealchemytncornelledu  tea earl grey hot  to you by frungy the jfecornellabitnet         000 lake st apt 00a  sport of kings cesr00thc                 ithaca ny 00000         
  anyone else experiencing a similar problem  this concerns the clutch on a 00 honda accord 0 speed when the clutch is first used in the morning about the first 0 miles of shifting there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up  then the clutch shifts smoothly  this chatter started when i moved to the san  francisco bay area from a lowhumidity environment  the dealer stated that this is known to happen since honda changed from an asbestos to nonasbestos clutch material  no remedy seems that moisture on clutch surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates  any comments out there

  i have a few questions about the tax on  a used car purchase i live in new york state and i am going to buy a used car i know that i will have to pay tax when i go to register the car but i would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car or on the purchase price  also what tax rate is used   the owner lives in albany 0 tax and i will be living in saratoga with 0 tax   do i pay albany tax or saratoga tax   the difference is a whole 00 one more thing how much does it cost for the usual 0 year registration   did i leave anything out  what else might i have to know to purchase and register a used car   ive never done this before  thank you peter volpe  
  hi there ive recently been toying with the idea of purchasing an old 000 the going rate seems to be about 0000 for cars with anywhere from 0000k mi my question is this what should i expect at this price should i expect to have extensive body work done what about engine  transmission should i likewise expect to have both virtually replaced along those lines does anyone have the names  addresses of any mailorder parts suppliers for everything from engine to body parts im completely new to the area of restoring cars and as i dont actually do any work with cars most of the work would have to be professionally done what sould i expect the cost of upgrading a 000 to a rustfree mechanically sound automobile thanks in advance andre     true 000 enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this but ill dump my impressions  ive wanted to own a 000 for about 00 years now came close once but i ended up buying a fiero instead biggest mistake of my life  anyway for 0000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit the most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the engine and passenger compartment  also look for chassis welded together here  oh yeah the price range you are talking about must be the 0 banger a 0 if you could find one would be mucho more bucks  parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by for an old car and you can even locate crude in the jc whitney catalog if you have too  the machine itself is pretty simple they use the spare tire for windshild washer instead of a pump fer chris sake so getting it fixed by a good bugporsche mechanic would be easy  since it is midengine you may spend more on labor for any mechanical work   jeff miller                 network systems corporation internetwork group          0000 boone avenue north jmillernetworkcom         minneapolis mn 00000   0000000000

  im considering switching to geico insurance but have heard that they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  i was worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  i have also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident   im interestend in determining whether or not these things are true has anyone out there with geico made a claim  id be interested in hearing whether or not you were satisfied with the service and whether you then had trouble renewing your policy   im also interested in any good or bad stories about liberty mutual or state farm   geico supports reads gives to police laser radars  they have been known  to be very picky  no sports cars no radar detectors although maryland  insurance board over rules this consistantly no turbos  basically it seems if you need to use your insurance ever they dont want  you  they once told me they wouldnt insure me perfect record because of  my corvette even though it would be insured by another specialty insurance   we must insure all the cars  i think this rep didnt know what she was  talking about  geico is cheap  but if you ever file a claim be prepared to be dropped  i  think in most areas two tickets will do it  geico will never see a dime from me if i can help it  state farm  slighty higher than most but very good response  not as picky  as geico

  im getting a car in the near future  ive narrow it down to 000zx and sc000 which might be a better choice  having driven both and having owned an sc000 for 00 months now all i can say is it depends  theyre both great cars  in fact my wife and i are saving our pennies so we can get her the 000zx convertible in a year the 000zx handles like a dream while the sc000 rides like a dream fit and finish on both are excellent but the lexus gets the nod in customer satisfaction  theyre both very attractive and hideously expensive  the resale value of the sc is better than the zx  the 000zx isnt available with traction control which makes it a handful on slippery surfaces   jim battan  sequent computer systems beaverton or battansequentcom or uunetsequentbattan 0 000 000 0000  
  if you want to annoy geico call them upgive fake namebut real car  specsget a quote and then tell them they are more expensive than your  current state farmallstate insurance  they will still send you quote etc then you can tear up their quote and stuff it in the prepaid return  envelope and mail it back to them  actually they were 00 more than my current state farm rates   actually ive had a bad habit of stuffing a whole bunch of other garbage junk mail in along with whatever else into anybodys prepaid envelopes until they almost burst  i believe they pay postage by weight heh heh heh  anyways dont tear up the quotes just yeti sometimes use their quotes or other insurance quotations as leverage to haggle for a lower rate elsewhere  usually it works to your advantage if  they are lower  aaron

  my son is considering the purchase of a 00 mgb which has been substantially restored  the odometer has rolled over but we cant be sure of the actual mileage  the engine and drive train apparently werent touched in the restoration except for a new carb and a few hoses  he plans to do vacuum and compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine  the body and undercarriage have no visible rust the interior is new as are tires front brakes not sure about the back battery bumpers and other misc parts the paint is checked in a few places and scuffed here and there allegedly by a windblown car cover  it seemed to handle ok except for soft front shocks questions  are there problem areas common to mgbs we should check out  the brakes seem soft and rather ineffective what should we expect in the way of braking action  it seemed to be doggy when accelerating from a stop  what should we expect it to do given the 0cylinder engine  the top is in place but will not reach a number of the snaps  the weather was cold  should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up or is it forever shrunk  is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted or are they usually chromed  given this rather limited description what would be a reasonable price  gee this turned out to be a little longsorry  while my brother once owned an xk000 jag what a car were obviously not into sports cars  any help with these questions or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be appreciated  phil truesdale truesdaldavidwheatonedu

   i would gladly spend twice the money for insurance rather than using geico  not only do they supply radar guns to the police they also want to make radar detectors illegal  they also ask if you have a detector probably to put you in a high risk group or just refuse to insure you  i know a few people who were droped by geico due to an accident that was not their fault  rob gallantoasysdtnavymil

  its been a while since ive reviewed a car but today i paid a visit to an old friend whose love for audis has been so overwhelming that he makes a not too sucessful living selling them  without further delay i will get to the 0000 audi s0   0 servotronic steering  for those who are not familiar with what servotronic is it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by zf and used in audis and bmws  i have been outspoken in my damming of servotronic over the past couple of months and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the audi 00 cs quattro and the audi 000cs fwd  i am quite happy to report now that on the s0 the servotronic is inoffensive  i suppose that due to the fat gumball tires the servotronic has been loaded up more and this so far has been the best implementation that i have tried  it is far from perfect mind you and id be much happier if it was an option that i could refuse but on the s0 i no longer consider this to be bad enough where i feel the entire car is ruined  the steering is still a tad too light but it is accurate and i suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the drivers hands  so there is feel and there is accuracy in the s0s steering  but there is also room for improvement  i consider the s0s steering to be better than the japanese competition primarily because the japanese do not believe in feel and engineer it out completely   0 engine  wheee what a pressure cooker  with just 000 miles on the clock i did not expect the s0 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out 00000 miles later but still the car packs a terrific punch  for a turbocharged machine it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving  ie low revs high gear  it is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that theres only 00 liters of displacement to move this 0000 pound car around in such a fashion  with maximum torque available at 0000 rpm and a 0000 rpm redline the car can pretty much be left in third all day which translates to a speed range of something like 00000 mph  a chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity v0s the technical achievement is breadthtaking  throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine in fact it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame downshifts are almost unnecessary  it is more fun to use the overboost feature than to rev the engine  for those not familiar the s0 engine features up to 00 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing  sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter one could with the right foot only in third gear blast the car from 00 to 00 in just a few moments simply by flooring the gas  as far as the numbers go maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 000 lb ft incredible for a 00 liter  it takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for  since this is quite a heavy car ones body parts are not flung around like say the corrado vr0  the acceleration is smooth and strong somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff  also one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding 0 banger  yes audi has refined the 0 to the point where at 0000 rpm it sounds as serene as it does at 0000  the smoothness is outstanding but not quite up to the standards of a very good 0 eg a 00 valve bmw  id say that in terms of refinement ie willingness to rev smoothness lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many v0s  however lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 0 cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful if not terribly refined the 00 valve turbo 0 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost  subjectively id rate the vw vr0 engine as being far more musical than the turbo 0 also audis own v0 is also far more musical with a rorty race car growl when pressed  though none of these can match its grunt  the only hint of the engines true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop  with the extra inertia from the permanently engaged 0wd system one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall  alternately one could use more revs in both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine  i think that audi of america should offer an automatic option for this car just as they offer though in extremely small numbers a 0 speed for the much peakier v0  the characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic  ironically in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush  marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again   0 chassis  ive noticed that audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths  the car comes with firestones of size 00000 zr00 which is not uncommon at all  however the very attractive 0 spoke wheels are no less than 0 inches wide so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever  combined with the flared wheel arches the s0 has a mouth watering macho yet subdued look   on rough concrete it becomes immediately clear that the new 000 body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression i suppose the two are interrelated but i digress  to use a cliche the s0s body feels like it has been carved out of stone  flex is totally undetectable even when going over rough roads  with a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the s0s ride quality will never worry a lexus it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars  the servotronic steering has already been mentioned  i consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering  i  was able to test the cars cornering powers without too much trepidation i think a new concept is at work in this car  with its fat gumball tires talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless  on a banked highway on ramp i went in slow and started applying power as i went around  i could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways  yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs it felt that the limits were not even close to being approached  the g forces were thrilling but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving  you tell the car what you want and it does it  end of story  i think that i am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the honda nsxs clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car  the brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too though ive read that they are prone to fade  i am not too surprised since the s0 does not have uprated brakes over the base audi 000 fwd harder pads would help but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold  i am starting to see a trend among the luxurysports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity  the ls000s fade performance is nothing to brag about neither is the q00s or the legends  brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybodys attention is focused on antilock capability   0 comfort  for a car with such sporty abilities its comfort levels are also excellent  the cabin is beautifully appointed with carbonfiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the 00 s0  all the expected gizmos are there heated seats power seats seat memory power this and that  the glaring ommision was the trip computer which was removed because audi hasnt gotten it to work reliably yet that means that the car has no boost gauge  a real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance    unusual for the germans the s0 comes with a honda style moonroof as well as the very intelligent dialasunroofposition rotary switch  noise levels including engine and tire noise is so low that i wouldnt consider the lexus advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer   0 conclusion  even though few will be able to afford an audi s0 at its sticker price of 00k the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition  the 00 valve turbo 0 is a real gem even if it doesnt produce ferrari sounds  no other luxurysports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some is worth the extra money all by itself  the safety features are also  top notch 0000 side impact standard compliant the very elegant  automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags  the 000 series audis have been outstanding in government crash tests  it gets my thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being all out exciting and intoxicating   eliot   
   hello   i am moving to houston to go to rice university for graduate school i will be living on the corner of s mian and university blvd  i was wondering what kind of liability rates to expect  here is the relevent info       sex male       age 00       status single       commute none walking       car 0000 ford crown victoria 0 door  if anyone can check the above info or is in a similar situation please email me the rates they find out or pay  thanks for your help in advance  colellodelphicom colellocheshireoxyedu   my suggestion look at your current insurance card there will be a name  accross the top telling you which insurance company you are insured by call information in houston and get the number of a branch office in the  houston area call the insurance company  your rates will vary depending on the amount of coverage you want do you want to carry comp and collision probably not on an 00 what your driving record is  you mentioned none of these things in your posting so how can anyone give you accurate information  like i said pick up the phone and make a few calls it wont kill you   jeff     
  derek  there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights will come back on after 00 weeks the tool is in fact illegal in europe  atleast it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a  used bmw and a few weeks later all the lights come on other than that i know  of no other tool anyone else   about changing oil every 00000 miles thats ok on newer audis they  only require it after every 00000 miles i am talking about an oil change just a query do you drive your car very very carefully like no sudden  acceleration etc if yeah then the 00000 m oil change seems quite reasonable but if you drive kinda fast id get a bit up tight abot that 00000 thingy  a point to note just because the first light came on at 0k doesnt mean all the others will come on every 0k too  shaz

  in my opinion the limited tort option is the best thing casey has ever done basically limited tort means that you give up your right to sue for pain and suffering unless one of the following conditions is met 0 your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed x where x is some number like 00000  im not sure of the exact number  0 the accident was caused by a drunk driver i mean the other driver was drunk  0 you get a good lawyer and have a good case basically you can appeal to regain your right to sue but theres almost no chance of this ever happening  you are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering you can still sue for medical costs actual damages etc by agreeing to limited tort you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery in exchange you get a substantial reduction in your rates i save 000year  unfortunately the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse people so much that only about 0 of pennsylvanians go for limited tort i guess thats ok  if more people opted for it the insurance companies would be pushing harder for repeal

   i was curious as to what people thought of the vw corrado vr0 thats about it  outatime  it hauls butt handles nice but is junk  i drove a brand new one for a day as a loaner  the key was already rustingseems they stamp their keys out of potmetal  all the controls seemed really junkclutch was heavy door locks power buttons sunroof controls etc  seemed really cheap no way i would pay 00k for this baby  no airbag either  i also drove a svx for a daystickered at 00k but going out the door for 00ka much better buy imo  although it is more of a sports touring couperoomy etc the corrado is more of a small sports car  the ergonomics and leather in the svx was twice as nice as the corrados  both had smooth strong engines

  from article 0000apr0000000000000sequentcom by troysequentcom troy wecker    earlier i commented on the valentine0 and jimfcenterlinecom replied  about the value of the units bogey counter  i didnt really go into  why i called this feature a gimmick so here is more explanation  thanks  jim for the good comments and opinion            from what i understand the valentine0 can only tell if these  microwaves are coming from the front rear or both  there are only  two antennas  if they are coming from both this in interpreted as a  side bogey  bogey counts are determined as sources by their  relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the  same source           it sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not actually using the valentine0  id like to give some feedback based on real life experince  i keep the valentine0 in advanced logic mode and it rarely lights up as a christmas tree  the only time it does is when i am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes sense that is does since there are  0 sources coming from many different directions  i have found the valentine0 to be consistent in its reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area  i have found the directional indication to be very useful  in one case there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other  as i passed the first radar trap the direction indication changed  then the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction  with other radar detectors i would have assumed that this was due to a reflection but with the valentine0 i knew there was a high probability that there was another trap  and there was  on other occasions the directional helped discern a false alarm from a true alarm  for example as i pass a source the direction indicator changes  the directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the  place  when a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector that leaks i can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the car passes me i can verify the source  with other detectors i would have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar trap when there was none  ive had the valentine0 for several months now and find its added features to be useful and not gimmicks                                         barry                                                                       barry frishberg                                             blfapollochhpcom chelmsforduk expert center                                      000tn 0000000 chelmsford ma

  hi i need your help with a problem i have with a 0000 mitsubishi galant gs transmission  the car has a 0 speed manual tranmission since the car was bought new while shifting from 0nd to 0rd  unless  i do it slowly and carefully it makes a popping or hitting sound the dealer and mitsubishi customer service reached by an 000  say  this is normal for the car  is it and about a year ago at 00kmiles the stick shift handle got stuck while attempting to put it in reverse    0 the shifter would not budge  the clutch had no effect    0 the front tires would not budge even when the clutch is       fully depressed    0 if the clutch is released the engine would die    0 assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was       stuck i could not make the car move  it acted as if       it were in neutralexcept for dying when clutch is released    0 i finally was able to release the shifter by having        someone rock the car back and forth less than an inch       while i depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter    0 the shifter acted normally after that  when this happened i took it to the dealer they checked the  clutch it was ok they checked the transmission it was ok  i had the exact problem a couple of months ago and again last week  the dealer says there is nothing they can do because  mitsubishi the 000  says they have never heard of the problem and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car   in all three occurances the car was parked head first in a garage and since the front wheels were stuck the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter hence temporarily solving the problem  and the dealer and mitsubishi refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck  i know there is smething wrong with the transmission shifting  from 0nd to 0rd and getting stuck at random but i cant get  the dealer to fix it i need your help with the mechanical problems  and with how to handle mitsubishi   all hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated and sorry to bore you with the long post  thanks rabih

  talking about car alarms there are certain cars in this country that are  only insurable if they are fitted with a vecta alarm were talking coswoths and porsches and stuff just before they the insurance companies decided to  make this move they insisted that the car be fitted with a scorpion alarm  now theyve changed to the vecta so everyone whos spent  on fitting  the scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the vecta system  sad huh shaz  
  i dont know about saabs but whenever there is a long temr tset in a magazine they always say that tehyre are little annoying niggles which keep on occuring every so often i wouldnt expect that from such a quality car why  doesnt anything like this ever happen on bmws maybe coz theyre quality cars    shrugs repentently   shaz

  i got a price quote of 0000000 for a camry v0 wabs from a toyota dealer in  eatontown i came back to that dealer in two weeks to sign a purchase agreement then i was told that the salesperson made an error in pricing i walked out of  that dealer i wonder if this kind of practice is common with toyota dealers  is the price quote written on the salespersons business card binding i would appricate any comments   i had a similar experience  we had a written quote which had been mailed to us from the salesman at one of these nohaggle toyota dealers for a camry xle wabs leather etc  the price seemed fair but when we went in to take them up on their offer they discovered that certain extra cost items hadnt been included in their original written quote it would have totaled an extra 0000 and in spite of the fact that we had a written quote they said there was nothing they could do  bottom line quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that the toyota dealers think theyve got such a superior auto that they dont have to deal  we walked went out and bought a new lh car eagle vision tsi and i dont regret it one bit   thad mcculloch mccullocmailldsloralcom

  mail bounced so  i am in the process of buying a new auto  i havent decided yet whether i should sell my current car myself or trade it in as part of the new auto purchase  traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it  yourself if you dont mind that extra hassle  having a tradein on a purchase just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing  i know that the blue book value for the car is 0000  i assume this is retail bluebook  there are two bluebook prices one for retail and one for wholesale  you really want the retail price if you can  get it  the blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage and extras on your particular car  you should look all this stuff up yourself also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country that may not apply in your area  for example blue book prices are low for california  a better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is to call around and see what its selling for if any used lots have one or looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices  it  might be more time efficient to take a small loss rather than hold out for 0 months for the best price  an acquaintence has offered to give me blue book value for the car  i dont know what you mean by an acquaintance but i would make darn sure that i was paid that is cashiers check in full before delivery  theres a real temptation when selling to a pseudofriend to be more accomodating than you should  make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying in full at the start with a cashiers check or cash then i would go elsewhere  rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook  thats probably a safer approach than selling to a private party      alan                         mountain dew and doughnuts    ameselroyalan           because breakfast is the most important meal    alanelroyjplnasagov      of the day

  paul hovnanian wrote    based on my experience with a 00 fj00  the hardtop jeepstyle model  i   would definitely give a new model consideration if i were in the market the  older models are very well built unless toyota lost its mind i would  assume until  proven otherwise that the newer models have inherited some  if not all of the qualities of their ancestors    two major differences in the running gear that im aware of need study  my 00 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have  independant front suspension the solid axle is theoretically stronger and   the new cruisers do not have independent suspension in the front  they still run a straight axle but with coils  the 0runner is the one with independent front  the cruisers have incredible wheel travel with this system    more reliable than the newer model but only experience will tell the  independant front suspension is no doubt a compromise made to satisfy  the typical user who will never need a real utility vehicle the second  difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models im  not sure but i think tioyota went to a fulltime 0wd or allwheel drive  system the older landcruisers have a lockup type both have their  advantages and disadvantages   the 00up cruiser does have full time 0wd but the center diff locks in low range  my brother has a 00 and is an incredibly sturdy vehicle which has done all the 0 trails in moab without a tow  the 00 and later is even better with the bigger engine and locking diffs   jim chott                            00 toyota 0wd pickup rzaa00emailspsmotcom             00 lemans sport convertible tempe arizona

   in a previous article gwmspl0splloralcom gary w mahan says  could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients ie cd mentioned in magazines  i understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but what does this mean in the real world  is there a way to calculate new top speedsassuming the car is not rev limited at top speed or mileage benefits if a identical car had the cd reduced from 00 to 00  its pretty complex and cd isnt the whole story either  cd for cars is usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car  so a large car with a good cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a poorer cd   to calculate drag use this formula  d  00  rho  v0  cd  s  where d is the drag force lbs rho is the local air density slugsft0 v is the velocity fts and s is the frontal area ft0  note that the pieces called 00  rho  v0 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure a fancy aero term for air pressure or force   note that power is  p  f  v  where p is power lbffts f is the force drag in this case lbf and v is velocity fts   note that if you put the whole equation into one by substituting d for force you get a velocity cubed term  thats why huge increases in power result in little increases in speed  ditto for decreases in cd   so if you have a 000 mph car and reduce cd from 00 to 00 your new top speed is  sound of trumpet fanfare  000 mph  sorry to dissappoint     al bowers  dod 000  alfa  ducati  hobie  kottke  blad  iaido  nasa well goodness sakesdont you know that girls cant play guitar                                              mary chapincarpenter

    derek    there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights  will come back on after 00 weeks the tool is in fact illegal in europe   atleast it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a   used bmw and a few weeks later all the lights come on other than that i know   of no other tool anyone else     about changing oil every 00000 miles thats ok on newer audis they   only require it after every 00000 miles i am talking about an oil change  just a query do you drive your car very very carefully like no sudden   acceleration etc if yeah then the 00000 m oil change seems quite reasonable  but if you drive kinda fast id get a bit up tight abot that 00000 thingy    a point to note just because the first light came on at 0k doesnt mean  all the others will come on every 0k too    shaz shaz  hmm but the service indicators that i have works this way   there are 0 green0 yellow 0 red indicators   initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start   your car the computer will actually sense how you drive your car and   as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and   then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go   on and you should get service when by the time green indicators are off      after service the mechanicor you will reset the service indicators and the   computer starts counting again  so i expect to have a toolor a procedure to reset it so the green lights will  come on and the yellow and red lights will go off  i wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the indicator  its the first european car i have and changing oil at 00000 miles is a  surprise to me and its a big plus  but i wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time i thought its the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil  any bmw owner on the net response welcomed  ps  my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a bmw  derek

  i prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be  i believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive  automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy more time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrating on the road  the manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something granted it isnt a large movement  plus driving should be fun  driving a manual is fun driving an automatic is a chore in the case of shift speed automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick  if i was racing id want and automatic  for normal driving go with the manual  
   here is a press release from the national crime prevention council    the campaign urges drivers to remember to lock up roll up and look around     lock car doors immediately after entering or leaving the car     roll up windows as far as possible and     look around and be alert to avoid situations that are        suspicious         that reminds me of a blurb in the police blotter in my school paper along the lines of police were called because so and so reported there were suspicious people hangning around the business building  turns out it was two black men leaving the building after doing homework late one night

   you know im a ford fan i must say so im looking forward to the next  mustang  i have faith that it will be a fine product more desireable  than the camaro is now  you know thats mho      truethats your opinion    they beat ford to the market with the camarofirebird but really only  in words  production of these vehicles will be limited until the  end of the year keeping selling prices above msrp for the most part  since there are so many twitching camaro fans out there  i wouldnt  press ford to hurry the mustang since the final wait could be worth it  besides no bowtie fanatic is gonna buy the mustang anyway    true again i wouldnt take a free mustanghonest    the next mustang will be fords highest profile car  it attracts  way more attention than the camarofirebird because its heritage  is more embedded in the general public  dont lie to yourself and  believe ford will forfeit that    fyi they already did  too bad that the current mustang cant even compete with the new  camaro without using an active imagination  right now few cars can compare with the 00 camaro think about it  00000 for a car that will out perform all but a few exotics  if you are now swearing at me look at the statsthey dont lie   there are no comparable cars in its class certinaly not for its price      you knowintelligent critical spews like the mustang bites man    some of you are already beginning  i predict that the mustang and camaro  will be comparable performers as usual    i also agree this subject is one that will never be setteled  except maybe at the  track     unless the ford gets the 00v 000hp romeo  you dont seriously believe  that it was designed for the mark viii only do you    hey can you imagine the potential of a modified lt0  folks in a few years we will surpass the levels of performance   achieved in the late 00s thats scary  you ford vs chevy people must live in the planet of detroit or droid  like they say in the airforce with enough horsepower anything will fly  i can put a 00valve v0 with twin garret0s on yugo and get 00sec qm thats useless  its still a yugo that will loose any race on a track or on the street  have you detroit beings compared the ultralongthrow stick shifts of the 00 with the 00 mr0 turbo or 00 rx0 i ll buy it in 0 mos   or the torsen differential of the rx0 compared to the differential of  the 00 that sounds in every hairpin turn   and bythe way 00 and camaro both have drums on the rear breaks  hello  this is the 00 s   vlasis theodore software engineer  just say no to signatures

  natarajartsgmotcom  writes  i heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than  gas engines because the emit less of carbon monoxide  hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen  co hc nox    but they can put out a lot of particulate matter  i heard  something about legislation being discussed to clean up  diesel emissions  is there anything in the works to  install scrubbers for diesels  how about the feasibility  of installing them on trucks and cars  would it be any  different than a catylitic converter  id assume easier  since were removing particulate matter instead of converting  gasses  lets hear peoples opinions     vw and mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps  also vw uses a kind of turbocharger on their jetta ecodiesel that helps reduce particulates as well although i dont know the mechanics of it   many diesel carsbusses and trucks in europe are now being equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up diesel emissions already well below legal limits anyway   its a shame gm had to soil the diesels reputation in passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even further ahead of gas engines in emissions   erik     i sure dont know what and how they measure in regards to diesel   motors in cars trucks and busses but i think they are probably  measuring the wrong pollutants or at the wrong time or both     i certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or  diesel truck and some diesel cars  they stink  and its always  rollupthewindows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front  of me when i am driving with my family     i dont think the combustion mixture is kept under very good  control in diesel engines and thats why they stink  so the   invisible unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels  yeah  well so what  someone forgot about the visible stinky kind and  as far as i am concerned those kind are just as bad      i am all for destinking the diesel vehicles  itll keep the  traffic signs cleaner too   fred w bach     operations group          internet musicerichtriumfca  triumf triuniversity meson facility      voice  0000000000 loc 000000  0000 wesbrook mall ubc campus              fax    0000000000  university of british columbia vancouver bc canada   v0t 0a0   these are my opinions which should only make you read think and question  they do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer or fellow workers

   hello auto enthusiasts    i recently had more car mangled broken into and decided to  get an alarm installed  its a viper 000 and has a shock  sensor sensors for each door ignition cutoff and automatic  door locks  i have this same alarm installed in my syclone  it works great  the shock sensor is very sensitive but much more practical than the motion sensor i have on my other car  it doesnt trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind but any kind of shock sets it off  even kicking the tire sets it off  it works great     what worries me is the hood and hatch  if someone could pry   them up gently enough then they could bypass the alarm  the shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it  you can adjust it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without setting off the alarm  although i know that you cannot pop the hood on the syclone without setting off my alarm now and yet i have had zero none false alarms with this system  the alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has been activated in your absence  i have been able to trace every alarm to its cause and it was not a false alarm    im also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl  underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm   i guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle  my syclone is so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this  there are supplemental power supplies you can put on with this viper alarm but i dont have one  i really think that if someone wants my car that bad the alarm wont keep them from it even with a supplemental power supply   viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that  supposedly detects people approcahing the car   this is primarily for convertibles  i have a convertible and have looked at this feature in detail  alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want to get one of these  it has zones in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm it shuts down the zone or rather pulls it in tighter i dont see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you leave the top down on  avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package  it talks to people as they walk by  i saw one installed on a lotus esprit  the kids would taunt it seeing how close they could get before it warned them to get back  the owner finally disabled it which defeats the purpose in my mind    im interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems  and about the viper in general   i am real happy with my viper  one other feature i really like is you can tune it to your preferences  you can have it arm passively or not  you can disable the chirp for armingdisarming  you can have it lockunlock the doors when the alarm is armeddisarmed    i like these features  i hate the chirp when the alarm armsdisarms so mine flashes the lights only  i like the door lock feature although i have to be careful to take my keys with me because it doesnt know if you have left your keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors  but if you are meticulous about taking your keys with you it takes care of the rest  the car is an 00 ford probe gt that used to be in great shape      ron garnett    i looked seriously at the alpine system too  it is a real nice system but more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor  the shock sensor is betterand the viper shock sensor is better 0 cycle than the optional alpine one imho  i think the viper gives you a lot of good value for the money  but it isnt absolutely tamperproof  no system is  except maybe the one that james bond had on his lotus in for your eyes only  anyone know where we can get one of those installed  maybe that was what they had in the van in the world trade center huh   merrill   
   i tried the autofom stuff on my 0000 saturn sc and was so disappointed with it that i returned it for a refund  i polished the car for 0 hours and couldnt remove the swirl marksthin film that was all over the finish  it also attracted more dirt than without the stuff  
   before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm lets go on the assumption that one is desired  the question then remains which one  ive owned a hornet and was satisfied but not enough to get another for my new car  the alpine has been highly recommended but what about clifford and vses derringer 0  any others  i want all of the standard stuff door lock interface starter kill light flash led valet mode passiveactive shockmotion sensor etc  thanks for the advice   
  keep in mind that owning any car in korea is a luxury that only the ruling class can afford  every government agency worth its salt finds some reason to levy a tax on car ownership last i heard there were seven different fees to pay to own a car    we used to have a tax in greece named after the queens mother the queen left monarchy was abolished but the tax stuck  similar single purpose taxes have stuck ie to help the victims of  the earthquake of 00xx build the metro  obmoralconclusion next time someone proposes a car tax or gasoline tax promising its temporary it aint   spiros   spiros triantafyllopoulos                    c00stkocrsv00delcoelectcom software technology delco electronics       000 0000000 gm hughes electronics kokomo in 00000      i post therefore i armm

  as a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the us while  here in europe they are rare just wondering  primarily milage  gas is much more expensive so people are very concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer  this along with narrow old cities also results in smaller cars with smaller engines  these engines usually dont have the torque to mesh well with an automatic  so having engines that dont work well with autos and a great concern for milage the usual eurocar has a manual  note that not many big benzes come with manuals  if youve got the money for the car youve got the money for the gas and the engine to drive through the slushbox  as automatics become more efficient the bigotry is probably reduced  still everyone knows how to drive a manual and cars are cheaper with one and it saves a little expensive fuel  so there arent compelling reasons to go automatic  db

   v00 anyone anyone heard of a cizata v00t  its mainly sold in the middle  east where they dont have as strict a legislation as in the usa and ec  
  thanx craig in addition to craigs coments  and to clear up any  further confusion the 000sx of usa was reffered to as a silvia turbo in the uk performance figures of uk 000sx are  000 00s vmax 000mph shaz  oh one more q you know that new prelude vtec well is there an auto version in the usa ive heard of them in japan but not uk also do you guys get  auto miatas  
  since were on the subject of brakes does anyone know why a 0wd vauxhall opel disengages drive to the rear wheels when the brakes are applied vauxhall boast about how the car is more stable in fwd mode during braking than in 0wd mode how is this so  shaz  
   yeah diesels are cleaner than petrol powered cars they even have catalysts  fitted to disels now oh and citroen have even launched the first sports  diesel car in the world which is probably true if you assume if its for  production purposes mercbenz had a prototype which runs on diesel back in  around 0000 it did  and read this  000 mph shaz  
  in the ec the corrado vr0 is rated as best handling car this side of a  000 as it goes i just read an article in autocar  motor comparing the  vr0 to a ford probe later to be launched in the uk the vr0 is more powerful even more so coz its 00 instead of 00 in the ec and more fun to drive etc etc but the probe has a slightly smoother engine thanx mazda mx0  they sum it up as both cars are fast  the vr0 is a bit more exhilirating to  drive but only if youre prepared to work harder  shaz

  hi would someone like to post a comparative analysis quantitative measures hp etc and more so the qualitative feel of how they compare for the driving feel handling noise responsiveness etc for the saab 0000000s and the bmw 00 series any comments on just comparing the 000 with the 0000 re handling  i take it that the saabs and bmws are comparable for reliability and all thatwould be nice if flaming wars could be avoided and folks just post their experiences   i had a 00 saab 000 turbo and now have a 00 bmw 000is  there is no comparison for handling reliability or overall quality of engineering the bmw wins hands down after 0 years i was sick and tired of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the saab the 0year old bmw is still as sweet as it was new  but i see you are posting from western ma bmws suck in the snow i have aggressive snows plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back and i still try to avoid driving in the snow i happily took the saab through blizzard conditions without a worry i would say this is the single design flaw in the bmw     jonathan edwardsedwardsintranetcom intranet inc0000000000

   still its amazing in germany you can have cars traveling 000 mph and 00 mph  on the same 0 to 0 lane road  around washington dc they cant keep traffic  flowing at 00  actually thatd be 000 mph and 00 mph the legal speed limit for trucks  in two lanes each direction its a hell of a rush when those trucks fly  by or was that me flying by them who cares the rush is really something  else and so is the draft  ron

  none of the configurations are perfectly inherently balanced which is what i was talking about  balance shafts and mass on either ends of the cranks can eliminate these forcesmoments which is something i also pointed out  and didnt you also say that it was easier to add masses than to add balance shafts  the sad truth is that some makers dont bother to put balance shafts on their big shaky 0s  the three cranks i refer to            i                                                        i                   0 0      i0                                            evenfiring 000 deg    0          0           k          0     0              j          fp0                                       mp0                                         0 0      fs0rlzcos0t                                                  ms0                                          j                                                        j                   0 0      flat0                                          evenfiring 000 deg  k   0          0                         0     0                    i    fp0                                       mp0                                         0 0      fs0           a  crank spacing                      ms0arlzcos0t                   j                                        j                0   0                                                           0 0      flat0                                             evenfiring 000 deg        k                                                                    i    fp0                                            mp0azcost                                         0 0      fs0                0   0                             ms0   how about     0 0                                                        0     0  if this is ridiculous kindly explain why its been more than 00 years since i studied this stuff    flat 0s and i0s both have the potential to be nearly vibration free  because subaru does that has nothing to do with i0s in general or porsche  i think subaru somehow connecting themselves to porsche is an absurdity and im not a porsche fan  big wing dings  these configurations overhead cams etc etc etc have been around for nearly 000 years   the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles for the orthodox inline 0 they are using a horizontally opposed 0 which is unique in that market segment  and porsche also uses a flat six in their 000 so whats the problem  i dont see any claim that their engine is as good as a porsches they are simply pointing out that they use the same configuration as a porsche if you want to nitpick ad campaigns i think there are far more blatant excesses than this   eliot

  wratunisqluucp wharfie writes my car was recently destroyed in a hail storm   i fully expected to get jerked around by the insurance company i wasnt the only one who had hail damage  state farm opened its claim centers on evenings and weekends and flew down additional adjusters from dallas  i have no experience with state farm but i think its important to differentiate your experience from a typical accident  hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner and also tends to be well publicized in the media so its to the ins cos benefit to respond promptly and helpfully  damage like this doesnt imply anything about the likelihood of future claims unless you live in an area that gets frequent damaging hail storms so theres no reason for them to stop covering you thats a lot different from atfault accidents or theftrelated claims which may be more indicative of claim patterns

  i just have got to remind all of you that this is it  yes thats right somtime this fall ford the granddaddy of cars will be introducing an allnew megacool waytoofastforaccorddrivers mustang  its supposed to be 000 streamlined looking similar to the mach iii concept car ford came out with around january  i cant wait  anyone out there hear anything about it recently   if everything ive read is correct ford is doing nothing but re skinning the existing mustang with minor suspension modifications and the pictures ive seen indicate they didnt do a very good job of it    the new mustang is nothing but a recycle of a 00 year old car  jeff

   does anybody have any information on the second generation broncos im not talking about bronco iis im referring to the broncos that began production in 0000 based on the f000 chassis i believe  ahh broncos  well personally i have a 00  the blue book is just a hair over 0 grand  i bought it for 0000 and then bought new tires 000 front end rebuild 000 carb rebuild 000  then i did the unthinkable and blew the engine not bronco specific unmaintained engine with 000000 0000 more bucks there now it is in nice condition well after new seats out of a tbird radio 0 amps speakers alarm well the radio and amps were  free and i bought the speakers used for 00 bucks and the other speakers i took out of my old jeep sell a jeep for a bronco you might ask but it was a wagoneer  its a lovely specimen solid front and rear axels ford 0 and a dana 00 up front  watch the rear axel wrap i  busted off my ubolts once i added traction shocks after that and  havent had a problem since  also the bottom of the doors tend to  rot bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones that might be in your budget  the post 00 broncos have that sickly ttb front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were as the 0000 have nice big cast iron longer radius armsie more prspective wheel travel  the only rust i have is on my doors and a few dings in the sheet metal  i dont know when the removeable tops were discontinued but they are fun  i just ordered a full convertable top for 000 for minecredit card  dont ever break the window if you have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over 000 bucks to replace  my bronco also does pretty good offroad i havent bottomed out my suspension yet and have crossed over 0 foot deep of water with no problems handles rocks like a charm too one problem is it is wide and you sometimes cant follow a cj or a toyota between two rocks or trees and your grandmother will have a hard time getting up into it  bob  
    he was as smooth as silk it was the most amazing shifting demonstration ive ever seen having said all that i  still dont know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without a clutch why do it  ego trip    mark walker my old man always said mwalkerchamaeeceunmedutoo much is just right 0000000000  home 0000000 guess that applies to my preferences albuquerque nm in performance cars  
  i have they showed the foot cam and telemetry for rusty wallace shifting at at lanta last year and he never touched the clutch except very slightly when down shifting  000 hp is pretty powerful to me  i doubt his trans uses standard syncros  there are several mechanisms for coupling a gear with the transmission output shaft some of which are fine for racing and unsuitable for street use    mark walker my old man always said mwalkerchamaeeceunmedutoo much is just right 0000000000  home 0000000 guess that applies to my preferences albuquerque nm in performance cars  
  btw i just saw the new q00 on tv this weekend  the big changes a grille has been added looks nice too and some wood for the interior  otherwise it looked largely unchanged   they changed the lights and slope of the hood along with the new grille  otherwise it is unchanged  interestingly their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a big design statement they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve their own niche  unfortunately sales were only half those of the lexus and hence they now join the pack  i still wonder if much of the problem wasnt the slow start from the initial ad campaign  personally i like the q without the grille   steve morris ma     internet smorrissumaxseattleuedu addiction studies pgm  uucp    uwbeaveruunetgtenmcdataiosumaxsmorris seattle university     phone    000 0000000 dept or 0000000 direct seattle wa 00000

   i dont think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem  unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight  fluid  follow the manufacturers recommended oil weight  some of the  cars i have had all standard transmissions 0 or 0 speeds recommend  changing the transmission fluid at 00000 miles under normal driving  conditions  ive gone 000000 without changing the transmission oil and  had to replace the transmission bearings my older cars used 00 weight  oil whereas my 00 honda uses 0000 motor oil or maybe 00 weight  
  i agree with jeffs reply  ive never changed the brake fluid except when having a brake job which is usually at around 00000 miles alot of freeway driving  however i will start to do this as preventative maintenance on my new car  also there are brake system flushing agents that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the system it can cause problems so its been recommended not to use them unless you are 000 certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent  just for your info i was quoted a price of labor0000 and fluid000 for flushing the brake system this in conjunction with a break job so i dont know if it was more without the brake job this is in the sf bay area  
  hi javier how are things at corp my old stomping ground was clevel vibration when applying the brakes can be caused on disc brakes at least by warped rotors when the brakes are applied there results uneven pressure on the rotor  turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning ie within spec there could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free  
  the villagerquest seem like the best of the cravanvoyager copies to come along since the mazda mpv  the nissan maxima engine paired with the maxima 0 speed auto trans should be an excellent drive train and the rest of the vehicle seems well engineered  only the price is controversial  hmm  the last time i checked villagerquest does not have a maxima engine and is very much under powered for its weight

   before you go in find out the invoice prices of the car add a reasonable   profit for the dealer 000000 offer them that price and stick to   it  whoa  watch your terminology  dealer invoice is not dealer cost youll hear lots of ads screaming two dollars over dealer invoice sounds like a real deal huh  no  you know what the dealer invoice also called factory invoice is  its a piece of paper with numbers on it that the factory sends the dealer  what do the numbers signify  absolutely nothing  its a marketing gimmick that the salesman can wave in your face to impress you  note that nowhere on the invoice does it claim to be the real price of the car and most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast low voice saying something like invoice may not reflect actual dealer cost  actually i guarantee it does not reflect actual dealer cost  also the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that you want  haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of dealer prep and protection package ie a few squirts of paint and fabric protectant  while youre at it ask the salesman to toss in a thing or two that doesnt cost him any cash  my  wife and i got a joyride in a twinturbo mitsubishi 0000gt when we bought our mitsubishi minivan

   let me explain why i feel the bogey counter feature is a gimmick radar waves bounce off objects especially metal  that is how radar speed measurement works  a high frequency microwave x band approx 00 ghz and k is approx 00 ghz is sent out and reflected back to the antenna off of an automobile or other objects  if an object is moving a doppler shift about 00 hz per mph on x band occurs is measured and converted to miles per hour  these waves bounce all over the place and they can reflect many times and go in many directions  from what i understand the valentine0 can only tell if these microwaves are coming from the front rear or both  there are only two antennas  if they are coming from both this in interpreted as a side bogey  bogey counts are determined as sources by their relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the same source  im certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis on which to make this argument but dont you answer your own question  is the reflected signal shifted at all from the act of being reflected  if so wouldnt it then be easy for the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct sources  here is the problem  since the microwaves reflect how does the unit tell if it is a source or a reflection  take a valentine0 and drive to the local grocery store that uses an xband radar door opener  you can tell by the small black box above the door pointed down at about a 00 degree angle and your detector going off when it gets near  the valentine0 will count 0 or 0 bogeys from all directions front rear and sides it doesnt say which side  the count changes as cars drive by and reflections change  is there 0 or 0 sources  not at the store i go to  as i drive around with a standard detector i can only find one source and that is the door opener for the front door  troy wecker troysequentcom sequent computer systems beaverton or   david w hwang md                      davidganglionannarbormius

   writes i looked at that bimmer yesterday its an 00 has about 00kmi according to owner odometer stopped working at 00kmi drivess well sounds good body is ok he wants 0000 i liked the car despite its auto tranny but my wife will be a primary driver on this one and she wants auto the radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn  the ac seems to have a leak the sunroof is sticky but operational odometer does not work as mentioned before idle is a bit bouncy going from 000rpm to 0000rpm wipers are slow thats teh gripes the owner says that he changed radiator alternator rotors and calipers exhaust the biggest problem is that the owner is a shifty sob telling strange stories i hate that i would never buy from a persom like that except how often you see a descent 000i for that amount of money he also said that although i could bring a mechanicin he wouldnt let me check the car by taking  it to a garage suspicious and who knows what milage is on it so let me know what to check for given theres practically no rust i know there was an article on 000i in rd a few years back anybody remembers what issue mikes  dont buy it  all of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches later on  also it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably know bmws are not cheap to fix either  the owner sounds like a shady character just trying to take advantage of someone sure  0000 sounds good but you should calculate how much the repairs will be it sounds like you would have to sink in at least  0000 to get everything fixed if not more also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned who knows how many miles are on it and how it was driven  sure people tell you bmws hold up but you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear for all you know it could have 000000 miles on it  the thing you have to remember is that this isnt the last 000i around either just wait and keep shopping for around  00000000 you can probably find one that is better needs less repair and has legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering take it from a guy who has been taken a couple of times good luck al himsl

  the part about spending 00000000 on repairs reminds me of an article i read in a magazine comparing the 0 year ownership costs of a toyota camry and a ford taurus or something like that  the result which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period  that was their argument to prove that you dont go wrong buying the ford taurus over the camry  now if i remember correctly the camry costs about 0000 or so more in initial costs  essentially it means that you spend about 0000 extra on repairs on the taurus  that is ridiculous  every time your car needs repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other things i would much rather spend 0000 more in initial costs than spend 0000 more in repair costs  did you account for depreciation  i seriously doubt that a taurus would rack up an extra 0000 in repair costs over 0 years  teddy

  i still cant understand all the hype about the impalla ss it still has the ugly caprice body orca on wheels  the caprice was the worst new body style to come out of detroit ever now just because the lt0 engine and a few suspension tweeks are being added  its still ugly its still a barge  gms answer to everything is throw in a v0 and someone will buy it  or add some plastic ground affects and a few stickers and call it a gt gtz or ss and someone will buy it  imho gm needs to scrap the caprice body completely and start over with a blank sheet of paper  no minor modification wheel well treatments tail amp modification or nose redesign or even the lt0 engine will help the existing caprice  jeff  
   re extended ka bands  i recently bought a 0 band detector  you guys must all think im nuts right  well i did a little research into ka usage in this area and found out that ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states  heres how i found out   a cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesnt even know    what ka is  hes heard of k which is what they use here and i   explained that ka is used for photo radar etc he then said yeah   ka stands for k automatic duuhh  he then went on to say that   plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high   tech were concerned but he didnt know too much   my 0 year old 0 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps   even the real sneaky ones   when i called the escort shop they confirmed that ka is not used here   or in surrounding states  they did claim that laser was being used   a lot here which i was quite skeptical of  so in the end instead of spending a lot of money andor waiting months for a state of the art detector i got a low priced high performance 0 band escort 0000  incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in x and k band detection  i know that escort has been surpassed by other brands lately but ive never fully relied on a detector and i was convinced that the escorts would be at least quite good which was good enough for me and my wallet   eliot

  we have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration let me ask  a similar question from the aviation field you must have seen images of prop  planes with all cylinders exposed i have seen up to 0 cylinders positioned  radially in a circular fashion with the prop at the center of the circle  this arrangement always brings up a geometric dilemma how can one crankshaft  throw accomodate 0 rods or are the pistons displaced but not visible from the  outside  bijan  
     one more way which works in manual trans cars ive driven and it is my personal favorite the other suggestions above are great but try this one too     while pushing the shifter gently towards reverse let the clutch out slowly right to the friction point and the shifter will be pulled into position if you do it right the car wont jump backward nor will the gears grind you will just glide back   sam  i can vouch for this method in my 0000 sho  this is the only sure way of  putting in the reverse without any problem every time  vikas sontakkedigital equipment corporation maynard ma internetsontakkehelixenetdeccom     uucpdecvaxucbvaxallegradecwrlhelixenetsontakke sontakkehelixenetdecwrldeccom

       i also experience this kinda problem in my 00 bmw 000 during cold start ups the clutch seems to be sticky and everytime i drive out for about 0km the clutch seems to stick onto somewhere that if i depress the clutch the whole chassis moves along but after preheating it becomes smooth again i think that your suggestion of being some humudity is right but there should be some remedy i also found out that my clutch is already thin but still alright for a couple grand more

   ive owned a saturn for and year and a half and didnt have the extended warranty but just traded it in for a 0000 for reasons that i wont mention unless someone wants to know  i opted for the 0 year00000 mile extended with 00 deductible  its sorta like buying health insurance  you could say that youre not sick now and havent been sick for a while but you cant guarantee that you wont be sick tomorrow  a little money invested today is better than being sick tomorrow and now being able to pay for it or having to pay a lot more tomorrow than you can today  justify all you want  extended warranties are a ripoff high profit item for the dealer  and you didnt buy 0yr00k you get 0yr00k free so what you bought is 0yr00k  and you still have to pay 00 every time you use this  great warranty  better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs ifwhen you need it  considering that your last car was only 00 years old are you sure you will even keep this new one past its free warranty period btw typical profit on extended warranties is around 00  thats right only 00 of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future repairs that the group of extendedwarrantypeople collect   
   and bythe way 00 and camaro both have drums on the rear breaks  hello  this is the 00 s   vlasis theodore  good point  you would think by now that most car companies would just make 0 wheel disc standard and be done with it  can it really cost that much more for disc  especially when you think of the economies of scale they would gain by just making them all 0 wheel disc  no seperate parts numbers and orders  etc  btw the z00 and trans am and formula have 0wheel disc but the bottom line models have the rear drums

  with spring upon us its time to start waxing again  i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions about waxes and polishes  i know carnuba wax is often  recommended on the net but i was wondering about the colored waxes to cover up some minor scratches  do the colored waxes give on overall good quality shine are they good for the paint or clear coat  what about liquid glass is it a clear polish which dries clear thus filling scratches  is it good for the paintclear coat  please post with both good and bad experiences  and hey lets name names  brands here     all gimmicks  stick with plain ol carnauba wax thats nonabrasive eagle 0 meguiars turtle wax and a few others are good examples the colored waxes just color in the scratches so theyre not so  apparent  the better approach is to buff minor scratches completely off with a cleanermild abrasive  never tried liquid glass although i still have this sample they sent me a few years back   aaron
