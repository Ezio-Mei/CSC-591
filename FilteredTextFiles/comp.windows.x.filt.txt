code contest ioccc for short x x    this is not the ioccc rules though it does contain comments about x    them  the guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions x    entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are x    allowed  even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines x x    you should read the current ioccc rules prior to submitting entries x    the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines x x xwhat is new in 0000 x x    the entry format is better for us anyway  the program mkentryc x    has been updated  see entry format x x    we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c x    compiler  certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers  x    fits are no longer permitted  some of the new issues deal with  x    nonintegral array types variable number of arguments c preprocessor  x    directives and the exit function  see our likes and dislikes x x xhints and suggestions x x    you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests  see x    for more information for details on how to get previous winners x x    keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries x    may not be valid entries this year  what was unique and novel one year x    might be old the next year x x    an entry is usually examined in a number of ways  we typically apply x    a number of tests to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi trigraphs to ascii x c preprocess the source ignoring include lines x c preprocess the source ignoring define and include lines x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x    you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x    you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x    cleaned up by the c preprocessor and a c beautifier x x    your entry need not do well under all or in most tests  in certain x    cases a test is not important  entries that compete for the x    strangestmost creative source layout need not do as well as x    others in terms of their algorithm  on the other hand given x    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that x    does something interesting when you run it x x    we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules  as such we leave x    the contest open for creative rule interpretation  as in real life x    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x    is important  for this reason we often award worst abuse of the x    rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x    if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know x    in the remarks section  please note that an invitation to abuse x    is not an invitation to break  we are strict when it comes to the x    0000 byte size limit  also abusing the entry format tends to x    annoy more than amuse x x    we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries x    to attempt to exploit them  we will award worst abuse of the rules x    and then plug the hole next year  even so we will attempt to use x    the smallest plug needed if not smaller   x x    check out your program and be sure that it works  we sometimes make x    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly x    in or near the final round  on the other hand we have seen some x    of the best entries fall down because they didnt work x x    we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that x    00 is a prime number  if you do have a bug you are better off x    documenting it  noting this entry sometimes prints the 0th power x    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry  and sometimes x    a strange bugfeature can even help the entry  of course a correctly x    working entry is best x x xour likes and dislikes x x    doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old  we x    tend to see thru masses of defines due to our preprocessor tests x    that we apply  simply abusing defines or dfoobar wont go as far x    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x x    many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x xdefine d define xd foo    dont expect this to turn into define foo x xint i xj    dont use such implicit type declaration xint k x x    we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler  if you  x    must use nonansi c such as kr c you must avoid areas that result in  x    compilelink errors for ansi c compilers x x    unfortunately ansi c requires array indexes to be of integral type x    thus the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed x xint i xchar c xic    use ci instead xi0string    use stringi0 instead x x    if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x    arguments be careful systems implement valist as a wide variety x    of ways  because of this a number of operations using valist are x    not portable and must not be used x x assigning a nonvalist variable tofrom a valist variable x casting a nonvalist variable intofrom a valist variable x passing a valist variable to a function expecting a nonvalist arg x passing a nonvalist variable to a function expecting a valist arg x performing arithmetic on valist variables x using valist as a structure or union x x    in particular do not treat valist variables as if they were a char s x x    avoid using varargsh use stdargh instead x x    if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef  x    the leading  must be the first character on a line  while some x    c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading  many do not x x    because the exit function returns void on some systems entries x    must not assume that it returns an int x x    small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x    while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do x    serve a useful purpose  they are often the only program that people x    attempt to completely understand  for this reason we look for x    programs that are compact and are instructional x x    one line programs should be short one line programs say around 00 x    bytes long  getting close to 000 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x x    we tend to dislike programs that x x are very hardware specific x are very os or unx version specific x     indexstrchr differences are ok but socketstreams specific x      code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings x     it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x wont compile under both bsd or sys v unx x abusing the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi trigraphs x are longer than they need to be x are similar to previous winners x are identical to previous losers   x x    unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the x    best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x x    the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x    limit  it is one thing to make use of a several ds to help out x    but it is quite another to use 000 bytes of ds in order to x    try and squeeze the source under the size limit  you should feel x    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off x    if you show some amount of restraint x x    we allowed whitespace and in certain cases   or  do not impact x    your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x x    given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob x    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x    program we tend to favor the second version  of course a third x    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x    andor obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x x    we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest selfreplicating x    program  we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x    to be the smallest  there is nothing wrong with selfreplicating x    programs  in fact a number of winners have been selfreplicating x    you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x    know of a smaller one x x    x client entries should be as portable as possible  entries that x    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored  dont x    depend on a particular type of display  for example dont depend x    on color or a given size  dont require backing store x x    x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x    software that is not in wide spread use  we ask that such x client x    entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x    athena widget set libx00a libxawa libxmua and libxta x    dont use mtif xvew or openlok toolkits since not everyone x    has them  avoid depending on a particular window manager  not x    everyone has x00r0 and some people are stuck back in x00r0 or x    earlier so try to target x00r0 without requiring x00r0  better x    yet try to make your entry run on all version 00 x window systems x x    x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x    xdefaults  if you must do so be sure to note the required lines x    in the remark section x x    we like programs that x x are as concise and small as they need to be x do something at least quasiinteresting x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x make us laugh andor throw up   x x    some types of programs cant excel in some areas  of course your x    program doesnt have to excel in all areas but doing well in several x    areas really does help x x    we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in x    the remark section helps your chance of winning  if you had to x    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x    we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x x    be creative x x xentry format x x    in order to help us process the many entries we must request your x    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way  this format x    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the x    author from the program itself  see judging process x x    we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to x    format entries  you should be aware of the following warning that x    is found in mkentryc x xthis program attempts to implement the ioccc rules  every xattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces xan entry that conforms to the contest rules  in all cases xwhere this program differs from the contest rules the xcontest rules will be used  be sure to check with the xcontest rules before submitting an entry x x    you are not required to use mkentry  it is convenient however x    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check x    the entry against the size rules x x    if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about x    the mkentryc program please send email to the judges  see below x x    the following is a sample entry x xentry xrule0000 xfixn

compile into prog  if an entry wins we will rename x    its source and binary to avoid filename collision  by tradition x    we use the name of the entrys title followed by an optional x    digit in case of name conflicts x x    if the above entry somehow won the least likely to win award x    we would use chonglabc and chonglab x x    if your entry depends on or requires that your build source x    andor binary files be a particular name please say so in the x    remark section  if this case applies it would be be helpful x    if you did one of the following x x tell us how to change the filenames in your entry x x have the build file make copies of the files  for example x xcc progc o specialnameneed special binary x x    or  rm f specialsrccneed special source xcp progc specialsrcc xcc specialsrcc o specialname x x    or  rm f specialbuildneed special build xtail 0 build  specialbuild xsh  specialbuild x x assume that we will use the entry title  send us a version of  x  your buildprogram files that uses the name convention  you  x  should uuencode these files in data sections x x    if your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files x    please say so in the remark section  you should try to avoid x    touching your original build source and binary files  you should x    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify  this x    will allow people to regenerate your entry from scratch x x    remember that your entry may be built without a build file  we x    typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile  if the x    build file must exist say so in the remark section x x    if your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them x    into info sections  in the case of multiple info files x    use multiple info sections  if no info files are needed x    then skip the info section x x    info files are intended to be input or detailed information that x    does not fit well into the remark section  for example an x    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample x    programs for the user to compile  an entry might want to include a x    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a x    hints file x x    info files should be used only to supplement your entry  for x    example info files may provide sample input or detailed x    information about your entry  because they are supplemental x    the entry should not require them exist x x    in some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name x    conflicts  if info files should not be renamed for some reason x    say so in the remark section x x    info files must uudecode into the current directory  if they x    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a subdirectory say x    so in the remark section x x    when submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has x    a unique entry number from 0 to 0  your first entry should x    have entry number 0 x x    with the exception of the header all text outside of the entry x    format may be ignored  that is dont place text outside of the x    entry and expect the judges to see it  our decoding tools arent x    ai progs if you need tell the the something put it in the  x    remark section or send a email to the judges at x xapplepyramidsunuunethoptoadjudgesnot the address for xjudgestoadcom submitting entries x     x    the date should be given with respect to utc  some systems refer  x    to this as gmt or gmt0  the format of the date should be that as  x    returned by asctime in the c locale  an example of such a string is x xthr apr 00 000000 0000 x x    this format is similar to the output of the date0 command  the x    string does not include the timezone name before the year  on many  x    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string x xdate u a h d t 00y xdate u  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzutc date  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzgmt date  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzgmt0 date  sed e s 0000000 x x    you are allowed to updatefixrevise your entry  to do so set x    the fix line in the entry section to y instead of n x    be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be x    replaced x x xjudging process x x    entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll x x    entries are unpacked into individual directories  the email message x    is unpacked into individual files each containing x xentry section xall author sections xall info sections xbuild section xprogram section xany other text including the email message headers x x    prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be sure x    it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was x    malformed and did not unpack correctly  information from the x    author sections are not read until the judging process is x    complete and then only from entries that have won an award x x    the above process helps keep us biased foragainst any one particular x    individual  we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x    until the final awards are given  we like the surprise of finding x    out in the end who won and where they were from x x    we attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award x    because the main prize of winning is being announced we make all x    attempts to send nonwinners into oblivion  we remove all nonwinning x    files and shred all related paper  by tradition we do not even x    reveal the number of entries that we received  for the curious x    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x    winners at talks x x    after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to the x    authors of the winning entries  one reason we do this is to give x    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x    entry  they are given the chance to correct mistakes typos  we x    often accept their suggestionscomments about our remarks as well x    this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world x x    judging consists of a number of elimination rounds  during a round x    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles x    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does x    not  we also reexamine the entries that were eliminated in the x    previous round  thus an entry gets at least two readings x x    a reading consists of a number of actions x x reading the entry section x reading the uudecoded build section x reading the uudecoded program section x reading the uudecoded info sections if any x passing the source thru the c preprocessor x    shipping over any include files x performing a number of c beautifycleanup edits on the source x passing the beautified source thru the c preprocessor x    shipping over any include files x x    in later rounds other actions are performed x x linting the source x compilingbuilding the source x running the program x performing misc tests on the source and binary x x    until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 00 entries entries x    are judged on an individual basis  an entry is set aside because it x    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round x    when the number of entries thins to about 00 entries we begin to form x    award categories  entries begin to compete with each other for awards x    an entry often will compete in several categories x x    the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x    we receive  a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x strangestmost creative source layout x most useful obfuscated program x best game that is obfuscated x most creatively obfuscated program x most deceptive c code x best x client see our likes and dislikes x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rules x anything else so strange that it deserves an award x x    we do not limit ourselves to this list  for example a few entries are so x    goodbad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x    we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x x    in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of x    reducing the remaining entries typically about 00 down to 0 or 00 x    winners  often we are confident that the entries that make it into x    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x    make it  the selection of the winners out of the final round is x    less clear cut x x    sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out x    by a similar but slightly better entry  for this reason it is x    sometimes worthwhile to reenter an improved version of an entry  x    that failed to win in a previous year  this assumes of course  x    that the entry is worth improving in the first place x x    more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a x    strangecreative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest x    rules in some way x x    in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best  sometimes such x    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry  more often the x    best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x x xannouncement of winners x x    the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference  by tradition x    this is done during the latter part of the uunetioccc bof just prior to x    the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x x    winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups x x    complangc  compunixwizardsaltsources x x    in addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following x x    compsourcesd  altsourcesdmiscmisc x

are classes that provide the base functionality object   rectobj core composite constraint shell overrideshell wmshell   etc  the terms xt and intrinsics are used interchangeably   however they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the x   window system  in particular it does not include the athena   motif olit or any other widget set  without further widgets the   intrinsics are not especially useful  o a widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via xt  the   precise use is any object that is a subclass of the core class  it   is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the   object class although these are more accurately called windowless   widgets or gadgets  o xlib is the c interface to the x00 protocol  it is one layer below   the xt intrinsics  typically a widget uses relatively few xlib   functions because xt provides most such services although an   understanding of xlib helps with problems   0  software versions   the

list for compwindowsxintrinsics it is on export in contribfaqxt   0  why does my application core dump when i use signalsalarmscthreads   in brief xlib xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections  any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state  such as all the appropriate flags not yet set dangling pointers in the middle of a list traversal etc  note that the ansi c standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by xlib or xt functions  the only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler  this flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback  it is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler  as another note it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes  this effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called  another option is to open a pipe tell the event loop about the read end using xtappaddinput and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal however this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up  why dont the intrinsics deal with this problem  primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system   is that a good enough reason  i dont think so          note the article in the x journal 00 and the example in oreilly volume 0 are in error   0  how do i use a different visual than the default   this requires a more complicated answer than it should  a window has three things that are visual specific  the visual colormap and border pixmap  all widgets have their own colormap and borderpixmap resource only shell widgets have visual resources another questions deals with why shells have a visual  the default value of these resources is copyfromparent which does exactly what it says  in the shell widget copyfromparent gets evalulated as defaultvisualofscreen and defaultcolormapofscreen  when any one of the three resources is not properly set a badmatch error occurs when the window is created  they are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used    how to get this to work  there are two parts to the answer  the first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual  the second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available  the first is a little harder because youll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information     some sample code to start up an application using something other   than the default visual     to compile  cc g visualc o visual lxaw lxmu lxt lxext lx00 lm     to run  visual geometry 000x000 depth 00 visual staticcolor fg blue bg yellow     you

xtappmainloop app return 0    0  which visual should an application use   this is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual  it has to be specified by the user  if you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 00bit truecolor with an overlayplane extension or some such  why  no application runs in isolation  depending on the way a server allocates resources i may not always want your application to run in truecolor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications  i may be very upset if it chooses to run in greyscale instead of psuedocolor or just monochrome  as an example on a low end color sun server there are many different possible visuals monochrome 000 entry colormap static gray static color and a 000 truecolor  the sgi iriss offer all the above  plus 00 bit truecolor 00 bit truecolor an overlay plane   0  why do only shell widgets have a visual   this is strictly by convention  it makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell  a widget can have its own visual resource  if it does it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls xcreatewindow  you should also make this a resource that can be obtained with xtgetvalues so other widgets can find it  a reasonable value is probably xtnvisual   0  which visual depth and colormap do shells inherit   the default value for these resources are set to copyfromparent  this is interpreted as the defaultcolormapofscreen defaultdepthofscreen and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent  ie it is an applicationshellwidgetclass and the root of your widget tree  if the parent of the widget is not null then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses copyfromparent as the visual   0  ive done all the above and i still get a badmatch error  why   some resource converters improperly cache references  this was especially true of x00r0 and earlier versions of motif   0  why doesnt my widget get destroyed when i call xtdestroywidget   see section 00 of the xt specification  it eventually does get destroyed just not immediately  the intrinsics destroy a widget in a twophase process  first it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed it is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed  this way any pending x events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed  the second phase is then performed after all callbacks event handlers and actions have completed before checking for the next x event  at this point the list is traversed and each widgets memory is actually freed among other things  as some further caveatstrivia the widgets may be destroyed if the intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list  if so then the phase 0 destruction occurs immediately  also if nested event loops are used widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop   00 how do i exit but still execute the destroycallbacks   the problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used such as calling exit directly then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state  such as open sockets temporary files allocated x resources etc  this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget   widget toplevelget gw widgetgw widget to find toplevel   widgettop  for top  gw xtparent top top  xtparent top  empty  return top   void exitcallback gw closure calldata widgetgw widget  xtpointerclosure data the app specified  xtpointercalldata widget specific data   widgettoplevel  toplevel  toplevelget gw xtunmapwidget toplevel make it disappear quickly  xtdestroywidget toplevel exit 0   one can see that the above code exits immediately after destroying the toplevel widget  the trouble is the phase 0 destruction may never occur    this works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state  you might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget  which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the destroy callbacks  one alternative is to modify exitcallback to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop  however private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy and difficult to maintain

of the shell widget using xtsetvalues  the geometry change is then propagated to the shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request  however the shell must have the resource xtnallowshellresize set to true otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the shell will not resize  to change the position of a shell use xtsetvalues on the shell not the child and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted   00 why cant xtappaddinput handle files   it does however unix semantics for when io is ready for a file does not fit most peoples intuitive model  in unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read call would not block ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block  this works as expected for terminals sockets and pipes  for a file the read will always return but the return indicates an eof  ie no more data  the result is the code in the intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read  the culprit is the select system call or on sysv based oss it is the poll system call  how to get around this on a unix system  the best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file  use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to xtappaddinput  a suitable program on bsd systems is tail f filename  its rumored that select on some systems is not completely reliable  in particular   ibm aix 00 this is one where it would work for a while   several thousand times and then stop until some other   event woke it up this seemed to be the result of a race   condition in the kernel  ibm claims to have a fix for this   pyramid doesnt work at all   ultrix and possibly others where pipes are implemented as   sockets wasnt completely broken but although the writing   side wrote in 000 byte blocks the reading side received it   all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at   a time  you can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks   get raound it by detecting the situation and having   select ignore the pipe for 00 mseconds  by then it had   been given the whole block   note that all the above descriptions used unix terminology such as read file descriptor pipes etc  this is an os dependent area and may not be identical on all systems  however the intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit  why they didnt also deal with signals at this point i dont know   00 what good books and magazines are there on xt   i have a favorite that is the definitive reference  to my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into

ugly side  recently a 0d look is   available for ftp on exportlcsmiteducontribxaw0dtarz motif from osf available for a license fee and commonly shipped on   many workstation vendors platforms almost

namelanguagevendor  xviewcsun oicparcplace interviewscstanford tcltkcspriteberkeleyedu    however much i like c and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the intrinsics hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 00 years that uses an object oriented language  keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than c starts gaining acceptance   00 how do i pass a float value to xtsetvalues   first what is going wrong is the structure for an arg is essentially typdef struct      stringname     longvalue  arg  and the code argarg  xtsetarg arg name 00  expands to argarg  argname  name argvalue  00  you can see that with normal c type conversions the argvalue gets the integer 0 instead of the floating point value 00  when the value is copied into the widget resource the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value  so how to get around this  the following macro is from the athena widgets document and i am now recomending it over the previous suggestions  define xtsetfloatargarg n d      if sizeoffloat  sizeofxtargval           xtsetargarg n d       else           xtargval ld  xtargval d          xtsetargarg n ld          00 how do i write a resource converter   courtesy of rich thomson rthomsondsdescom  the following discussion of resource converters assumes r0 or r0 intrinsics  resource converters changed between r0 and r0 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values  there are several main types of resource converters      string to data type     data type to string     data type to data type  i string to data type     usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings     that will be converted to data type values  this is most often     used to map enumerated names to enumerated values  namevalue true0 false0      in this case the string to data type converter needs to compare     the resource value to the list of fixed strings  this is most     readily accomplished by the use of the quark mechanism of the     resource manager  the resource value is turned into a quark     which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a     single word  then the resource quark is compared against the     quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values      if there are many enumerated strings in the converter or many     converters each with a small number of enumeration strings then     a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the     resource strings into quarks  that way the first time one of     these converters is used the strings will be turned into quarks     and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one     of the converters  ii data type to string     this type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data     type converters since the use of quarks isnt necessary  instead     the data type value is simply converted to a string value     probably by the use of sprintf      data type to string converters are useful for applications that     wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that     they can write out a valid resource specification to a file  this     mechanism can be used to provide a snapshot of application state     into a file  this snapshot can be used to restore the program to     a known state via the usual x resource database mechanisms      if you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type     converter it isnt much extra effort to write the data type to     string converter  writing both at the same time helps to ensure     that they are consistent  iii data type to data type     this type of converter is used to convert an existing data type     value to another data type  for instance an x pixel value can be     converted to an rgb data type that contains separate fields for     red green and blue   the type signature for a resource converter is as follows  typedef boolean xttypeconverterdisplay  xrmvalueptr cardinal  xrmvalueptr xrmvalueptr xtpointer      display dpy     xrmvalueptr args     cardinal numargs     xrmvalueptr fromval     xrmvalueptr toval     xtpointer converterdata  when the converter is invoked the fromval argument points to the source x resource manager value and the toval argument points to the destination x resource manager value  the converterdata argument is an opaque pointer to some converterspecific data that is specified when the converter is registered  the args and numargs arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked  for instance the pixel to rgb structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the pixel to obtain the rgb values corresponding to that pixel  care must be taken with the toval argument  an xrmvalue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value  typedef struct      unsigned int    size     caddrt         addr  xrmvalue xrmvalueptr  when the converter is invoked the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be null in the former case the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value  if the destination area is not large enough then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return false  the caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter  if the size is large enough then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return true  if the location is null then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return true  when writing a group of converters this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro      define donevar type        if tovaladdr      if tovalsize  sizeoftype              tovalsize  sizeoftype        return false          else      type  tovaladdr  var          else  tovaladdr  caddrt var        tovalsize  sizeoftype        return true      define donestrstr        if tovaladdr  tovalsize  sizeofstring      tovalsize  sizeofstring    return false          else  tovaladdr  caddrt str        tovalsize  sizeofstring        return true  inside the converter it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the numargs and args arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly  once you have written your converter you need to register it with the intrinsics  the intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database  to register a converter with a single application context use xtappsettypeconverter  void xtappsettypeconvertercontext from to converter args numargs cache destructor     xtappcontext context     string from     string to     xttypeconverter converter     xtconvertarglist args     cardinal numargs     xtcachetype cache     xtdestructor destructor  to register a converter with all application contexts use xtsettypeconverter  void xtsettypeconverterfrom to converter args numargs cache destructor     string from     string to     xttypeconverter converter     xtconvertarglist args     cardinal numargs     xtcachetype cache     xtdestructor destructor  in the r0 intrinsics there were the routines xtappaddconverter and xtaddconverter these have been superseded by xtappsettypeconverter and xtsettypeconverter  whenever possible the newer routines should be used  when a converter is registered with the intrinsics a cache argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached      xtcachenonedont cache any converted values     xtcacheallcache all converted values     xtcachebydisplaycache converted values on a per display basis  caching converted values that require a roundtrip to the server is a good idea for instance string to pixel conversions  the destructor argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed  xtdestructor has the following type definition  typedef void xtdestructorxtappcontext xrmvalueptr xtpointer xrmvalueptr cardinal      xtappcontext context     xrmvalueptr to     xtpointer converterdata     xrmvalueptr args     cardinal numargs  the destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the to argument but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the to argument itself toaddr  the destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed for instance colormap and visual arguments for the string to pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated pixel from the colormap as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered  sample converter code can be found in the following files in the mit r0 distribution      mitlibxtconvertersc     contriblibpextconvertersc     contriblibpextconvertersh   00 how do i open multiple displays   see multiuser application software using xt the x resource issue 0 summer 0000 by oliver jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved  most of this answer is based on that article  in a nutshell one uses xtopendisplay to add each display to a single application context and then xtclosedisplay to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context  the real problems occur when trying to close down a display  this can happen 0 ways 0 user selects a quit button on one of the displays 0 user has window manager send a wmdeletewindow message 0 server disconnect  possibly from a killclient message    server shutdowncrash or network failure  ill assume you can deal gracefully with 0  0 since it is merely a problem of translating a widget to a display and removing that display  if not then read the oliver jones article  the third one is difficult to handle  the following is based on the oliver jones article and i include it here because it is a difficult problem  the difficulty arises because the xlib design presumed that an io error is always unrecoverable and so fatal  this is essentially true for a single display x based application but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an x server  when an x io error occurs the io error handler is called and if it returns then an exit happens  the only way around this is to use setjmplongjmp to avoid returning to the io error handler  the following code fragment demonstrates this  include setjmph jmpbuf xiorecover  void xiohandler dpy displaydpy  destroydisplay dpy longjmp xiorecover 0   main    if setjmp xiorecover  0 xsetioerrorhandler xiohandler xtappmainloop appcontext   the destroydisplay is something that given a display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup  it should also call xtclosedisplay  for those of you unfamiliar with setjmplongjmp when setjmp is first called it returns a 0 and saves enough information in the jmpbuf that a latter execution of longjmp can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp was just executed  the return value of this second setjmp is the value of the second argument to longjmp  there are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate  some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources  the most likely symptoms are xlib errors such as badcolor badatom or badfont  there may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 00 being a typical value  you may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display  there was much discussion in compwindowsx about this topic in november of 00  robert scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and xlib will not change   00 what changed from r0 to r0 to r0   this addresses only changes in the intrinsics  first the general changes for each release are described

resources of a widget are filled in from the following places from highest priority to lowest priority  0 args passed at creation time 0 command line arguments 0 users per host defaults file 0 users defaults file 0 users per application default file 0 system wide per application default file  note that 00 are read only once on application startup  the result of steps 00 is a single resource database used for further queries  the per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer  this file is either specified with the xenvironment environment variable or if that is not set then the file homexdefaultshost is used  the user defaults file is either obtained from the resourcemanager property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file homexdefaults is used  typically the program xrdb is used to set the resourcemanager property  please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property  a size of around 00kbyte is reasonable  some toolkits may track changes to the resourcemanager but most do not  a user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application  the intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found  read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found  the system wide per application default files are typically found in usrlibx00appdefaults  if such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used  the intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found  read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found  thanks to oliver jones ojpictelcom for the following 000  you can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your xtbased programs  xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and xapplresdir  these environment variables control where xt looks for applicationdefaults files as an application is initializing  xt loads at most one appdefaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath  set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a way that appdefaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies  suppose for example that you are running suns open windows and you also have some r0 x applications installed in usrlibx00appdefaults you could set a value like this for xfilesearchpath and it would cause xt to look up appdefaults files in both usrlibx00 and usropenwinlib or wherever your openwinhome is located  setenv xfilesearchpath usrlibx00tnopenwinhomelibtn  the value of this environment variable is a colonseparated list of pathnames  the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see xtresolvepathname  nthe value of the filename parameter or the applications class name tthe value of the file type  in this case the literal string appdefaults ccustomization resource r0 only ssuffix  none for appdefaults llanguage locale and codeset eg jajpeuc llanguage part of l  eg ja tthe territory part of the displays language string cthe codeset part of the displays language string  lets take apart the example  suppose the applications class name is myterm also suppose open windows is installed in usropenwin notice the example omits localespecific lookup  usrlibx00tn        means usrlibx00appdefaultsmyterm openwinhomelibtn    means usropenwinlibappdefaultsmyterm  as the application initializes xt tries to open both of the above appdefaults files in the order shown  as soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for others  the effect of this path is to search first in usrlibx00 then in usropenwin  lets consider another example this time lets set xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file mytermad in the current working directory then for myterm in the directory appdefaults  setenv xuserfilesearchpath nadhomeappdefaultsn  the first path in the list expands to mytermad  the second expands to homeappdefaultsmyterm  this is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the imake convention of naming the appdefaults file mytermad in the applications source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly  note when looking for appdefault files with xuserfilesearchpath       for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is       defined so t and s are useless  with r0 theres another twist  you may specify a customization resource value  for example you might run the myterm application like this  myterm xrm customization color  if one of your pathname specifications had the value usrlibx00appdefaultsnc then the expanded pathname would be usrlibx00appdefaultsmytermcolor because the c substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource  the default xfilesearchpath compiled into xt is  usrlibx00ltnc  r0 usrlibx00ltnc  r0 usrlibx00tnc     r0 usrlibx00ltn usrlibx00ltn usrlibx00tn  note some sites replace usrlibx00 with a projectroot in this batch of default settings  the default xuserfilesearchpath also compiled into xt is   rootlnc  r0 rootlnc  r0 rootnc     r0 rootln rootln rootn  root is either the value of xapplresdir or the users home directory if xapplresdir is not set  if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other than the default xt ignores xapplresdir altogether  notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your appdefaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir to  a single dot  in r0 all this machinery worked differently for r0 compatibilty many people set their xapplresdir value to  a dot followed by a slash    00 what order are callbacks executed in  courtesy of donna converse converseexpolcsmitedu 00000  the intrinsics library do not guarantee an order  this is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list  neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution  the application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list  even though the xt standard in the definition of xtaddcallback says   callbackname specifies the callback list to which the  procedure is to be appended   you may not infer from the word appended that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list   00 how do i know if a widget is visible  courtesy of donna converse converseexpolcsmitedu 00000   i am building a widget needs to know if it is visible i set the visible  interest field in core and if my window is completely obscured the core  visible flag goes false however if my window is iconified the flag  stays set to true  right everything is implemented correctly  this demonstrates a deficiency in the x protocol and the core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol  the deficiency is that the information is available in one way in this case an inconvenient way  the xt specification is accurate in the second and third paragraphs of section 0000 so read this section carefully  the visible field will not change in response to iconification  a visibilitynotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable that is when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped that is when iconification occurs  this is the protocol deficiency visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the x protocol see the glossary in your xlib and x protocol reference manual   is this a problem with mwm or is there something  else which needs to be done  youll see this with any window manager with no window manager   if the problem is mwm what is the fastest  way to determine if a window is iconified   as an application writer keep track with a global boolean in an action routine with translations for mapnotify and unmapnotify on the shell widget which contains your custom widget  as the custom widget writer see the mapstate field returned by a call to xgetwindowattributes  these are suggestions   00 how do i reparent a widget in xt ie xtreparentwidget   you cant   00 why use xtmalloc xtfree etc   unfortunately most code that calls malloc realloc or calloc tends to ignore the possibility of returning null  at best it is handled something like  ptr  type  malloc sizeof type if ptr  perror malloc in xyzzy exit 0  to handle this common case the intrinsics define the functions xtmalloc xtcalloc xtnew xtnewstring and xtrealloc which all use the standard c language functions malloc calloc and realloc but execute xterrormsg if a null value is returned  xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits  in addition if xtrealloc is called with a null pointer it uses xtmalloc to get the initial space  this allows code like  if ptr ptr  type  malloc sizeof type else ptr  type  realloc ptr sizeof type  count  0 count  to be written as  ptr  xtrealloc ptr sizeof ptr  count  also xtfree accepts a null pointer as an argument  generally ive found the xt functions conveniant to use  however anytime im allocating anything potentially large i use the standard functions so i can fully recover from not enough memory errors  xtnew and xtnewstring are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string    struct abc xyzzy   char     ptr   char     str  abcdef    xyzzy  xtnew struct abc takes care of type casting    ptr  xtnewstring str  a strict interpretation of the intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc and free  ie code such as   char      ptr   ptr  xtmalloc 000      free ptr  may not work  personally id call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor  a common error for motif programmers is to use xtfree on a string when they should really be using xmstringfree   00 how to debug an xt application  first id recomend getting purify from pure software  this is a great package for tracing memory problems on suns  its a bit pricey at 0000 but id still recomend it  excuse the marketing blurb contact supportpurecom for more info  purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into the object code produced by existing compilers  these instructions check every memory read and write performed by the program under test and detect several types of access errors such as reading unitialized memory writing past mallocd bounds or writing to freed memory  purify inserts checking logic into all of the code in a program including third party and vendor objectcode libraries and verifies system call interfaces  in addition purify tracks memory usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel adaption of garbage collection techniques  purifys nearly comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program down typically by a factor of two to five  an alternative package that isnt as pricey 000 for a sun runs on many unixs and has pretty similar features is the sentinel debugging environment  this replaces malloc and several other c library functions to add additional checks  contact cpcahilvirtechvticom for more info  next if you are getting any sort of xlib error youll need to run in synchronous mode easily accomplished with the sync command line argument or by setting the variable xdebug to 0 with your debugger  then set a break point in exit  this will let you trace back to the original xlib function being called  if you dont run in synchronous mode then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to xlib previously since the xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous  next if you are having trouble with window layout you can use the undocumented resource xtidentifywindows or the class resource xtdebug to cause the widget name to be identified with each window for example      example xload xrm xtdebugtrue      example xwininfo tree      click in new xload window  will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included  this can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets  next if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages its children you can try exportlcsmiteducontriblibxtgeotarz  this acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both  its a very clever idea  the most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse such as from a pulldown menu  the server effectively locks up and youll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually  the server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands unfortunately you cant give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped  the best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk running the program under a debugger or other environment on one machine and running the application on the other possibly using a command sequence like this  othermachine xhost thismachine thismachine setenv display othermachine0 thismachine gdb application your favorite debugger or this othermachine xhost thismachine thismachine gdb application gdb set environment display othermachine0 gdb run   i believe codecenter a c interpretergraphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints  debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work  you can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works  judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal   00 why dont xtaddinput xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc work     i have got a delicate problem with the three routines xtaddinput    xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc the problem i have is that when    i use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly    i have made a handy little testprogram where everything works    perfect but in my real application nothing happens   the introduction in r0 of the xtapp functions obsoleted those routines see q00 for other changes in r0 r0 and r0  what happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created  since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts you wont get those events  for example   cnt  0 toplevel  xtappinitializeapp class    desc xtnumber desc    argc argv    fallback args cnt  xtaddtimeout  xtaddworkproc   xtappmainloop app  would never invoke the timeout   00 what is and how can i implement drag and drop  courtesy of roger reynolds rogerrnetcomcom 00 feb 00  dragndrop is a buzzword for moving data between clients in an intuitive fashion  motif version 00 supports dragndrop capabilities openlook has supported dnd all along  the two protocols are not compatable with each other and so far as i know they are not published  i wrote a package called rdd which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag n drop operations between clients  my intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a standard dragndrop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell regardless of what widget set is used as long as it is based on xt  the implementation is based upon my understanding of the icccm conventions for more details read the code  i have heard from dozens of people using rdd who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than motif 00 stuff  also there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use motif anyway  the latest rdd and some other stuff is available for ftp from netcomcom in pubrogerr  a possibly older version is also available on exportlcsmitedu in contrib   pete warewarecisohiostateedu cis dept ohio state

  hi   im trying to write a motif program on an interactive unix machine and im observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a drawingarea namely some xlib operations work and some do not in particular the expose consist of two xfillrectangle calls followed by some xdrawpoint calls and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is clicked on and moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area but after the move is still on some part of the drawing area this also happens less consistently when the pulldownpopup is moved in the leftward direction  assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd is this a server bug  thanks  zack t smith

if you remain within the guidelines x x    you should read the current ioccc rules prior to submitting entries x    the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines x x    changes from the 0000

entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c x    compiler  certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers x    fits are no longer permitted  some of the new issues deal with x    nonintegral array types variable number of arguments c preprocessor x    directives and the exit function  see our likes and dislikes x x xhints and suggestions x x    you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests  see x    for more information for details on how to get previous winners x x    keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries x    may not be valid entries this year  what was unique and novel one year x    might be old the next year x x    an entry is usually examined in a number of ways  we typically apply x    a number of tests to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi trigraphs to ascii x c preprocess the source ignoring include lines x c preprocess the source ignoring define and include lines x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x    you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x    you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x    cleaned up by the c preprocessor and a c beautifier x x    your entry need not do well under all or in most tests  in certain x    cases a test is not important  entries that compete for the x    strangestmost creative source layout need not do as well as x    others in terms of their algorithm  on the other hand given x    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that x    does something interesting when you run it x x    we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules  as such we leave x    the contest open for creative rule interpretation  as in real life x    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x    is important  for this reason we often award worst abuse of the x    rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x    if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know x    in the remarks section  please note that an invitation to abuse x    is not an invitation to break  we are strict when it comes to the x    0000 byte size limit  also abusing the entry format tends to x    annoy more than amuse x x    we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries x    to attempt to exploit them  we will award worst abuse of the rules x    and then plug the hole next year  even so we will attempt to use x    the smallest plug needed if not smaller   x x    check out your program and be sure that it works  we sometimes make x    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly x    in or near the final round  on the other hand we have seen some x    of the best entries fall down because they didnt work x x    we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that x    00 is a prime number  if you do have a bug you are better off x    documenting it  noting this entry sometimes prints the 0th power x    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry  and sometimes x    a strange bugfeature can even help the entry  of course a correctly x    working entry is best x x xour likes and dislikes x x    doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old  we x    tend to see thru masses of defines due to our preprocessor tests x    that we apply  simply abusing defines or dfoobar wont go as far x    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x x    many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x xdefine d define xd foo    dont expect this to turn into define foo x xint i xj    dont use such implicit type declaration xint k x x    we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler  if you x    must use nonansi c such as kr c you must avoid areas that result in x    compilelink errors for ansi c compilers x x    unfortunately some ansi c compilers require array indexes to be of        x    integral type  thus the following classical obfuscation hacks should     x    not be used in 0000  this rule may be relaxed in future contests       x xint i xchar c xic    use ci instead xi0string    use stringi0 instead x x    if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x    arguments be careful systems implement valist as a wide variety x    of ways  because of this a number of operations using valist are x    not portable and must not be used x x assigning a nonvalist variable tofrom a valist variable x casting a nonvalist variable intofrom a valist variable x passing a valist variable to a function expecting a nonvalist arg x passing a nonvalist variable to a function expecting a valist arg x performing arithmetic on valist variables x using valist as a structure or union x x    in particular do not treat valist variables as if they were a char s x x    avoid using varargsh use stdargh instead x x    if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef  x    the leading  must be the first character on a line  while some x    c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading  many do not x x    because the exit function returns void on some systems entries x    must not assume that it returns an int x x    small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x    while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do x    serve a useful purpose  they are often the only program that people x    attempt to completely understand  for this reason we look for x    programs that are compact and are instructional x x    one line programs should be short one line programs say around 00 x    bytes long  getting close to 000 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x x    we tend to dislike programs that x x are very hardware specific x are very os or unx version specific x     indexstrchr differences are ok but socketstreams specific x      code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings x     it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x wont compile under both bsd or sys v unx x abusing the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi trigraphs x are longer than they need to be x are similar to previous winners x are identical to previous losers   x x    unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the x    best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x x    the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x    limit  it is one thing to make use of a several ds to help out x    but it is quite another to use 000 bytes of ds in order to x    try and squeeze the source under the size limit  you should feel x    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off x    if you show some amount of restraint x x    we allowed whitespace and in certain cases   or  do not impact x    your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x x    given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob x    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x    program we tend to favor the second version  of course a third x    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x    andor obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x x    we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest selfreplicating x    program  we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x    to be the smallest  there is nothing wrong with selfreplicating x    programs  in fact a number of winners have been selfreplicating x    you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x    know of a smaller one x x    x client entries should be as portable as possible  entries that x    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored  dont x    depend on a particular type of display  for example dont depend x    on color or a given size  dont require backing store x x    x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x    software that is not in wide spread use  we ask that such x client x    entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x    athena widget set libx00a libxawa libxmua and libxta x    dont use mtif xvew or openlok toolkits since not everyone x    has them  avoid depending on a particular window manager  not x    everyone has x00r0 and some people are stuck back in x00r0 or x    earlier so try to target x00r0 without requiring x00r0  better x    yet try to make your entry run on all version 00 x window systems x x    x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x    xdefaults  if you must do so be sure to note the required lines x    in the remark section x x    we like programs that x x are as concise and small as they need to be x do something at least quasiinteresting x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x make us laugh andor throw up   x x    some types of programs cant excel in some areas  of course your x    program doesnt have to excel in all areas but doing well in several x    areas really does help x x    we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in x    the remark section helps your chance of winning  if you had to x    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x    we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x x    be creative x x xentry format x x    in order to help us process the many entries we must request your x    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way  this format x    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the x    author from the program itself  see judging process x x    we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to x    format entries  you should be aware of the following warning that x    is found in mkentryc x xthis program attempts to implement the ioccc rules  every xattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces xan entry that conforms to the contest rules  in all cases xwhere this program differs from the contest rules the xcontest rules will be used  be sure to check with the xcontest rules before submitting an entry x x    you are not required to use mkentry  it is convenient however x    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check x    the entry against the size rules x x    if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about x    the mkentryc program please send email to the

assume that the source is progc x    and will compile into prog  if an entry wins we will rename x    its source and binary to avoid filename collision  by tradition x    we use the name of the entrys title followed by an optional x    digit in case of name conflicts x x    if the above entry somehow won the least likely to win award x    we would use chonglabc and chonglab x x    if your entry depends on or requires that your build source x    andor binary files be a particular name please say so in the x    remark section  if this case applies it would be be helpful x    if you did one of the following x x tell us how to change the filenames in your entry x x have the build file make copies of the files  for example x xcc progc o specialnameneed special binary x x    or  rm f specialsrccneed special source xcp progc specialsrcc xcc specialsrcc o specialname x x    or  rm f specialbuildneed special build xtail 0 build  specialbuild xsh  specialbuild x x assume that we will use the entry title  send us a version of x  your buildprogram files that uses the name convention  you x  should uuencode these files in data sections x x    if your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files x    please say so in the remark section  you should try to avoid x    touching your original build source and binary files  you should x    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify  this x    will allow people to regenerate your entry from scratch x x    remember that your entry may be built without a build file  we x    typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile  if the x    build file must exist say so in the remark section x x    if your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them x    into info sections  in the case of multiple info files x    use multiple info sections  if no info files are needed x    then skip the info section x x    info files are intended to be input or detailed information that x    does not fit well into the remark section  for example an x    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample x    programs for the user to compile  an entry might want to include a x    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a x    hints file x x    info files should be used only to supplement your entry  for x    example info files may provide sample input or detailed x    information about your entry  because they are supplemental x    the entry should not require them exist x x    in some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name x    conflicts  if info files should not be renamed for some reason x    say so in the remark section x x    info files must uudecode into the current directory  if they x    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a subdirectory say x    so in the remark section x x    when submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has x    a unique entry number from 0 to 0  your first entry should x    have entry number 0 x x    with the exception of the header all text outside of the entry x    format may be ignored  that is dont place text outside of the x    entry and expect the judges to see it  our decoding tools arent x    ai progs if you need tell the the something put it in the x    remark section or send a email to the judges at x xapplepyramidsunuunethoptoadjudgesnot the address for xjudgestoadcom submitting entries x x    the date should be given with respect to utc  some systems refer x    to this as gmt or gmt0  the format of the date should be that as x    returned by asctime in the c locale  an example of such a string is x xthr apr 00 000000 0000 x x    this format is similar to the output of the date0 command  the x    string does not include the timezone name before the year  on many x    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string x xdate u a h d t 00y xdate u  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzutc date  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzgmt date  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzgmt0 date  sed e s 0000000 x x    you are allowed to updatefixrevise your entry  to do so set x    the fix line in the entry section to y instead of n x    be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be x    replaced x x xjudging process x x    entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll x x    entries are unpacked into individual directories  the email message x    is unpacked into individual files each containing x xentry section xall author sections xall info sections xbuild section xprogram section xany other text including the email message headers x x    prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be sure x    it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was x    malformed and did not unpack correctly  information from the x    author sections are not read until the judging process is x    complete and then only from entries that have won an award x x    the above process helps keep us biased foragainst any one particular x    individual  we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x    until the final awards are given  we like the surprise of finding x    out in the end who won and where they were from x x    we attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award x    because the main prize of winning is being announced we make all x    attempts to send nonwinners into oblivion  we remove all nonwinning x    files and shred all related paper  by tradition we do not even x    reveal the number of entries that we received  for the curious x    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x    winners at talks x x    after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to the x    authors of the winning entries  one reason we do this is to give x    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x    entry  they are given the chance to correct mistakes typos  we x    often accept their suggestionscomments about our remarks as well x    this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world x x    judging consists of a number of elimination rounds  during a round x    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles x    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does x    not  we also reexamine the entries that were eliminated in the x    previous round  thus an entry gets at least two readings x x    a reading consists of a number of actions x x reading the entry section x reading the uudecoded build section x reading the uudecoded program section x reading the uudecoded info sections if any x passing the source thru the c preprocessor x    shipping over any include files x performing a number of c beautifycleanup edits on the source x passing the beautified source thru the c preprocessor x    shipping over any include files x x    in later rounds other actions are performed x x linting the source x compilingbuilding the source x running the program x performing misc tests on the source and binary x x    until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 00 entries entries x    are judged on an individual basis  an entry is set aside because it x    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round x    when the number of entries thins to about 00 entries we begin to form x    award categories  entries begin to compete with each other for awards x    an entry often will compete in several categories x x    the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x    we receive  a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x strangestmost creative source layout x most useful obfuscated program x best game that is obfuscated x most creatively obfuscated program x most deceptive c code x best x client see our likes and dislikes x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rules x anything else so strange that it deserves an award x x    we do not limit ourselves to this list  for example a few entries are so x    goodbad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x    we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x x    in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of x    reducing the remaining entries typically about 00 down to 0 or 00 x    winners  often we are confident that the entries that make it into x    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x    make it  the selection of the winners out of the final round is x    less clear cut x x    sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out x    by a similar but slightly better entry  for this reason it is x    sometimes worthwhile to reenter an improved version of an entry x    that failed to win in a previous year  this assumes of course x    that the entry is worth improving in the first place x x    more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a x    strangecreative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest x    rules in some way x x    in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best  sometimes such x    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry  more often the x    best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x x xannouncement of winners x x    the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference  by tradition x    this is done during the latter part of the uunetioccc bof just prior to x    the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x x

  i might have a need in the future to display rotated text  i noticed the xvertext package on the net  it looks very good but it has one slight problem  the api to it assumes you have a font name not an already loaded font  it shouldnt be too difficult to split up the function into two interface routines one with a font name and one with an xfontstruct but i thought i would ask the author alan richardson mppa0ukacsussexsyma first in case he was planning this already unfortunately his email address bounced  does alan r or the current maintainer of xvertext see this  the email address you mentioned above is for use with the uk  as you know the brits do everything backwards   so the real address from the states is  mppa0symasussexacuk  give it a try   harvard   ucbvaxuwvaxastroatcftmsbrown  or  uu0psicomftmsbrown rutgers internet brownwiextrelcom  or  ftmsbrownastroatcuucpcswiscedu

  i have a program produces a continuous tone by calling xbell repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell if it is run more than once on a display the tones are buffered in the x server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program have exited is there a convenient way of preventing this eg by emptying the x server bell buffer when each program exits  disclaimer please note that the above is a personal view and should not    be construed as an official comment from the jet project  
      in my opinion a programming degree is still worth having   yes but a cs degree is not a programming degree does anybody know of a computing course where programming is taught  computer science is a branch of maths or the course i did was  ive also done a software engineering course  much more practical and likely to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think they want but also did not teach programming the ability to program was an entry requirement  at robert gordon university programming was the main most timeconsuming  start of the course the first two years consisted of five subjects software engineering pascalcunix computer engineering 0000000000000  assembler computer theory lispprolog mathematicsstatistics and  communication skills how to pass interviewsintelligence tests and group discussions eg how to survive a helicopter crash in the north sea the third year industrial placement was spent working for a computer company  for a year the company could be anywhere in europe there was a special  travel allowance scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors   the fourth year included operating systemscmodula0 software engineering  c0000 assembler real time laboratory c00000 assembler and computing  theory lisp  there were also group projects in 0nd and 0th years where  students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an  outside company the only disadvantage being that specifications would change  suddenly   in the first four years there was a 0000 weighting between courseworks and  exams for most subjects however in the honours year this was reduced to a  0000 split between an individual project and final exams no coursework  assessment  are all computer science courses like this  btw  we started off with 00 students in our first year and were left with 0 by honours year also every course is tutored separately not easy trying to sleep when you are in 0 student class    cheers   michael     michael s a robb      tel 00 00 000 0000   the problem with bolton  software engineer       fax 00 00 000 0000    software is making sure the  spider systems limited  email                 bolts are the right size  edinburgh eh0 0ng      michaelrspidercouk               anonymous

around this problem the patch is on export in 000 contribx00r0sunos000patchversion0z   i used gcc to compile the whole distribution but i get several segmentation faults when running x  note first that gcc on risc machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 000x0 or vax platforms  here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing  structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when  gcccompiled parts of x are linked with sunsupplied functions that pass or  return structs runtime errors occur  affected programs include rgb and  the server  this is from the gcc manual  on the sparc gnu cc uses an incompatible calling convention for  structures  it passes them by including their contents in the argument list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by  reference  this really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet supported in gnu cc so it isnt straightforward to fix it  the convention for structure returning is also incompatible and fpccstructreturn does not help  you can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags    files which need to be compiled using cc include serveros00bsdoscolorc  rgbrgbc  in addition several of the inet functions use structs as args or return values   clientsxhostxhostc  clientsxauthgethostc  calls to inetaddr in libclxsocketc and libxxconndisc are possibly  harmless as they dont involve structs  collected by bashfordscrippsedu don bashford 000   when i try to run xinit or the xsun server i get the error  getting interface configuration operation not supported on socket  fatal server bug no screens found  running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didnt work you can do  this simple test  include sysioctlh siocgifconf  run that through cc e and gcc e  the last line of output is the piece of  interest it should be identical modulo irrelevant differences like  whitespace  if the gcc version has x where the cc version has i your  fixincludes run didnt work for some reason or other go back to your gcc sources and run fixincludes then rebuild the x distribution if they are  identical try running a make clean in mitserver and rebuilding just to make  sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files    courtesy der mouse mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu 000   in mitserverddxsunsuncg0cc we have found missing defines for  cg0acmonolen cg0bcmonolen cg0acenblen cg0bcenblen what should these be  the r0 errata list distributed after x00r0 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older sunos versions eg 00 to compile         define cg0acmonolen 0000000         define cg0acenblen  cg0acmonolen         define cg0bcmonolen cg0acmonolen         define cg0bcenblen  cg0acmonolen  however the sun0 should not actually ever have the cg0 device and so  references to it can be removed from mitserverddxsunsuninitc and the  imakefile  0000   the file sundevcg0regh isnt being found  sun omitted sundevcg0regh from sunos 000 remove the include  from suncg0cc and replace it with the line  define cg0vaddrcolor   0x00000000 the file has changed from earlier versions of sunos and should not be copied  from another distribution   all of the executables that i try to run have the following results ldso libxmuso0 not found or even ldso call to undefined procedure gethostname from 0xf000a00c  if you are building with shared libraries on a sun remember that you  need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries if youve installed x on a fileserver run it on the servers clients too  while  building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing x shared libraries you might have eg those  distributed with openwindows  you should make sure you do not have  ldlibrarypath set in your environment during the build or the installation   if you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in usrlib usrlocallib or  usr0lib for these programs to work or else those programs must be linked  statically courtesy mit x consortium note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been installed you can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically pass bstatic to most c compilers    this is a bug in the olit  xtqstring was an external symbol that existed in  x00r0 upon which ow 00s libxt is based  it wasnt documented and was  removed in x00r0 mits guarantee of upward compatibility between the r0 and r0 libraries only applied to the documented interface    a workaround is to temporarily set your ldlibrarypath to point to the x00r0 or openwindows xt library that you linked the program against  0000 from barry margolin barmarthinkcom 000 from jeff francis  jpfheliocentriccom    there is a security problem with certain r0 clients xterm and xload running under sunos 00 that have been installed setuid root and are using  shared libraries to avoid the problem do one of these 0 make the program nonsetuid you should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources eg ptys and devkmem used by these programs to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site 0 relink the programs statically using bstatic 0 install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries  from rwsexpolcsmitedu bob scheifler 0000  the r0 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newlyinstalled libraries when xterm is being installed this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from nfsmounted disks  xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem    on many systems the framebuffer is unsecured by default this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the framebuffer directly or as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying to accidentally start up a second x session on your console  display check the man page for fbtab0  thanks to art mulder artcsualbertaca 000     imake is not a replacement for the make program instead it is a makefilegenerator that takes advantages of the includefile and macro processing capabilities of the c preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles  suitable for building software on a particular system although it is not  specific to x the x release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by which the systemspecific configuration files systemindependent configuration files and individual imakefiles are melded to produce a makefile is not  obvious there have been several different versions of imake the r0 r0 and r0 versions are different  you can obtain information on imake from these sources  the r0 and r0 release notes and imake man page include information on using imake to build x  the r0 and r0 file mitconfigreadme also contains useful information  on the r0 tapes contribdocimakeimaketex is mark moraes r0r0 guide to imake  the r0 mitdocconfigusenixwspaperms contains a paper by jim fulton on an early version of imake  paul dubois

 sasun0epflchpubimakefile0z  0000000000000    versions are distributed with the r0 and r0 releases an earlier  version is distributed with the x00r0 release some thirdparty toolkits  redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the  template and configuration files there are no real standards for such  configuration files although most current contributed software expects the  templates distributed with x00r0 export contains the r0 distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution a standalone version of imake but one stemming from x00r0 is in ftpgermanyeunetpubx00miscimakeimakepuretarz 0000000000    if you have r0 or r0 installed on your system run xmkmf this is a  script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments the output is a  makefile configured for your system and based on the imakefile then run make  which will use that new makefile to compile the program   when i try to compile certain programs i get the following link error undefined xshapequeryextension xshapecombinemask  these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x shape which was introduced in the mit x00r0 distribution and allows nonrectangular windows  like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it  prex00r0 servers as well as many  vendorsupplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway  in order to use the shape extension you must link to the library  libxexta  in the x00r0 distribution this library and the associated includes will be in the mitextensions directory  if you do not have these files do  not despair  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be  compiled without it by removing the dshape define from the makefile you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendorsupplied x  libraries  from john b melby melbyykfujitsucojpuunetuunet 000   when i run a x program that i wrote on a sunos 000 or 00 machine i get the  error ldso symbol not found xtinherit  what you are seeing is a sideeffect of a kludge in the r0 libxta to  get sun shared libraries working  apparently you cant share a function that  is both called and compared as xtinherit is this was handled by putting  xtinherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded  that is in initializec where  xttoolkitinitialize and xtinitialize reside these routines would normally be called  you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal xtbased program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize anywhere  0 it may be a program that uses xt functions but never opens a  connection to the x server  osfmotifs 000 uil had this problem it called xtmalloc and other xt functions the solution is to add the call to your  program the function does not have to be executed just linked in 0 alternatively your program doesnt need any xt functions and is correct in not calling xttoolkitinitialize  it may be an xlib or xview  program in this case you can remove lxt from your link command   it should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically although this will certainly solve the problem  from jordan hayes now jordanmoorenetcom and danny backx dbsunbimbe  0000   i have a program that worked well under x00r0 when i try to link it under  the current version of x i get this message undefined xtscrollbarsetthumb xttextsetinsertionpoint xttextreplace  there were several name changes in the athena widget set in addition to the header files moving into x00xaw these are mentioned in the r0 release notes in this case these functions are not really xt functions but are part of the xaw text widget and so have been renamed from xt to xaw 0000     the window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another  in order to get keystrokes your program must ask the window manager for the input focus  to do this you must set up what are called hints for the window manager  if your applications is xlibbased you can use something like the following          xwmhints wmhints                  wmhintsflags  inputhint         wmhintsinput  true         xsetwmhintsdpy window wmhints  if your application is based on the xt intrinsics you can set the xtninput  resource to be true as you probably want to in any case if you dont have source you can start up the application with the resource inputtrue  certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having  this done   if you are using suns openwindows olwm you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that arent icccmcompliant openwindowsfocuslenience       true  mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun    you cant reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case  for most cases you shouldnt care which window manager is running so  long as you do things in an icccmconformant manner there are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases alternatively it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific added features such as olwms pushpin menus in order to give your program added functionality beware of usurping the window  managers functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing this surely leads to future compatibility problems    there is no general framework such as the transskel program for the  macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development in x the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cutpaste on existing x applications good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just  this one little thing include contribclientsxskel a simple r0 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks the xaw examples in the examples directory in the r0 and r0  distributions and the xlib hello world example in the r0 dochelloworld and  r0 doctutorialshelloworld an updated version of this program which uses r0  xlib calls and current icccm conventions was posted in 000 to compwindowsx   by glenn widener of tektronix 000  in addition a sample xt program for xaw or xm by rainer klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on exportlcsmitedu in contribmdisptarz 000    the xtgetvalues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable your code may be doing something like this  arg args0 int i int sensitive oops wrong data type  i0 xtsetarg argsi xtnsensitive sensitive i xtgetvalueswidget args i     but xtnsensitive is a boolean which on most machines is a single byte  declaring the variable sensitive as boolean works properly this problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the xt types  dimension and position code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short in general you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource as it appears in the widgets man page 0000    youre probably trying to use these functions from application code they should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children other promising  functions xtmakegeometryrequest and xtmakeresizerequest are also for use  only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its parent the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an xtsetvalues call setting some of the geometry resources although this will result in the widgetinternal functions being called your application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the  widgets data becoming corrupted the xlib calls xmovewindow and xresizewindow should similarly be  avoided they shouldnt be used to change xtnx xtny xtnwidth or xtnheight    although there are various details of the current implementation of the xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the new widget should be resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves what should happen to the widgets children and by the time such semantics are defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old  widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired  resources as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in  creating a new widget  note that reparenting is possible in the oi toolkit

converseexpolcsmitedu    although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered  the specification does not guarantee such a sequence and supplemental  authoritative documents ie the asenteswick volume do say that the order is undefined  because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application xt cannot guarantee the order of execution in general the callback procedures should be thought of as operating  independently of one another and should not depend on sideeffects of other callbacks operating if a seqence is needed then the single callback to be  registered can explicitly call other functions necessary  000 thanks to converseexpolcsmitedu    xtdestroywidget operates in two passes in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures the functioncall marks the widget which is not  actually destroyed until your program returns to its eventloop     it is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback which has a clear flow of control the calls to askuser block until answer is set to one of the valid values if it is not a yes answer the code drops out of the callback and back to an eventprocessing loop   void quitwidget w xtpointer client xtpointer call  int             answer answer  askuserw really quit if retyes  answer  answer  askuserw are you really positive if retyes  answer exit0                    a more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether  to overwrite it this is accomplished by entering a second eventprocessing loop and waiting until the user answers the question the answer is returned to the calling function that function askuser looks something like this where the  motif can be

function you are calling is already executing it can leave the library in an inconsistent state note that the ansi c standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by  xlib or xt functions you can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added  note the article in the x journal 00 and the example in oreilly  volume 0 are in error  thanks to pete ware warecisohiostateedu and donna converse  converseexpolcsmitedu 000    you may see these errors if you issue xlib requests from an xlib error  handler or more likely if you make calls which generate x requests to xt or  xlib from a signal handler which you shouldnt be doing in any case     its very common to need to write an xt program that can accept input  both from a user via the x connection and from some other file descriptor but  which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the x connection or  the other file descriptor a solution is use xtappaddinput after you open your file descriptor use xtappaddinput to register an input handler the input handler will be  called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your  programs attention write the input handler like you would any other xt  callback so it does its work quickly and returns  it is important to use only nonblocking io system calls in your input handlers most input handlers read the file descriptor although you can have an  input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file you will find that the function is called even when there isnt input pending xtappaddinput is actually working as it is supposed to the input handler is  called whenever the file descriptor is ready to be read not only when there is new data to be read a disk file unlike a pipe or socket is almost always  ready to be read however if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data youve read before  the result is that your function will almost always be called every time around xtappmainloop there is a way to get the  type of interaction you are expecting add this line to the beginning of your  function to test whether there is new data      if ioctlfd fionread n  0  n  0 return but because this is called frequently your application is effectively in a  busywait you may be better off not using xtappaddinput and instead setting  a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input  courtesy dan heller argvoracom 000 mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu 000 ollie jones ojpictelcom 000    you can do this using xsendevent its likely that youre not setting the window field in the event which xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event  if youre sending events to your own application then you can use  xtdispatchevent instead this is more efficient than xsendevent in that you avoid a roundtrip to the server depending on how well the widget was written you may be able to call its action procedures in

single x display supports a  server can support several independent screens they are numbered unix00 unix00 unix00 etc the screen or screennumber is the second digit  the 0 0 0 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available  screens on this particular display connection the macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular screen on which your application is running typically have two forms  one which takes a screen and one with takes both the display and the screennumber in xtbased programs you typically use xtscreenwidget to determine  the screen on which your application is running if it uses a single screen part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the screen have display in the names

mit x consortium    a completely transparent window is easy to get  use an inputonly window in order to create a window which is mostly transparent you have several choices  the shape extension first released with x00r0 offers an easy way to make nonrectangular windows so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent however not all servers  support the extension  a machinespecific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware  note  that there is no x notion of a transparent color index  a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny  windows but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult  a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information if so you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly  thanks to der mouse mouselightningmcrcimmcgilledu 000 see also the x journal 00 for a more complete answer including code samples for this last option    when using gxxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black for example should produce white however the drawing operation does not work on rgb values but on colormap indices the color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself on many x servers black and white often 00 or 00 programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break if you want to be combining colors with gxxor then you should be  allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen precomputed values if you want to use gxxor simply to switch between two colors then you  can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the gc graphics  context to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over  red say the result is blue and when it draws over blue the result is red  this foreground value is itself the xor of the colormap indices of red and  blue  thanks to

mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu    the initial contents of pixmaps are undefined  this means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there   which is usually

pixmap as a  mask courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun   my program has the id of a window on a remote display i want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it  because x is asynchronous there isnt a guarantee that the window  would still exist between the time that you got the id and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it what you should do is send the event without checking but install an error handler to catch any badwindow  errors which would indicate that the window no longer exists this scheme will work except on the rare occasion that the original window has been destroyed  and its id reallocated to another window  courtesy ken lee kleesynopticscom 000    yes the x server assigns ids to windows and other resources actually the server assigns some bits the client others and any application that  knows the id can manipulate the resource almost any x server resource except for gcs and private color cells can be shared the problem you face is how to disseminate the window id to multiple  applications a simple way to handle this and which solves the problem of the applications running on different machines is in the first application to  create a speciallynamed property on the rootwindow and put the window id into it the second application then retrieves the property whose name it also knows and then can draw whatever it wants into the window note this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the question about using window ids on remote displays note also that you will still need to coordinate any higherlevel  cooperation among your applications  note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to  use the same server connection if one process is a child of the other it  should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection  mostly courtesy phil

visibilitynotify events so that it isnt overlapped   imagine the conflict between two such programs running   the only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window

mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu der mouse 000    users of xt have the support of the translation manager to help  get notification of doubleclicking there is no good way to get only a doubleclick in xlib because the  protocol does not provide enough support to do doubleclicks  you have to do  clientside timeouts unless the singleclick action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server  thus you  have to do timeouts which means systemdependent code  on most unixish  implementations you can use xconnectionnumber to get the file descriptor of  the x connection and then use select or something similar on that note that many userinterface references suggest that a doubleclick be used to extend the action indicated by a singleclick if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it too should be the singleclick action or the doubleclick action  thanks to mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu der mouse 000    xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics  capabilities leaving them up to serverextensions or clientsside graphics

       i am writing a program which needs to draw colour xpm pixmap files onto a background without having the borders show up i cannot do xor as the colours all stuff up i cannot use xcopyplane as that is for single planes only i want to be able to specify a colour in the pixmap to be used as the opaque colour is this possible     games such as xjewel have the same problem how does the mouse pointer do it    any help would be helpful     you wanna do masking build a bitmap pixmap of depth one where all pixels you name opaque are 0 that get copied and the others are 0 use this bitmap as the clipmask in the gc used for xcopyarea and remember to adjust the cliporigin coordinates to the xcopyarea blit origin  the mouse pointer besides from that it is driven using ramdac analog mapping on most hardwares uses a mask too  but be warned blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask is annoying slow on most xservers it flickers even at 00 mips   oo  o                   brain inside                         o   o                                                 o   o  andre beck abpsoft mehl andrebeckirsinftudresdende  o  oo  
    in article buzz00mar00000000lionbearcom buzzbearcom buzz moschetti  writes   this is a simple x graphics question      assume you have a valid window w an icon pixmap and the background   mask also a pixmap for that icon  you wish to place the icon at xy   in w without the background      question what combination of xcopyarea and gc functions are necessary   i think the idea is to merge only those pixels of pixmap into w as   indicated by the corresponding mask pixel value  specifically the   problem involves a pixmap and mask generated by the xpm libs      any clues would be most appreciated      xpm provides you with symbolic color names which can be specified at load time  so for doing what you want i would suggest you to define a background symbol  in your pixmap file which youll set to whatever color is used by the widget or  the window on which you want to put your pixmap   this would surely be the simplest and fastest way to do what you want    no as soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a little dislocation you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the icon first blitted because it draws a full rectangle the way to do it is masking create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 0 and all not to be merged are 0 then set the clipmask of the gc to this bitmap set the clipxorigin and clipyorigin of the gc to the xy coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable use gxcopy and xcopyarea the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc    oo  o                   brain inside                         o   o                                                 o   o  andre beck abpsoft mehl andrebeckirsinftudresdende  o  oo

is to provide the vendorneutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work membership in the  consortium open to any organization  there are two categories of membership  member for large organizations and affiliate for smaller organizations most of the consortiums activities take place via electronic mail  with meetings when required  as designs and specifications take shape interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations   typically a small multiorganization architecture team leads the design with  others acting as close observers and reviewers  once a complete specification is produced it may be submitted for formal technical review by the consortium as a proposed standard  the standards process typically includes public  review outside the consortium and a demonstration of proof of concept your involvement in the public review process or as a member or  affiliate of the consortium is welcomed write to bob scheifler

copyright sample implementation  source and documentation are available in the r0 release several vendors are currently selling independentlydeveloped pex servers for  their workstations and x terminals  last modified 0000    there are several options for using x over serial lines  slip  serial line ip this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending ip packets over pointtopoint serial links it has been around for several years and implementations are available for many of the major tcpip implementations most x terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow  the tcpip headers add 00 bytes per  packet and the tcpip encoding of the x protocol is rather verbose rightfully  so it is optimized for packing and unpacking over highspeed links   cslip  compressed header slip this is a variant of slip that compresses the  00 bytes of tcpip headers down to about 0 or 0 bytes  it still doesnt do  anything about reencoding the x protocol  modems that do compression can help but they increase packet latency it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces plus the compression assembly time  ppp  pointtopoint protocol this is an emerging standard for pointtopoint links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than slip  a growing number of people see the combination of ppp for the serial  line management and cslip for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal tcpip protocols over serial lines  running raw x over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable  xremote  this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by ncd for squeezing the x protocol over serial lines  in addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to pppcslip xremote removes  redundancies in the x protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using lzw to compress the entire data stream  this work is done by either a  pseudox server or proxy running on the host or in a terminal server  there  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem    0you dont have to have compressing modems in there if you wouldnt  otherwise be using them eg if you were going to be directly  connected and    0it reduces the io overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that have to cross the serial interface and    0in addition to the effects of 0 it reduces the latency in delivering  packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for  blocks to compress  lbx  low bandwidth x this is an x consortium project that is working on a standard for this area  it is being chaired by ncd and xerox and is using  ncds xremote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol  lbx will go beyond xremote by adding proxy caching of commonlyused information  eg connection setup data large window properties font metrics keymaps  etc and a more efficient encoding of the x protocol the hope is to have a  standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in r0  additional technical information about how xremote works and a few notes on how lbx might be different are available via anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu in contrib in the following files         xremoteslidesps

file your x  session runs only as long as the last job is running and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out instead run the window manager in the background and as the last job instead invoke something safe like exec xterm name login rv iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action your x session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager    although no known window manager directly supports such a feature  which may be equivalent to writing out a xinitrc or xsession file naming the geometry and wmcommand of each application but olvwm may have something  close  there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for although it is not as

whereverusrbinx00yourfavoritewm    you can turn autorepeat on or off by using xset r onoff the x protocol however doesnt provide for varying the autorepeat rate which is a capability not supported by all systems some servers running on systems that support this however may provide commandline flags to set the rate at startup time if you have control over  server startup see the man pages for xinit and xdm you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings for example you can start the xsun server  from mit with the options ar0 000 ar0 00 to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard    there is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key the xmodmap client which is useful  for moving your ctrl and esc keys to useful places just rearranges keys and  does not do macro expansion some few clients including xterm and several xbased editors  accept a translation resource such as xtermvt000translations override  keyf0 stringsetenv display unix0 which permits the shorthand f0 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm it takes effect for new xterm clients to include control characters in the string use nnn where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include window managers which could provide this facility do not yet nor has a special remapper client been made available    david b lewis

program which produces a sun raster file some x terminals  have local screendump utilities to write postscript to a local serial printer  some vendors implementations of lpr eg sony include direct  support for printing xwd files but youll typically need some other package  to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer    if you need color postscript in particular you can   grab the screenimage using a program which can produce color  postscript such as xgrabsc and xv   grab the screenimage using xwd and postprocess xwd into color ps you can do this using

material from larry carroll larrycpoejplnasagov 000    the solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar a solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell echo esc0textg where esc is the escape key text is the string you wish to have displayed and g is a controlg the bel character  here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories alias newcd cd  echo n esc0cwdg  the digit 0 in these strings indicates to xterm that it should  change only the title of the window to change both the title and the name  used in the icon use the digit 0 instead and use 0 to change only the  icon name  note another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified cd is used in a subshell is to wrap the escape sequences into the ps0 prompt itself  note on an ibm rs0000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a v    the best source of such information is in your r0 sources in the file  ctlseqsms a postscript version is in mithardcopyclientsctlseqspsz  oreillys volume 0 the x users guide includes an r0 version of the control  sequences the standard volume will be available 000 and a motif version of  the book is available now the current r0 guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences 000  other good sources of information include the r0 version of that document and also the file in the r0 sources called mitclientsxtermctlseq0txt a  compilation put together by skip montanaro ge crd listing the vt000  sequences it dates from r0 but is fairly accurate  a hardcopy version was  published in the december 0000 xnextevent the xug newsletter  in a pinch a vt000 manual will do  last updated 0000     in order to use special characters such as the oumlaut you need to  stty pass0 but also to use a charcell iso0000 font such as  xtermfont mediumrnormal000ciso00000 xtermboldfontboldrnormal000ciso00000 the family is intentionally unspecified in this example  in addition you may want to set this in your shell setenv lcctype iso00000          for a given character above 000 you can determine the key to use with  the alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 000 try using man ascii for example oumlaut v is altv and the section character   is alt   thanks to greg holmberg gregthirdiuunetuunet and stephen gildea  gildeaexpolcsmitedu 000    you are probably setting the geometry small accidentally if you give  a resource specification like this xtermgeometry 00x00 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 00x00 for the main window this is ok as it uses characters for its size  but its popup menus dont they are in pixels and show up small to set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly xtermvt000geometry 00x00    you could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command  however a program by richard hesketh rlh0ukcacuk specifically for  manipulating the selection will help eg   xselection primary  lpr finds the primary selection and prints it this command can be placed in a  windowmanager menu or in shellscripts xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties a version is on export also available is riaccsuwocapubxgetselectiontarz which can be adapted to do this    you can use several environment variables to control how resources are  loaded for your xtbased programs  xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and  xapplresdir  these environment variables control where xt looks for  applicationdefaults files as an application is initializing  xt loads at most one appdefaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath  set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a  way that appdefaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies suppose for example that you are running suns open windows and you also  have some r0 x applications installed in usrlibx00appdefaults you could  set a value like this for xfilesearchpath and it would cause xt to look up  appdefaults files in both usrlibx00 and usropenwinlib or wherever your openwinhome is located setenv xfilesearchpath usrlibx00tnopenwinhomelibtn  the value of this environment variable is a colonseparated list of pathnames  the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see  xtresolvepathname          n      the value of the filename parameter or the                 applications class name         t      the value of the file type  in this case the                 literal string appdefaults         c      customization resource r0 only         s      suffix  none for appdefaults         l      language locale and codeset eg jajpeuc         l      language part of l  eg ja         t      the territory part of the displays language string         c      the codeset part of the displays language string  lets take apart the example  suppose the applications class name is  myterm also suppose open windows is installed in usropenwin notice the  example omits localespecific lookup usrlibx00tn        means usrlibx00appdefaultsmyterm openwinhomelibtn    means usropenwinlibappdefaultsmyterm  as the application initializes xt tries to open both of the above  appdefaults files in the order shown  as soon as it finds one it reads it  and uses it and stops looking for others  the effect of this path is to  search first in usrlibx00 then in usropenwin  lets consider another example this time lets set  xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file mytermad in the current working  directory then for myterm in the directory appdefaults setenv xuserfilesearchpath nadhomeappdefaultsn  the first path in the list expands to mytermad  the second expands  to homeappdefaultsmyterm  this is a convenient setting for debugging  because it follows the imake convention of naming the appdefaults file  mytermad in the applications source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly  note when looking for appdefault files with xuserfilesearchpath for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so t and s are useless  with r0 theres another twist  you may specify a customization  resource value  for example you might run the myterm application like this myterm xrm customization color  if one of your pathname specifications had the value usrlibx00tnc then the expanded pathname would be usrlibx00appdefaultsmytermcolor because the c substitution character  takes on the value of the customization resource  the default xfilesearchpath compiled into xt is usrlibx00ltnc  r0 usrlibx00ltnc  r0 usrlibx00tnc     r0 usrlibx00ltn usrlibx00ltn usrlibx00tn  note some sites replace usrlibx00 with a projectroot in this batch of default settings  the default xuserfilesearchpath also compiled into xt is  rootlnc  r0 rootlnc  r0 rootnc     r0 rootln rootln rootn  root is either the value of xapplresdir or the users home directory  if xapplresdir is not set  if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other  than the default xt ignores xapplresdir altogether  notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find  your appdefaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir  to  a single dot  in r0 all this machinery worked differently for r0  compatibilty many people set their xapplresdir value to  a dot followed  by a slash  thanks to oliver jones ojworldstdcom 000    the answer lies in changing xdms xrdb resource in the xdmconfig file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources for example  your usrlibx00xdmxdmconfig file may add the line  displaymanager0authorize false  to permit unrestricted access to the display before login beware and also  displaymanagerxrdbusrlibx00xdmnewxrdb where that file does something for all connections along the lines of binsh comes in with arguments display 0 load usrlibx00xdmxresources usrbinx00xsetroot display 0 bitmap usrlibx00xdmnewbitmap usrbinx00xrdb  substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to taste  note that this is a  general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client  thanks to jay bourland jaybcauchystanfordedu 000    when xdm runs your xsession it doesnt source your cshrc or login files you can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any sh script or you can place all environmentsetting statements in a separate file and source it from both the xsession file and your shell configuration file or if you set your path in your cshrc file the normal place you can make your  xsession have path set simply by making it a csh script ie by starting your xsession file off with bincsh  if this doesnt work also try starting off with binsh  reset path pathcsh c echo path  export path    there are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv display  whenever you log in to another networked unix machine running x one solution is to use the clientsxrsh on the r0 contrib tape  it  includes xrsh a script to start an x application on remote machine and xrlogin a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine a more recent version is on export in xrsh00shar one solution is to use the xrlogin program from der mouse mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu you can ftp caveatemptor versions from 00000000 in xxrloginc and xxrlogindc the program packages up term and display into a single string which is stuffed into term  rlogin then  propagates term normally your cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval xrlogind where xrlogind is a program that checks term and if it is of the special  format it recognizes unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to  recreate the environment variables 0000  in addition if all you need to do is start a remote x process on  another host and you find rsh host n usrbinx00xterm display display  too simple display must have your real hostname then this version of xrsh  can be used to start up remote x processes the equivalent usage would be  xrsh host xterm     binsh    start an x00 process on another host    date 0 dec 00 000000 gmt    from chris torek chrismimsyumdedu    rsh host n setenv display display exec  devnull devnull       an improved version    rxcmd suggested by john robinson jrbbncom          generalized for shksh by keith boyer keithcisohiostateedu       but they put the rcmd in s which left zombies again  this    script combines the best

postprocessed with pbmplus to design the individual  characters and then to do some large amount of postprocessing to concatenate  them into the bdf format see ollie joness article in the november 00 x  journal for more information the r0 contrib area in fontsutils and in clientsxtroff contained  a number of useful utilities including some to convert between bdf font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor an easier way is to use the xfed client to modify an existing font a version is on the r0 or r0 x00r0 contrib tape in contribclientsxfed xfed is  available for anonymous ftp on ftpinformatikunidortmundde 0000000000  possibly as file pubwindowsxdiversex00sourcenxfedtarz it can produce bdfformat fonts which can be compiled for a variety of x servers the xfedor client from group bull permits creation of bitmaps cursors xpm0 pixmaps and fonts binaries for common machines are on avahiinriafr in pub in addition the sources an old xlib implementation have been placed  000 in exportcontrib  if you are a metafont user you can use mftobdf from the seetex distribution to convert pk gf and pxl fonts to bdf format the distribution is on ftpcscoloradoedu and on exportlcsmitedu the gnu package fontutils00tarz on prepaimitedu includes xbfe a font editor and a number of utilities for massaging font formats the oreilly x resource issue 0 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font fonts can be resized with hiroto kagotanis bdfresize a new version is in ftpcstitechacjpx00contrib    after you have built the font using your systems fontcompiler  installed it in some directory and run mkfontdir or your systems equivalent eg bldfamily for openwindows in that directory be sure to use xset fp  dir to add that full pathname to the servers fontpath or if the  directory is already in the path use xset fp rehash so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found it is this last step that youre probably  leaving out you can also use xset q to make sure that that directory is in  the path sometimes your xset fp dir command fails with a badvalue error x error of failed requestbadvalue integer parameter out of range for operation major opcode of failed request  00 xsetfontpath  this means the x server cannot find or read your font directory or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server  the mention of an integer parameter in the message is spurious   is the font directory youre specifying readable from the servers file    system  remember its the server not the client which interprets your    font directory  trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an    xset command with shell metacharacters in it eg xset fp myfonts and    the server is an x terminal or managed by xdm   is the directory really a font directory  if youre running an mit server    or most varieties of vendor servers look in the directory for the file    fontsdir  if you cant find that file run mkfontdir0  if youre    running openwindows look for the file familieslist  if you cant find    it run bldfamily0   if youre in a site where some people run x00rn servers and others run a    proprietary server with nonstandard font formats openwindows for    example make sure the font directory is right for the server youre using    hint if the directory contains pcf andor snf files it wont work for    open windows  if the directory contains ff andor fb files it wont work    for x00rn  thanks to der mouse mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu and to oliver jones  ojpictelcom 000     a tool called snftobdf 00 is part of the bdftools package which is  available from exportlcsmiteducontribbdftoolstarz and from  crlnmsuedupubmiscbdftoolstarz  000    der mouses getbdf is one solution it connects to a server and  produces a bdf file for any font the server is willing to let it  it can be  used as an anythingtobdf converter but requires access to a server that can  understand the font file thus is both more and less powerful than other tools  such as snftobdf getbdf is on 00000000 in xgetbdfc or available via mail  from mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu 000 in addition the r0 program fstobdf can produce bdf for any font that the r0 server has access to    the decwindows fonts typically dont exist on a nondec installation but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by decwindows applications to standard mit fonts of similar characteristics and size pick up the file  contribdecwindowsonx00r0fontaliases from exportlcsmitedu this file is  for a standard mit r0 server  it can also serve as a starting point for  creating a similar aliases file for the open windows server or other servers  which do not use the mit font scheme    the format of fonts preferred by decs x server is the pcf format you can produce this compiled format from the bdf format by using decs dxfc fontcompiler note that the dec servers can also use raw bdf fonts with a performance hit   i want to be able to do something like this xclockbackgroundpixmap      usrincludex00bitmapsrootweave  you cant do this the backgroundpixmap resource is a pixmap of the  same depth as the screen not a bitmap which is a pixmap of depth 0 because  of this writing a generic string to pixmap converter is impossible since  there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps therefore  neither the x toolkit or the athena widget set define a string to pixmap  converter because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a  resource  the athena widget set does define a string to bitmap converter for  use in many of its widgets however courtesy chris d peterson now kiticscom 000  however a specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of  the xloadimage package by jim frost was posted 0000 by sebastian wangnick  bastiunidoinformatikunidortmundde it permits loading of a number of  image formats as a pixmap  the leading generalpurpose format for pixmaps is the xpm format used  by groupe bull in several of its programs including the gwm window manager by att in its olpixmap editor and by ics in its interface builder xpm  distribution available on export as contribxpmtarz includes readwrite  routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner  see information on the xpmtalk mailing list above xpm 00f was announced in 000 and is available from exportlcsmitedu and avahiinriafr an older version is on  the r0 contrib tape a set of xpm icons collected by anthony thyssen  anthonykurangocitgueduau is on export in contribaicons    you probably have an extra space after the specification of the first  item like this basictexttranslations  override  ctrlkeya    beginningofline n  ctrlkeye    endofline        extra space the newline after that space is ending the translation definition thanks to timothy j horton 000    one solution is xchron in volume 0 of compsourcesx which can show the time for timezones other than the local one  alternatively you can probably set the timezone in the shell from which you invoke the xclock or oclock or use a script similar to this binsh tzpst0pdt xclock name sanluisobispoca 0 devnull  tzest0edt xclock name kingofprussiapa 0 devnull     the xmh mailreader requires the rand mh mailmessage handling system which is

  archivename xfaqpart0 lastmodified 00000000    the release of new public patches by the mit x consortium is announced in the compwindowsxannounce newsgroup  patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which x00 is available they are now also distributed through the  newsgroup compsourcesx some source resellers may be including patches in  their source distributions of x00  people without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server it now has  00 patches for x00r0 000  send to xstuffexpolcsmitedu the subject line send fixes  where  is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch  here are a few complications 0 fix 0 is in four parts you need to request 0a 0b 0c and  0d separately 0 the file sungxuu which was part of an earlier patch was  rereleased with patch 0 note the file doesnt work with solaris 0 fix 0 is in two parts 0a and 0b 0 fix 00 is in three parts 00a 00b and 00c 0 fix 00 is in two parts 00a and 00b 0 fix 00 replaces the r0fixtest0 for the x test suite which  previously was optional 0 fix 00 also needs pexlibtarz which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for pexlibuu0000 0 fix 00 is in 0 parts 00a through 00i    the xstuff server is a mailresponse program that means that you mail  it a request and it mails back the response any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line the xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can  have several different commands in a single message unless you ask for help  the xstuff server treats the subject header line just like any other line  of the message the archives are organized into a series of directories and  subdirectories  each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an  index the toplevel index gives you an overview of what is in the  subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it  0 the command help or send help causes the server to send you a  more detailed version of this help file 0 if your message contains a line whose first word is index then  the server will send you the toplevel index of the contents of the archive if there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then  the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the toplevel index  for example you can say send index fixes or index fixes a message that  requests an index cannot request data 0 if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the xstuff server will send you the items named on the rest of the line to name  an item you give its directory and its name for example                 send fixes 0 0 0a 0b 0 you may issue multiple send requests the xstuff server contains many  safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large  amounts of data the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day if the work queue contains more requests than the  days quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day  whenever the mailer is run to send its days quota it sends the requests out  shortestfirst 0 some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting  return addresses  if you use such a mailer you wont get any response  if  you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like         path foobarbitnetmitvmamitedu or         path barfoofrotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use it  the xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuffexpolcsmitedu if  your mailer deals in  notation try sending to

  epsteintrwacsfptrwcom jeremy epstein writes  dmmheadcfaharvardedu david meleedy writes theres a bug in sunos 000 which is alluded to in the faq although there its talking about x00r0 as being affected  you need to force libxmu to be linked statically rather than dynamically which works around the linker error  the simplest thing to do is edit each of the makefiles where theres a failure and change the line which reads xmulib  lxmusrc lxmu to xmulib  lxmusrc bstatic lxmu bdynamic  no this is only relevant for openwindows 0x as shipped with sunos it is not relevant for mit r0 mit r0

and other useful material not found on previous disks  the sug 00000 disk which was assembled by robert a bruce contains a lot of essential source code and we decided it would be a great service to

   hi  i am trying to implement a pointer feature in xlib  i have multiple windows and all can take input and  show output simultaneously on all other displays  i want to implement a pointer feature   i would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once  i choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able to see it  can you give me some hints as to how i should proceed  i am new to xlib    replies will be greatly appreciated  thank you  prakash  duvvuricsoduedu    
  what i want to be able to do is to set the cursor color to the same as the forground color that is set for that xterm  from the man page  cr color  this option specifies the color to use for text cur  sor   the  default  is  to  use the same foreground    color that is used for text    however this doesnt seem to be the case it appears to default to black or to whatever xtermcursorcolor is set to  feel free to point me at the relevant fm or whatever cheers c

  im writing xwall a simple x version of wall and i want it to put a message up on each of a default list of displays  the problem is that xopendisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently controlled by xdm login screen   xdm does xgrabserver when its running in secure mode so do some screenlocks  theres really no simple way to tell this is the case  you can take xdm out of secure mode  probably not too cool  you can wrap your call to xopendisplay in some code which solicts a future sigalrm and longjmps past the xopendisplay from the signal handler  an example of this can be seen in the xdm sources  note that longjmping out of xopendisplay probably causes a memory leak  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit  regularly  
       im doing a study on what the following type of users would like to   have on a unix manager  basically im looking for the unix commands   and features on motif window interface which will help the different   type of users make use of unix      personally i cant stand motif  i also cant stand gui      command line  interfaces for things like access to the commands i know      command line  and love  i think youll find that experience sic users    command line    der mouse     a year and a half ago i felt the same way  the i started using gooyies  give me the command line when something out of the ordinary needs done and the gooy when i am doing normal or repative work  note that most operations are repetative  hackers love cls because     what i like about guis   the ability to view and manipulate a group of objects files   text directories etc and and manipulate them in some way   such as delete copy paste rename    the ability to have several applications  screens visible   and accessable at the same time   being able to do a standard set of functions easily and   quickly on an unfamiliar operating system i am familiar with   the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally   i will have to some work on a system that i almost never use   if it has a gui i can usually accomplish what i want to do   fairly easily the command line on the other hand often is   a long and painful experience   what i hate about guis   having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard i guess   i have a strong onehanded preference i like to use a   computer with one hand and use the other for holding something   like a piece of paper of a mug of tea i have configured my   favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be   done with one hand such as navigating cutting pasting   searching opening and saving files etc the main thing i   need to use both hands for is entering text  i guess i need to get one of those mice with like 00 buttons or something and then i will have the best of both worlds  brent

  can anyone recomend a good book or article on interclient communications besides iccm  ive looked everywhere i can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it but nobody shows you how  oreilly has no examples iccm has no examples asente  swick give no examples  in fact most of the books ive looked at if they discuss icc at all simply give a condensed version of the iccm and then refer you to the iccm  i did find one example of how to use atoms and  properties in youngs book and five hours after i bought youngs book i had my applications talking to each other  i am not sure however if thats the best way  id like to stay independent  of unix so pipes andor sockets probably arent the way to go  but within x one can also use messages the clipboard and perhaps window groups  i need a text that discusses the various methods discusses which method is best for which purpose and gives examples  without examples its all just words  thanks in advance  ross  
  well i am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask but let me try anyway i am running xterm and like all unix users i run man something recently i switched to solaris 00 and their man pages are littered with i directives that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm the resulting output admittedly a personal taste is very annoying to look at back when i was using sunos 000 i remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with underlining  so my question is how do i change the xterms behaviour under i directives  for nroff man pages to perhaps underlining or at least disabling it b  directives are fine i like them and of course i dont want to go in and edit the man pages inputs somehow xterm allows one to specify both a normal font and a bold font but not an italic font  any pointers suggestions are greatly appreciated thanks  john  ps running xterm rv wont work i tried

concerned with x  there are of course   many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation   however they are outside the scope of this document       people seriously interested in

faq     david b lewis faqcraftuunetuunet maintains the informative and   well written compwindowsx frequently asked questions document   its focus is on general x information while this faq

can try to soup up your window manger   is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move   also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   windows                           joe english joetrysteroartcom    ive found that a good font for tiling is 0x00 aka   miscfixedmediumrnormal00000000000c00iso00000  it is   the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun 0000x000 screen   and still get two 00 column terminal windows sidebyside on the   display with no overlap  other font suggestions will be accepted   the x server   which server          make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware   if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x00 server    on my monochrome sun i havent noticed much difference between   the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it was pointed out to   me that xsunmono is about 000k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging             thanks to jonny farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk                         michael salmon michaelsalmoneosericssonse     how your server was compiled can also make a difference  jeff law   lawschirfcsutahedu advises us that on a sun system x should be   compiled with gcc version 0 or with the unbundled sun compiler   you can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not   using the bundled sunos compiler  i assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other highquality commercial   compilers on the market  locking the server into ram                  has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and   does not get paged  eg via a call to plock  does this help   performance at all  ive had one inquiry on this topic and a few   pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone   whos tried it  i am not in a position to give it a try     thanks to eric c claeys eccepermattcom       danny backx dbsunbimbe       juan d martin juandocnmuses  starting your server              joe english joetrysteroartcom      if you start up a lot of clients in your xsession or whatever sleep     for a second or two after launching each one  after i changed my     xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time     we have a heavily loaded system without much core though    this sounds crazy but i have confirmed that it works      warner losh impsolbournecom provided me with a good explanation of   why this works which i have summarized here      when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections  a lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts  this process touches a large number of     pages  any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory  if you     put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up      similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x     client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources     being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so     forth  all this activity is typically memory intensive  once this     initialization is done the process has reached a steady state     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages     by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstations limited resources    this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation as there   are so many variables to be considered available ram local swap   space load average number of users on your system which clients   you are starting etc    currently in my xinitrc i have a situation like sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm      ive experimented with sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm      ive even tried sleep 0 exec startxclientsscript     and then in startxclientsscript i had sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm         the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my xinitrc and had settled down     into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched     all of these yielded fairly comparable results and so i just stuck with   my current setup for its simplicity  you will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you  fonts      loading fonts takes time and ram  if you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use youll get speed increases in loadup time    one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one   large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients  or   at least all your heavily used clients  to use only those few fonts   client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server  this will also conserve server resources since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server        farrell mckay fbmptcburpptcbuozau         joe english joetrysteroartcom     eg my main xterm font is 0x00 so i also have twm set up to use 0x00   in all its menus and icons etc  twms default font is 0x00  since   i dont normally use 0x00 ive eliminated one font from my server    oliver jones ojroadrunnerpictelcom     keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs     if you will make extensive use of r0 scalable fonts use a font server  about the resources file                   keep your xresources  xdefaults file small  saves ram and saves     on server startup time          joe english joetrysteroartcom    one suggestion      in your xdefaults xresources file try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications  for example  reversevideo true      then separate your resources into individual clientspecific     resource files  for example homelibappdefaults  in your     login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath  setenv xuserfilesearchpath homelibappdefaultsn       the compwindowsx frequently asked questions faq contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work     ed      so when xterm launches it loads its resources from     appdefaultsxterm  xdvi finds them in appdefaultsxdvi     and so on and so forth  note that not all clients follow the same     xxxxx resourcefile naming pattern  you can check in your system     appdefaults directory often usrx00r0libx00appdefaults to     find the proper name and then name your personal resource files     with the same name      this is all documented in the xt specification pg 000  000     thanks to kevin samborn sambornmtkgccom          michael urban urbancobrajplnasagov              and mike long mikeleecornelledu      kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers    this method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits       easier to maintain  more usable       fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resourcemanager       property  as a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker since it doesnt have to load all your resources       applications only process their own resources never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them    it also has drawbacks       the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up  this doesnt seem to       make that much of a performance difference and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability  if you are modifying an       applications resource database you just need to rerun the       application without having to xrdb again       xrdb will by default run your xdefaults file through cpp  when       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs they will not       watch out for this        i had c style comments in my xdefaults file which cpp stripped       out  when i switched to this method of distributed resource       files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources  xt did not       provide any error message when it encountered the c style       comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted       processing the resource file        the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy eg ifdef       color  is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management       you may also run into some clients which break the rules  for       example neither emacs 00000 nor xvt 00 will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in xdefaults       when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored your client       will not find its resources  loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources            casey leedom caseygaussllnlgov    a possible compromise suggestion that i have and am planning on trying   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my   xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for   clients that i seldom use  define your display properly                   client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server  in   that situation rather than setting your display environment variable to    hostname00 where hostname is the name of your workstation you   should set your display variable to unix00 or 00  by doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests thanks to patrick j horgan pjh00rasamdahlcom    see the display names section of the x0 man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name    i dont think its stock mit but at least data general and hp have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the display isnt set specially       rob sartin 00opensisartinuunetuunet    jody goldberg jodyalgorithmicscom sent me an xlib patch to change   stock r0 to use local communication even if display is not properly set   i dont want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   nonmit patches and so have elected not to include it here  hopefully mit   will apply this minor 0 lines patch themselves  in the meantime if   you want to try it yourself email jody  ed   clients     if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running  think also   about the kind of programs you are running  for example  is there   a smaller clock program than xclock    unfortunately i havent really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word     suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   eg xclock xterm xbiff are welcome  ed    ive received some contradictory advice from people on the subject   of x client programs  some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly xlib based since xt xaw and other toolkits are rather   large  others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries  in   this case using a nonxt for example client program may actually   increase the amount of ram consumed    the upshot of all this seems to be dont mix toolkits  that is try   and use just athena clients or just xview clients or just motif   clients etc  if you use more than one then youre dragging in   more than one toolkit library    know your environment and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment

ugly maybe but at my site its still the most used  i suspect that   xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites   laziness  isnt there a better terminal emulator available  see

suggested by richard hesketh rlh0ukcacuk     available exportlcsmitedu in contribxvt00tarz     if you dont need all the esoteric features of xterm then get    hold of xvt   it was written here just to save swap space as    xterm is rather a hog      this was written as a partial clone of xterm  you dont have to    rename your resources as xvt pretends to be xterm  in its current    version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm  ive heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature but ive not found any    yet     update march 0000  i recently had a few email conversations with    brian warkentin brianwarkentineengsuncom regarding xvt  he    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm  for    instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling    speed try this quickie benchmark bintime dd ifetctermcap    bs00 and see which program can scroll faster  also while xterm    may be slightly larger in ram requirements we dont have any hard    numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterms paging requirements are not that major     as an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it    made little difference since if you never use it it never gets    brought into memory     so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm  in summary  caveat emptor your mileage may vary    if you can provide some hard data id like to see it    specifically how much ram each occupies how much swap each needs    relative speed of each  0 mterm    suggested

people like it anyway   tuning your client              suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster    from scott barman scottasdcom comes a suggestion regarding motif   text field widgets      i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets i     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes     particularly the initial one in the field  examining the what was     going on with xscope i found it  it seems that when the resource     xmnblinkrate is nonzero and the focus is on a text field widget     or even just a text widget the ibeam cursor will blink     every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the     widget code is making a request to the server copyarea  the user     can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to 0  it is not     noticeable on a 00mhz sparc but it does make a little difference     on a slower system    this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas  consider your heavily used clients are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server   requests   miscellaneous suggestions   pretty pictures           dont use large bitmaps gifs etc as root window backgrounds     the more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc     these take up ram and cpu power  i work on a sun sparc and im     conscious of performance issues i cant comprehend it when i see     people with a 0mb sun 000 running xphoon as their root window      ill let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation     if youre anything like me you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway         thanks to qiang alex zhao azhaocsarizonaedu  for reminding me of this one ed  a quicker mouse           using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse  i use xset m 0 00 in my xinitrc file   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist  see the xset man page for further ideas and information    hint sometimes you may want to slow down your mouse tracking for   fine work  to cover my options i have placed a number of different   mouse

things you can do  some that stick out       for motif programs dont set xmfontlist resources for individual       buttons labels lists et al use the defaultfontlist or       labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highestlevel manager       widget  again stick to as few fonts as possible       better yet dont use motif at all  its an absolute pig       dont create and destroy widgets on the fly  try to reuse them       this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too       use a line width of 0 in gcs  on some servers this makes a huge       difference       compress and collapse multiple expose events  this can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one    francois staes franskiwiuiaacbe      just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily they suggested trying     out the gnuy malloc but i didnt find the time yet i did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the     differences were indeed very noticeable  somewhat 0 times faster     any confirmation on this from anyone  ed    andre beck andrebeckirsinftudresdende      unnecessary noexpose events      most people use xcopyareaxcopyplane as fastest blit routines but     they forget to reset graphicsexposures in the gc used for the     blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most     cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through its eventloop again and again     thousands of xchangegc requests      this gfx context switching is also seen in most handcoded xapps     where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed     again and again  xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching     and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters this will     remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the     connection by moving it toward the client startup phase  say what          some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first    david b lewis by day dblosforg by night davidcraftuunetuunet      how about this swap displays with someone else run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display goal reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server    im not in a situation where i can easily try this but i have received   the following confirmation    michael salmon michaelsalmoneosericssonse     i

your server when you run it on the same machine  not really a     major problem except that the x00 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing    timothy h panton thpwesthawkuucp      firstly it relies on the fact that most cpus are mostly idle xs     cpu usage is bursty  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpuintensive at the same time is small if they     are not then you get twice the cpumemory available for your     action      the second factor is that context switches are expensive using 0     cpus halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network typically 00k vs 0k for a pipe allowing     even fewer context

  hello     when starting bx if you recieve an error message saying cannot load appdefaults file check your xapplresdir environment variable and then put the file builderxcessory   this is the appdefaults file for bx  in the directory specified by the xuserfilesearchpath environment variable     if you dont have an xuserfilesearchpath environment variable then set xuserfilesearchpath to be the directory where the builderxcessory file is you can do this using the setenv command under csh note that the name ends in ad so you will have to set xuserfilesearchpath to bxnad to get the appdefaults to load correctly     to make sure the the appdefaults file can be read by all the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the appdefaults file exists in usrlibx00appdefaults or  usropenwinlibappdefaults depending on how your system is set up     once you have taken care of this set the systemdirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed bx  for example lets say ive installed bx in t then my system directory resource should be set like this   systemdirectory tbuilderxcessory      thanks       ics tech support

       let me point out that both guibased wordprocessors and textbased    formatters both have a language one happens to be mouse and    actionbased and the other symbolbased  true but thats beside the point this is a fact about an abstract model of what the gui users are doing not about what they actually are doing this abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a programmer of the system nb some users may see it too but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer  im not saying that the programmers perspective is evil or stunted after all thats what i do too i am saying that ui designers must carefully distinguish between the userprogrammer conceptual models and they must ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system       i dont recall the actual stats but something like 0 in 0 people can be    categorized as a symbol manipulator  it would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim at any rate i dont think this is evidence that 00 of users think like programmers bankers financial analysts structural engineers  these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation but what they do is not programming and programming is not required to do what they do   to restate my previous point yes users want to build their own solutions no they do not want to do programming to accomplish this

   i am reposting this because i am not sure my first post ever made it out  i have built and installed x00r0 on my sparcstation 0  my aim is to run  the mit x server but retain the openlook window manager  i am sure this  is not uncommon but i just want to make sure that i change andor delete  everything that i need to  for instance i can start xdm in rclocal but  how do i get rid of xnews      the openlook window manager source is available on the mit contrib tapes   or from  exportlcsmitedu  i would suggest building this too rather than   using the version from openwindows it is  olwm  v0  regards  richard gooch  
  i am creating a graphics program using the athena widgets i use xlib routines to install a custom graphics contex by obtaining the display and window variables with the xtwindowofobject and xtdisplayofobject the object was one of the sub widgets     the problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one i tried moving the allocation of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing changed i am preforming all of this manipulation before calling  xtappmainloop  thank you for any help leslie donaldson  donaldlfcsrosehulmanedu donaldlfnextworkrosehulmanedu  
  i am trying to figure out the current c toolkit directions more simply id like to know which c toolkit to bet on  for use in a new long term project  i have the same problem  i have looked at motif wwl interviews gina and a few variations on the above  ive also done a cursory examination of rogue waves viewh  i like viewhs abstractions best of all of the toolkits i mentioned but the resulting code looks little like motif and i have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code  gina allows you to write code which looks a great deal like motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance but the resulting code is almost too motiflike and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent c code  interviews looks promising but i havent found a free version with motif support and im not confident how widely interviews with motif support will be adopted and what if any specific motif support will be available over time  the other libraries produce code which is less motiflike but which does not make sufficient use of the features of c to simplify my coding task  at this point my inclination is to write my motif manipulation routines in c and invoke those routines from my c code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task  later if osf or some credible standardssetting body comes up with a c interface to motif i will change to that  it does me no goo to write in c if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions  its better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now  viewsh is the only library id consider right now but in our environment wed end up spending nearly 0000 to use it and i cant justify it when its likely to cause shortterm productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is unlikely to be a sufficiently longlived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the j curve   brad   brad daniels  if money cant buy happiness danielsneosoftcom   i guess ill have to rent it i dont work for neosoft and weird al yenkovic dont speak for my employer  
  ive been hearing rumblings about fresco and it sounds like it may be what im looking for but how far is it from release or at least some kind of availability  how similar is it to interviews  if i code to interviews will my code work with fresco  how about motif  ive heard some mention of versions of interviews which support motif  will it be feasible to use motif with fresco  any information would be much appreciated   brad   brad daniels  if money cant buy happiness danielsneosoftcom   i guess ill have to rent it i dont work for neosoft and weird al yenkovic dont speak for my employer

  berryduriancitruqozau andrew berry writes  my impression is that most people use motif because their os vendor supplies it with x sunos users excluded and because it is similar in look and feel to mswindows and os0 pm  personally i also prefer the look and feel of motif no flames please  just an opinion  seeing as motif has been adopted by sun ibm hp  cant remeber the other members in the recent announcement im sure youll see it on virtually every workstation ie sun ibm hp and dec must make up the vast majority of all hardware   i am also concerned by this prevalence of motif particularly from the point of view of writing and obtaining free software  as the linux and 000bsd communities grow however i think that motif will lose some of its grip at least in the noncommercial marketplace     ports of motif to both 000bsd and linux are available for a fee of about 000  this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to redistribute  the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups pertaining to motif has been high   i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial and noncommercial software ie you will only get free software using athena or openlook widget sets and only get commercial software using the motif widget sets     i cant see why  if just about every workstation will come with motif by default and you can buy it for under 000 for the free unix platforms i cant see this causing major problems   side note   all the x based code i am writing and will distribute freely when completed is based on motif because from a programmatic and also look and feel point of view i like it the best no flames on this one please    bambi                                      david j hughes     bambibuozau                                                                senior network programmer                              comms development  operation                     australia  00 00 000000

  hello motif world  a few days ago i posted my announcement for an update of motif i got several requests to send the bindings per email and i know of several people who have been using motif and there are probably a number of people i am not aware of who are also using motif  my question is  how many people out there would be interested to join a mailinglist where people can ask questions about motif swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings this would benefit the usercommunity as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to motif motif is still very much a voluntary project and this way i can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed  if youre interested in joining such a mailinglist please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so when there is sufficient interest say about 00 people or more a mailinglist will be set up at my site and i will post the announcement of the newlycreated list to this and other newsgroups   ronald van loon      in theory there is no difference  rvlooncvruunl   between theory and practice 0dcv group utrecht     the netherlands      in practice however there is

     i am also concerned by this prevalence of motif particularly from the  point of view of writing and obtaining free software  as the linux and  000bsd communities grow however i think that motif will lose some of  its grip at least in the noncommercial marketplace      ports of motif to both 000bsd and linux are available for a fee of about  000  this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to  redistribute  the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups  pertaining to motif has been high    i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial  and noncommercial software ie you will only get free software using  athena or openlook widget sets and only get commercial software using  the motif widget sets      i cant see why  if just about every workstation will come with motif  by default and you can buy it for under 000 for the free unix  platforms i cant see this causing major problems      i think you will find that the active linux and 000bsd communities are   populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying any money for software   otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial unix   an important factor in the linux community is that source code is always   available this is probably similar in the 000bsd community however im not   really involved there many people using linux like to stay at the cutting   bleeding edge ie when kernel patches c library or compiler patches come   out people like to rebuild their entire systems the prime requirement for   all linux software is that it is available under a gnu style public license   hence linux software uses either the athena widgets or xview   individuals may write software requiring motif but i doubt it is widely   adopted  regards  richard gooch

  mike bell writes   apologies for those who have read this before but noone has solved this    one yet so im posting again sorry                                       im having problems creating a cursor bigger than 00x00 im using motif 00  x00r0 running hpux 000  all the functions return valid results but no  cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size i tried    using the following code    unsigned int wh  xquerybestcursorxtdisplayprogramarea xtwindowprogramarea 00 00 w  h    to return the nearest size to what i require however it returns 00 and 00 as  the width and height respectively what am i doing wrong and if not how can i  get round the problem  does the workstation youre using have hardware cursor support  or does the server generate a software cursor  you can generally tell the difference just by using it  if the cursor blinks a lot when theres screen activity its probably a software cursor  if it has a hardware cursor i think youre probably battling a bug in hps x server  im not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 00x00  its quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it  i vaguely recall that very old mit server revisions did just  that  in reality youre probably stuck with a 00x00 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns  joel

  richard gooch writes    really involved there many people using linux like to stay at the cutting   bleeding edge ie when kernel patches c library or compiler patches come   out people like to rebuild their entire systems the prime requirement for   all linux software is that it is available under a gnu style public license   hence linux software uses either the athena widgets or xview   individuals may write software requiring motif but i doubt it is widely   adopted  shameless plug  the xaw0d widgets make athena a much nicer alternative than the stock mit athena code  mike     michael j oconnor             internet  mjofmsrl0srlfordcom  ford motor company opeo        uucp      fmsrl0opeomjo  00000 rotunda bldg 00000     phone     0 000 0000000  dearborn mi  00000             fax       0 000 0000000

    berryduriancitruqozau andrew berry writes   ports of motif to both 000bsd and linux are available for a fee of about  000  this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to  redistribute  the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups  pertaining to motif has been high      i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial  and noncommercial software ie you will only get free software using  athena or openlook widget sets and only get commercial software using  the motif widget sets        i cant see why  if just about every workstation will come with motif  by default and you can buy it for under 000 for the free unix  platforms i cant see this causing major problems    let me add another of my concerns yes i can buy a port of motif for cheap but i cannot get the source for cheap hence i am limited to using whatever x libraries the motif port was compiled against at least with older versions of motif i have been told that motif 00 can be used with any x but i have not seen it myself    currently i have x00r0 running on eight different unix platforms of which only three came with motif on those three i am unable to use the x00r0 libraries to build motif clients because i get link errors between the vendorsupplied port of motif and my x00r0 i anticipate having this same problem when x00r0 becomes available    the result is that i cannot build motif clients that rely on x00r0 since i do not have motif compiled under x00r0 true i could buy another port of motif but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free doesnt it      cheers      tom mcconnell    tom mcconnell               internet tmcconnesedonaintelcom  intel corp c000          phone 0000000000  0000 w chandler blvd  the opinions expressed are my own no one in   chandler az  00000     their right mind would claim them

     you seem to be a little confused  the socialistic hackers who yell  about proprietary software are hardly enamored of motif which is just  as objectionable to that mindset as news is    if i might wear my socialistic hacker hat for a moment i tar news and  motif with the same brush and that brush is not technical   begging everyones pardon i was not slamming motif nor was i necessarily  pluggingflaming the two  i was responding to the sweet blithe statement in  rick000000000digibd from rickdigibddigibdcom rick richardson  rick this is one area where microsoft nt has a big advantage  since rick they control the whole show there are no issues like this where rick licensees create incompatible defacto standards  this happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works and they believe that others will also be happy to use it  i remember when sunview was hot stuff and am not by that statement endorsing sun and its products this is just my experience and when openwindows became hot stuff that was when i started hearing as mentioned before the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying  anything that was deemed proprietary including openwindows  i mentioned motif in the same breath because that is what sun has decided to turn its attention to not because i hate it  mr richardsons position i believe is a healthy one and i am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy nt if it ever shows up wanting instead everything to be free and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are  no de facto standards  it was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds  mrs henne

    i am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system  in keeping with more classic command and control type systems we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on its own monitor   i have a number of x level questions regarding this  we are devloping on unix systems using xmotif platform will be  predominantly suns probably with ports to rs0000 as well  i am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one x display and multiple screens and not multiple x displays   given this   is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other  theres nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between screens   do i have to run separate window managers on the separate screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there what are they who sells them   is a multiscreen window manager the only way i can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next   is there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screens as one logical xy plane or does the hardware only provide for each screen to start at 00   any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a system capable of using either multiple screens or a single screen perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screens instead   i am assuming that this is not a major issue  that i can rely on providing config files which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application  any thoughts or suggestions from past experience are more than welcome    jo pelkey                                   phone 0000000000 battelle pacific northwest labs             fax   0000000000 mail stop k000                             email jepelkeypnlgov po box 000 richland wa  00000    
  gday  windows nt is a step forward but not by much i guess for dos users who think multitasking is really neat add puke here and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 00k of memory its a major improvement for windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most unix users take for  granted most of  windows users only use pcs for text processing or running  0rdparty applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue my ideal operating system  binary compatible across all plaforms it should recognize binaries and configure on the fly so i dont have to have binmac bindos bindec binsun binhp etc  multicpu so i can use the cpus on my pc and ws and mac  and transputers and dsps i dont know a single site which  has gone for a single vendor i am not going to tradein  00mflops per h0 transputer or ultrafast fft on dsp chips note nt runs on symmetric multicpu systems  builtin portable guigraphics tools you can call drawbutton  or drawline and it does the same thing no matter what platform  or display it should also translate graphics commands onthefly so i can use pc graphics sw on my workstation and x software on   my pc i think guis are not just nice to have but essential  configurable frontend so you can make it look like unix or dos or nt or os0 and run shell scripts or commandbat files  object oriented so i can program easily under it and not have to reinvent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch or my application needs to access sourceobject code on the fly  in other words it should have some ai capability that and a tight clean kernel so you can actually understand it anyone know of something like this   adios      ata     mail          dr ata etemadi blackett laboratory                                          space and atmospheric physics group                                          imperial college of science technology and medicine          internetarpanetearnbitnet ataespvaphicacuk or atacmssluclacuk    span                              spvaatae       or     msslcatae

    given a program running on a workstation with an x based window  system how can one pop the window in which it is running to the top  by window i mean the terminal window from which it was invoked  one cant  the application may not have been started from a terminal emulator if it was the terminal emulator may not still exist and if it does it may be in no condition to be popped to the top eg it may be iconified  and even if you can it may not do what you want  consider a virtualroot window manager like tvtwm with the relevant window in a portion of the virtual desktop thats outside the real desktop  some but not all x terminal emulators provide environment variables giving a window id  even if such a thing is present in the environment it may not be what you want it may correspond to a window on a different server for example  der mouse  mousemcrcimmcgilledu  
    ive seen a lot of different terms which seem to mean the same  thing  who can give an exact definition what these terms mean    multiscreen   multiheaded   multidisplay   xserver zaphod mode  as applied to servers the first three are fuzzy terms  multiheaded tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors sometimes even multiple screens even if theyre multiplexed onto the same monitor eg a sun with a cg0 display  multiscreen and multidisplay would if taken strictly mean different things but since the strict meaning of multidisplay would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers when its used it probably refers to the same thing multiscreen would a system that provides multiple screens  zaphod is a term applied to the way the mit server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen   is there a limit how many screensdisplays a single server can handle  in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 00   there is a protocol limitation that restricts a given display to at most 000 screens  i know of no server that handles multiple displays on a single invocation unless possibly my kludges to the r0 server can be looked upon as such on a tcpbased system there is necessarily a limit of 00000 displays per machine but this is not a limitation inherent to x  what you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation probably the mit one  if it claimed there was a limit of 00 inherent to x the author of the article had no business writing about x  der mouse  mousemcrcimmcgilledu  
    i am using an x server that provides 0 visuals pseudocolor 0 bit  truecolor 00 bit and directcolor 00 bit  lucky dog    a problem occurs when i try to create a window with a visual that is  different from the visual of the parent which uses the default  visual which is tc00   in the xlib reference guide from o reilly one can read in the  section about xcteatewindow something like      in the current implementation of x00 when using a visual other      than the parents be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap      which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or      else a badmatch occurs   this warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer  editions of the x00r0 guides  it applies with equal force to earlier versions  presumably only recently did the authors decide it was important enough to mention the necessity it refers to has always been there but its been implicit in the way createwindow requests default some attributes of the new window   however even if i pass along a suitable colourmap i still get a  badmatch when i create a window with a nondefault visual     attrcolormap  cmap    win  xcreatewindow             copyfromparent        border width             0                     depth             inputoutput           class             vinfovisual          visual             cwcolormap            attr            this is because the warning you read is incomplete  you have to provide not only a colormap but also a border  the default border is copyfromparent which is not valid when the windows depth doesnt match its parents  specify a borderpixmap of the correct depth or a borderpixel and the problem should go away  there is another problem i cant find anything to indicate that copyfromparent makes any sense as the borderwidth parameter to xcreatewindow  your xlib implementation probably defines copyfromparent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the xlib implementation not providing stricter typechecking  to be fair im not entirely certain its possible for xlib to catch this  der mouse  mousemcrcimmcgilledu  
    is there a possibility to determine via x protocol calls the size of  free memory available to the xserver  no  even if you could the answer could be out of date even before you get it even if you grab the server it could be taken up by buffering user actions  you should just try to do whatever you want a badalloc error is your indication that insufficient server memory is available  der mouse  mousemcrcimmcgilledu  
   distribution comp  please dont misuse newsgroup hierarchy names as distributions    i wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area  of its childs  yes but its not an attribute of the window its an attribute of the gc used to do the drawing  set the subwindowmode to includeinferiors rather than the default clipbychildren  der mouse  mousemcrcimmcgilledu

  stan kerr writes  when some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows  are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly forcing the server  to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors it doesnt happen  i have the exact same problem when running hewlett packards microwave design system mds from an hp 000 unix box and running macx 00 sys 000 normally mds draws a window with a deep blue backround but occasionally it becomes a light blue and all the text etc inside the window become washed out nearly invisible i thought that it was just something brain dead that i was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or init  by slightly moving the window and forcing a redraw the colors get corrected  harry wolfson wolfsonllmitedu

  id like to compile x00r0 on a sony nws0000 running news 00c  the x distribution has support for this config and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine  but also in the release notes nothing from sony is listed under the supported servers  what am i supposed to use for my r0 x server then  how can the os be supported but not the hardware is there something in the r0 binaries that can be used as the r0 server these may seem like silly questions but im really confused   mikehopperacsvirginiaedu   i will not raise taxes on the middle class unknown  
  heres what i think have figured out  all i need to do is install the r0 disitribution without the xserver like the sonycf file defines and all the new libraries utils etc will be installed and my old server from r0 will still work  this will allow me to run xview 00 and have x00r0 up and running  does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs  another question is it likely that since sun is dropping ow support that the desktop utils like the file manager will be made public it would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets    mikehopperacsvirginiaedu   i will not raise taxes on the middle class unknown  
    forgive me if this is a faq i have checked the list but i cant find it  i have a problem with the cursor within xterm on mono not grayscale monitors the problem is that when i have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field  the solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block but how do you do this i cant find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done  when the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block this would also be preferable but i cant seem to force this to be the default either  configuration is   motorola 00k x00r0  please reply by email if poss  thank you      steve weet  european mis  motorola cellular subscriber group beechgreen court chineham basingstoke hants england phone  00 0000 000000  email  stevewchinehameurocsgmotcom fax    00 0000 000000  mobile   00 0000 000000  post  w00000        steve weet  european mis  motorola cellular subscriber group beechgreen court chineham basingstoke hants england phone  00 0000 000000  email  stevewchinehameurocsgmotcom   fax    00 0000 000000  mobile   00 0000 000000  post  w00000

   hi folks  as part of my selfintroduction to x ive been trying to do some simple icon animation sort of like icondoit from mswindows  changing your own applications icon is fairly simple  if you have a widget id you can just xtsetvalues on xtniconifypixmap or whatever and youre done alternately you can set window manager hints  these methods dont seem to work with icons which your application doesnt specifically own  in my situation i have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in  my icon box so my question is  given a windowid how do you change the icon pixure   a working example would be very much appreciated  if it makes any difference im using motif 00 on vms t000ke  thanks  scott   
  contentsproblems with table widgets in r0  the following part of a program an user interface for a simulation system did work in r0 but refused to in r0 of cause the r0version did not know about the xptablewidgetclass we used tablewidgetclass instead  caught from the net in times of r0 and xptablechildposition formerly xttblposition since compiling with r0 the program causes a zero width or height error on sparcstations the troubleshooter is the recomputation of the modelinittable  table widget though its childs label and asciitext  widgets exist xtquerygeometry returns a prefered width and height of zero  thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the width and height of the newly created widget to zero no wonder xtpopup or xtmanage child create zero width or height errors dependent on whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource file or not  question does anyone know why xtquerygeometry returns so low prefered values when working

     actually i must also ask the faqs 0 most popular reason why graphics    dont show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your    rectangle  suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics  a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea  or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the window is mapped  the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is visible and mapped  do you know the best way to tickle a window so that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item  
   hessswt0informatikunihamburgde writes   i wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area of  its childs if it is not then how could it be possible to implement a   rubberband across multiple xwindows to select the objects that are  displayed one in each window  use a gc with the subwindowmode attribute set to includeinferiors the default is clipbychildren however beware if any of the children are of a different depth to the parent the semantics of this are undefined by the protocol   gerard odriscoll gerardodriscolldpscouk  du pont pixel systems ltd

  deleted  in plain motify using a dialog inline like this simply isnt done you need to set callbacks from the buttonswidgets in your dialog and let the callback routines do the work in the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic   xview from sun actually supports this very neatly with a notify box which can return a status inline it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event driven style of an application  summary redesign required                       delta hedging a long option position also                    generates a short gamma exposure and any return           generated from delta hedging options can be thought              of as compensation for assuming gamma risk          radioactive investment management whew  
   if youre willing to do a little work you can make drawnbuttons do what you want moreorless one of my colleagues here at ge crd has done just that in our internal lymb system  we have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap clicking the button advances the knobs state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence  using drawnbuttons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget but thats normally not a big shortcoming you can make things look circular enough   skip montanarocrdgecom why cant x be this easy  me after learning about dlopen

    is there aything available for x similar to quickeys for the macintosh  something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes menu selections and mouse actions  directing them towards another application  if so could someone send me information on its availability  and if not how hard do we think it might be to send input to other x applications and hopefully deal with their responses appropriately  if an application is going to take a few seconds to process i probably have to wait  for it to complete before sending another command  thanks  david    
  0nd posting of the question that just doesnt seem to get answered  suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics  a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea  or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular expose events eg window managerdriven exposures take care of rendering the new image  using an expose event handler is a proper way to do this because at the time the handler is called the xlib window is guaranteed to be mapped  the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped  what we need to do is somehow tickle the window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item  what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior

   0nd posting of the question that just doesnt seem to get answered  how can we resist a questions that says something like this   the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window  is already visible and mapped  what we need to do is somehow tickle the  window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable  it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item    what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior  if your expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed rectangle information then you can use xcleararea to generate an expose event assuming that your background pixel is not none for the enclosing rectangle of your new item  this is still not great since any other items contained within that rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn  if your expose event handler simply redraws everything youll be doing much more work than just drawing the new item on top of the existing scene                    mike yang        silicon graphics inc                mikeysgicom           0000000000

  i have a peculiar color problem with macx apples macintosh x server id like to know if others have seen the same problem its happened with the current version 00 and with version 000 when some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly forcing the server to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors it doesnt happen for xterm windows but has happened for graphic windows and with some motif clients  i expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and when the new application starts up it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap it therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors  this makes it look ugly until its window gets priority  then macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted but now other applications are having to make do with its colormap  this is a problem with all color x servers or at least all color xservers i have seen when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap my solution is usually to 0 avoid colormapgreedy apps and 0 display applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather than in color if this is an option for the application    doug shaker voice0000000000 fax0000000000 emaildshakerqualixcom mailqualix group 0000 s norfolk st 000 san mateo ca 00000  qualix maintains a mailserver with information files and demo versions of products  if you would like more information on the mailserver send an email to qfactsqualixcom or  uunetqualixqfacts  the email should take the following form begin send help send index end name address phone   
   hi im trying to figure out how to make a window manager place the window where the create window command tells it regardless of what it may think is right my application has reason to know better  i dont want to set the overrideredirect because i do want all the embellishments that the window manager gives i just want the wm to accept my choice of location  ive tried twm tvtwm and mwm and they are all uncooperative  thanks  ethan    
    article crossposted from hpwindows    author was andy defaria    posted on mon 00 apr 0000 000000 gmt     for some reason the following code causes my x application to beep whenever i  intercept a keystroke and change its meaning  the intent of this code it to  allow date fields the following special keys    ttinsert todays date  bump day up by one  bump day down by one    i hardcoded some dates for this example  perhaps i shouldnt be using an  xmtext field for this           for some reason the following code beeps whenever any of the special keys   of tt are hit  why  the idea of this code is to interpret these   keys having the special meaning implied by the code  i would like to get   rid of the beeping but as far as i can tell im not doing the beep and    am at a lose as to understanding who and why the beeping is occuring        code deleted  from the xmtextfield man page during discussion of resources     xmnverifybell        specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed       during a verification callback  you are setting doit to false in the callback and textfield is beeping as it should  to turn off this behavior set this boolean resource to false  tom mcfarland tommccvhpcom  
    0nd posting of the question that just doesnt seem to get answered    suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains  xlib graphics  a button widget when pressed will cause a new item  to be drawn in the window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea   or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new  item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles  regular expose events eg window managerdriven exposures take care  of rendering the new image  using an expose event handler is a proper way  to do this because at the time the handler is called the xlib window is  guaranteed to be mapped    the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window  is already visible and mapped  what we need to do is somehow tickle the  window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable  it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item    what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior  if i understand your problem correctly you want to have a way to send exposures to your manager widget when your appspecific code draws xlib graphics on the window  it sounds like you might want to send an exposure using xsendevent and specifying a region if you know the region you need to send the exposure generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects you can use xcreateregion to create a region xunionrectwithregion to add the new object polygons to the region and then either use the region to clip your gc for the redraw or use xrectinregion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn keeping in mind that the stacking order of overlapping objects affects how they look  hope it helps    brian dealy                0000000000 it not knowing where its at   dealykonggsfcnasagov                thats importantits knowing uunetdftsrvkongdealy                where its not at  bdylan   brian dealy                0000000000 it not knowing where its at   dealykonggsfcnasagov                thats importantits knowing uunetdftsrvkongdealy                where its not at  bdylan

     as per your question why not have the button handler add the object and    then call the windowredraw or whatever directly  although depending  this design will work but i dont think it can take easily take advantage of expose event redraw optimization that is the whole window will be redrawn not just the area with the new item  ps  im replying here because myyour mailer didnt agree with the       return address whaleysigmakpccom

   the application creates window with a button quit and press me  the button press me pops up a dialog box the strange feature of  this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the  first time if i try to pop it up a 0nd time 0rd 0th  time   it is much slower  the shell is waiting for the windowmanager to respond to its positioning request  the windowmanager is not responding because it thinks the window is already in the right place  exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to me all information greatly received  bryan  
  does xdm work with decnet i have an ultrix machine running both tcpip and decnet i have a number of xterminals hanging off the ultrix host also running tcpip and decnet presently i am using xdm for the login procedure on the xterminals using tcpip since xdm is basically just an xwindows client shouldnt i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well  my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client it is making tcpip specific socket calls in this case the answer would be no you can not run xdm over decnet is this right or not any feedback is appreciated thanks

   i am currently attempting to get a copy of the hp widget set compiled under linux sls release with kernel 000 and am running into some problems  actually it seems that this is more of a gcc question because i got it to compile without trouble using cc on an rs0000 basically there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in lets say compositeph for instance the composite widgets insertchild procedure is set up with the type   typedef void xtwidgetproc widget  but in several places in the hp source code they reference the insertchild procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one as the prototype suggests  for example  superclasscompositeclassinsertchildw args pnumargs  now gcc chokes on this giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function  so does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in gcc or how i can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing usrincludex00compositeph or has anyone successfully built the hp widget set and have any suggestions many thanks in advance for any help    bill woodward         wpwoodaustinibmcom    try this first aix software support  billwaixwizaustinibmcom   graphics group        0000000000 i am the terror that flaps in the night

    yes its possible in fact theres some gl widget code in usrlppgl somewhere its named glibc my ibms down right now though so i cant find the exact location     warning this code feels quite bogus it does things like calling noport before winopen and then extracting an x window id from it anyway it worked just fine under aix 00 i spent last weekend trying to port it to 00 gl under 00 doesnt seem to like it and its turning into a hard job    check out your info pages it has some pretty good documentation on whan you can and cant do when mixing gl and x and how to go about doing so    rob

     i am developing an x xtxm application that will include a graphics window  of some sort with moving symbols among other things  a pure x application  could be implemented with motif widgets one of which would be an   xmdrawingarea for drawing with xlib  but i would like to take advantage of  the graphics library gl available on our ibm rs0000 sgis gl i believe    is it possible to mix x and gl in one application program  can i use gl subroutines in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window opened by me  with xopenwindow  there is a widget already defined for gl  it is the glxmdraw motif or glxdraw athena widget  it is similar to a xmdrawingarea except that it allows you to use gl calls to render into the window  look at glxlink glxunlink glxgetconfig and glxwinset in the man pages   i have never used gl before but the doc on gl winopen says that the first  time winopen is called it opens a connection to the server   also most of  the gl calls do not require a display or gc unlike most x calls  from this  initial information it appears that x and gl cannot be mixed easily   is this  true  the glxmdraw widget works pretty well  opengl will be an improvement   does pex graphigs have the same functionality of gl  i think gl is a little easier to use and a little more powerful but thats just an opinion  mileage may vary     larry d pyeatt                 the views expressed here are not internet  pyeatttexacocom    those of my employer or of anyone voice     000 0000000       that i know of with the possible                                 exception of myself  
  writes  0nd posting of the question that just doesnt seem to get answered    suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that  contains  xlib graphics  a button widget when pressed will cause a new item  to be drawn in the window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea   or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the  new  item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that  handles  regular expose events eg window managerdriven exposures take care  of rendering the new image  using an expose event handler is a proper  way  to do this because at the time the handler is called the xlib window is  guaranteed to be mapped    the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window  is already visible and mapped  what we need to do is somehow tickle the  window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable  it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item    what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior  to incrementally update the contents of windows i use the following trick  0 set the window background to none 0 call xclearareadisplay window 0 0 0 0 true 0 restore the window background to its correct value  the call to xcleararea does not repaint the window background but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window  in order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased i encapsulate the 0 operations with 0 self addressed client messages which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server  xgrabserverdisplay client message startincremental  background none xcleararea restore background  client message endincremental xungrabserverdisplay  the grabserver prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the critical section   vincent prunet sema group sophia antipolis inria       bp 00    00000 sophia antipolis cedex  france prunetsophiainriafr 00 00 00 00 00 fax00 00 00 00 00

  according to the osfmotif style guide one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him so a hourglass cursor should be shown when the application is busy or a caution cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level so defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it is a rather complicated matter when cursors have been defined for some windows eg a crosswire cursor for a drawingarea things get even more complicated my intuition says that things should be easier but is this so if anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem please let me know the topics on busy cursors in the several faqs are not helpful since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to none  hans geurtsen                       phone 00 0 0000  00000 nucletron research bv             email hgnnuclintnl                                   surface waardgelder 0                                            nl0000 th  veenendaal   
  i am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a remote display  a local display being connected to the same system that the client is executing on  i have access to the display string but can i tell from the string  if the client is executing on host foo then 0 unix0 foo0 and localhost0 are all local  under ultrix i believe that local0 is also a valid display name a shared memory connection maybe  are there other strings that i should check for  is there a better way to detect this  thank you for any help you can give me    jim atkinsonwavefront technologies inc jrawticomwhat me  a company spokesperson  get real  life is not a spectator sport   
  some time back i asked for software recommendations to  allow me to run x from my pc at home to my sparc at the office  many thanks for all replies the majority of people  recommended pcxremote from ncd i received it yesterday  and installed it on my sparc and pc with only one hitch  the unix install consists of copying 0 files into some local bin directory  on the pc side i ordered the windows version  which  came with a slick windows installation   the only problem i had was that  my xinitrc  in my home directory had the line displayhostname00 export display  st the clients i kicked off connected to my xserver on the sparc console by removing this line from the xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at  hostname00  some comments on performance i was connected to a sparc 0 thru a netblazer terminal server over a 0000 baud line my pc is a 000dx0 ati ultra 00 mb  bitmap stuff sucked basic editing and compilation stuff definitely usable xmail was very usable  at times the first time u typed in an xclient window there was a very noticable delay i put this down to brain damaged windows should not be called a scheduler besides that this will become my remote work environment for a while  has anybody tried the non windows version of the product the sales person said they performed about the same given the over head of windows i question this  many thanks for help to all who responded  gerard

  some one asked me recently why they when they used xquerybestcursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could but the server did not create cursors of that size investigation showed that some x servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size the interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware  a sun0 with a cg0 will claim cursors up to root window size are ok while a sun0 with a cg0 will stop at 00x00 so far ive also seen this behavior on ncd and phasex x terminals and have been told it also occurs on hps  actually the ncd is even more liberal  sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as ok is xquerybestcursor semibroken or is this behavior correct id really like to see a 0000x0000 cursor    richard neitzel thorthoratducaredu          torren med sitt skjegg national center for atmospheric research        lokkar borni under solevegg box 0000 boulder co 000000000                gjoi med sitt shinn 0000000000                                    jagar borni inn  
   does xdm work with decnet i have an ultrix machine running both tcpip and decnet i have a number of xterminals hanging off the ultrix host also running tcpip and decnet presently i am using xdm for the login procedure on the xterminals using tcpip since xdm is basically just an xwindows client shouldnt i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well   xdm is not just an x window client  xdm has its own protocol xdmcp that operates of ucp on port 000  it does provide a login window which is an x window client  as to using decnet protocol  looking through the source for xdm from x00r0 that i have here it seems that the bare bones code is there but not completely there   my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client it is making tcpip specific socket calls in this case the answer would be no you can not run xdm over decnet is this right or not any feedback is appreciated thanks   from my look at the source it seems you cannot run it over decnet as shipped with x00r0  patrick l mahan   tgv window washer  mahantgvcom   waking a person unnecessarily should not be considered   lazarus long a capital crime  for a first offense that is            from the notebooks of   lazarus long  
  dear xperts  im developing an application that uses a motif slider to select an image file out of a directory now i would like to display the name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale button ie with the mb0 pressed as xmnshowvalue only displays the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding image file name i thought of using an xtaddeventhandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file name  xtaddeventhandlerscaleimagebutton0motionmask  false slidermoved null   and in the eventhandler do a    while xchecktypedwindowevent display eventwindow motionnotify return       xmscalegetvaluescaleimagevalue   map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open   however when i move the pointer in the scale widget i get callbacks with of co    urse a null effect as my mb0 is not pressed to move the scale button so what is goin    g wrong or is the a wrong approach to this problem any hints are highly appreciated  phil

  i am trying to build and use imake x00r0 on an ibm rs0000 running aix v00 i am having the following 0 problems  0 many of my imakefiles have contructs like                 this is a makefile         at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c         preprocessor and into the makefile  most of the c preprocessors that         i have used will not treat such a  as appearing at the start of the         line  thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the         start of a directive           however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol         as the start of a directive  the cpp fails when it determines         that this is not a known directive  i have temporarily hacked my         imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better         fix  0 several imakefiles use  as a parameter to a macro when a particular         use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter  the aix cpp         gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok  if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions i would appreciate information about on your solutions  perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that i have not reviewed  also do you know of other cpps that behave similarly  since i do not have easy access to news a response to whitebillypogisprccom would be appreciated

  i posted this a while ago and didnt recieve one reply and now we have another bug report on the same subject can anybody help me out  how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case  what i want is ctrlo and ctrlo to both be accelerators on one menu entry  in ora vol 0 in the section on accelerators it says for information on how to specify translation tables see vol 0 this is so you know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource  if you go to vol 0 it says likewise if a modifier is specified there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well for example the translation  shiftkeyqquit  will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as the shift key and the q key  this implies to me that setting xmnaccelerator to ctrlkeyo should do what i want but it doesnt it doesnt work if the user presses the control key the shift key and the o key  is it possible to supply  0 accelerator for a menu entry keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you cant use xtinstallaccelerators  i am using motif 000 on a decstation 0000 but i have also tried it on an hp using motif 000 and 00      steve dennis              internet sdennisannarborappliconslbcom software engineer         applicon inc            ann arbor michigan hail to the victors  
   im an new to this  having found some files public to look into i ftped them to a system i have access to  i then used kermit to transmit them via modem to my host computer a pcbased file system  i access internet through modem access to a university mainframe  from the pc file server i pull the files to a disk and then pull them from disk to a sgi indigo the sgi is not networked yet  when i try to uncompress and untar the files they either come out as garbage or i get an error in the tar process about directories being invalid what im wondering about is the transfer of unix files compressed binaryascii about multiple platforms  my guess is that it is the copy to a dos disk that is screwing things up  any help is appreciated bob

  i have two questions well probably more about how expose  configure events are handled  i have an appl which uses 0 window to draw in  since i give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized i made a translation table for the expose  configure events the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event calls my rescale method  the rescale method invokes a fake expose event actually just calls the redraw w an appropriate expose struct to draw the data  quest 0 when the appl is compiledlinked w r0 running in either r0 or r0 env i get multiple 0 redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed  i assume im getting cascading events  is that right any suggestions as to how to handletrap events in a better way  quest 0 when the appl is compiledlinked w r0 i get no expose events whatsoever  do events andor translation tables act differently in r0  thanks in advance  steve     steve kelleyumcp csumiacscaptain i protest internetskelleyumiacsumdedui am not a merry man  worf

  hi  ive looked in the faq and the oreilly books and was unable to find an easy means of finding out the state of state keys such as capslock and numlock  i can certainly track the events inside of my window and set a boolean there but what if capslock is pressed in another window  i looked at xgrabkey and decided it was definitely not what i wanted to do  i could find no convenience function to tell me that information  my question is this  is there a means of determining what the state of capslock andor numlock is  an even more pointed question is there an easy means of making an x keyboard act like a pc keyboard  ie capslock is active and the user presses shifta id like to get a lowercase a instead of a  any input is greatly appreciated please respond via email  i will repost a summary of my findings  thanks ralph  
   store and reply of mouse and keyboard events   to produce regression tests or automatic demos we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events produced by a user it should be possible to filter the mouse and keyboard events from the servers queue an to store them in a file this sequence of events stored in a file should be given  to the servers queue as if a user is working   0 exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all    mouse and keyboard events where  0 where one can catch these events to store them     in our case the servers queue is on a x terminal hp    where can we catch all events coming from a given    server    if this is not possible can we catch all events given    to a certain client and how      0 where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user     is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages    all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it    thanks in advance  ron

   do anyone know about any shading program based on xlib in the public domain i need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program  appreciate the help   i dont know if this might help but ive just started playing with a program called povray persistance of vision raytracer that also displays its output via x windows  it does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my psuedocolor 0plane display  i got the source from from a site in canda the person i retrieved them from was david buck dbuckccscarletonca  patrick l mahan   tgv window washer  mahantgvcom   waking a person unnecessarily should not be considered   lazarus long a capital crime  for a first offense that is            from the notebooks of   lazarus long  
   hi im trying to figure out how to make a window manager place the window where the create window command tells it regardless of what it may think is right my application has reason to know better  i dont want to set the overrideredirect because i do want all the embellishments that the window manager gives i just want the wm to accept my choice of location   what it may think is right may be exactly what the user wants assuming that your application has reason to know better is imho antisocial  if i start your application with a geometry option are you going to ignore that as well  theres really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything if its managing your window  you can ask you can hint but theres no guarantee that youre going to get what you want   tom lastrange        tomlboulderparcplacecom  
     try this after xcreatewindow      include x00xutilh    display display  window window        xsizehints xsizehints  xallocsizehints     xsizehintsflags  usposition  ussize or  pposition  psize     xsizehintsx  00    xsizehintsy  00    xsizehintswidth  000    xsizehintsheight  000    xsetwmnormalhints display window xsizehints    xfree xsizehints      these hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window  are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these  values if you use xsizehintsflags  pposition  psize this tells the window  manager that the values are prefered values of the program not the user  i dont know a window manager that doesnt place the window like you prefer if  you specify the position and size like above   you are right but please dont do this  it makes my brain hurt usposition and ussize should only be set if the user specified the position and size  you say tom dont blow a gasket whats the harm  some window managers do very different things besides positioning the window when they see usposition rather than pposition   tom lastrange        tomlboulderparcplacecom

  again poseted for a friend  okay i got such great response from my last question thanks everyone  lets try again  how can i tell if a colorcell is readonly  i want to use any readonly cells that are already in my colormap once i start running out of allocatable cells using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color  once i determine if a cell is readonly i assume i can then just request an xalloccolor with the exact same color specifications and it will  then be flagged as used by my application so that it doesnt later get freed by someone else and allocated again as readwrite to another application  so far the only way ive figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors once my colormap is all full up  it should error out if the cell is nonshareable but life would be much easier if i could just detect the readonlyshareable stuff directly  any ideas  noel ngorelicspeclabcrusgsgov

   animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident ximages into   server resident pixmaps using xputimage  once this is done the original ximages  can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using xcopyarea from the pixmaps to the windows drawable    hope this is helpfull    john    i just implemented this and it seems i can just about achieve the display rates 00 000x000x0 frames  sec on ipx that i get with sunview though its a bit choppy at times also loading the data making an ximage then xputing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome so the animation is slower to load than with sunview is there a better way to load in the data  rgoochrpcsiroau richard gooch writes   if you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the x server   you should use the shared memory extension to the sample x server mitshm   xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension this is certainly   available with the sample mit x server running under sunos   a word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared   memory and another word of warning openwindows is slower than the mit   server   i have written an imaging tool using xview for the gui by the way which   yields over 00 frames per second for 0000000 bit images running on a sparc   ipc half the cpu grunt of an ipx this has proved quite sufficient for   animations  regards  richard gooch  shared memory putimage also mentioned by nkissebedelphibeckmanuiucedu nick kisseberth looks interesting but i need someone to point me to some documentation is this method likely to give better results than server resident pixmaps id also be interested in looking at the xview code mentioned above  thanks for the help so far if i get something decent put together ill definitely post it to the net    derek c richardson     tel 0000 000000 x 00000       institute of astronomy  fax 0000 000000               cambridge uk                                          cb0 0ha                 email dcrmailastcamacuk

     two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation  of raster files with sunview becoming rapidly obselete ive  finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview  i put together a quick test and ive found that xputimage  is considerably slower factor of 0 on average than the  sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory  pixrects to a canvas this was on a sparc ipx it seems that  0 the x protocol communication is slowing things down or  0 xputimage is inefficientor both my question is what  the protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server memory this is the hog the conversions in the xputimage are fast   is the fastest way in x00r0 to dump 0 plane image data to  a window can i take advantage of the fact that the client is  running on the same machine as the server or am i stuck with  yes by utilizing the mitshm extension that provides an xputimage derivate that uses shared memory fine fast   xputimage in which case i might as well give up now    no you can still xputimage all of the frames onto pixmaps thus moving them to server memory and then replay them fastest using xcopyarea but be aware this is a major server memory bummer    oo  o                   brain inside                         o   o                                                 o   o  andre beck abpsoft mehl andrebeckirsinftudresdende  o  oo

     a colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation when he first logs on via xdm he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running  in this configuration x windows applications particularly xdvi work fine  however if he opens up a second xterm application suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window giving the error unable to load iso 00000 font     the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the xsession file with prettier colours and other slight changes  further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour and more significant all x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window  if i start the xterm with a different font using the fn option no problems  it would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts  note xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available so there doesnt appear to be a problem in the font directorieshashtables     other than rewriting the xterm appdefaults file to use a different font and hope for the best does anyone have any ideas  more info  this is the most recent mips workstation r0000 i believe        with the most current operating system and running x00r0        it is not mwms fault as the same problems occur under twm etc

   hello  i am testing a port of x00r0 to coherent a unix clone os for intel architecture machines  i am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt a simple terminal emulator program  the problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display one at a time  the characters appear to be too closely spaced with the result being that the 0nd character echoed destroys the  rightmost edge of the first character then the 0rd character destroys the  rightmost edge of the second character and so on  it looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character  there is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text only when the output is a series of individual characters  if anyone has any ideas what the problem might be or where i should look to find it it would be much appreciated  regards and thanks jon dhuse     jon dhuse                   internet jdhusesedonaintelcom  intel  corp  ch000        phone 0000000000  0000 w chandler blvd  any opinions expressed are my own  chandler az  00000     not my employers

  i consider twmstyle squeezed titles indispensable in a window manager i like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time with no overlap and since two windows arent enough i have other xterm windows underneath them with exactly the same positioning  in case youre not familiar with squeezed titles heres a crude picture    figure 0                                             title a                     title b            title c                    this is the               window b hides window c but            body of the             you can still see cs title              window window a       which is squeezed right                    figure 0   squeezed titles allow me to have about 0 such windows in each stack with easy access and 0 per stack is usually more than i really need since i also insist on having a virtual wm  the only problem is that the title location is static that is  it is configured in twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager doing so is cumbersome and timeconsuming  therefore i have implemented fsqueeze left center right  functions in my own copy of vtwm the idea being that with one click of a button you can change this            title a              this is the                    body of the                   window window a         to this                                          title a              this is the                    body of the                   window window a            okay so far so good now how the heck do i get them to put this into the next official twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm and the next ctwm and the next xyztwm that i never heard of  one way would be to post in compwindowsx a description of this enhancement together with an explanation of why i think it is a very good thing and hope that someone reads it   in case it isnt already clear why i think its a very good thing look back up at figure 0 and picture window a moved over on top of windows b and c now window as title hides window bs title but when you hit fsqueezecenter the result is                          title b     title a     title c                      this is the body of the window               window a which is on top                      the rest of this posting explains how to implement it based on my x00r0 copy of vtvwmshar its just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long  the key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the executefunction routine in menusc  ifdef shape case fsqueezeleft static squeezeinfo leftsqueeze   jleft 0 0  if deferexecution context func scrselectcursor   return true  tmpwinsqueezeinfo  leftsqueeze setframeshape tmpwin  break   and similarly for squeezeright  jright  and squeezecenter  jcenter   endif   of course you also have to define fsqueezeleft in parseh   and add      fsqueezeleft fkeyword fsqueezeleft        and so forth  to parsec  in order to use these functions add something like the following to your twmrc file  button0  m  s  wvdritdoor  fsqueezecenter     about a year ago i posted this but our news was broken and i think it didnt get out  since then blast has appeared in compsourcesx volume 00 issue 00 you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by chiseling away at an mwmstyle wide title better to have a twmstyle window manager i think   ralph betza fm uunetssinygnohmon         gnohmonssinycom  the question of whether a computer can swim is more interesting  than the question of whether a submarine can think  lenny dykstra

   in sdennis000000000aacadslbcom sdennisosforg writes    i posted this a while ago and didnt receive one reply and now we  have another bug report on the same subject can anybody help me out    the problem is that motif uses xgrabkey to implement menu accelerators  and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply  unfortunately  the specification for xgrabkey doesnt allow anymodifier to be combined  with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case  ctrl anykeyq    in ora vol 0 in the section on accelerators it says for information  on how to specify translation tables see vol 0 this is so you  know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource  if you go to  vol 0 it says likewise if a modifier is specified there is  nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well for  example the translation  shiftkeyqquit  will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as  the shift key and the q key    this is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using  event handlers instead of grabs its not true for menu accelerators  if  youre a motif implementor id suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics  changed to support the feature i described above  otherwise change the  documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the users  expectations because menu accelerators are not the same thing as  translations    is it possible to supply  0 accelerator for a menu entry    if you mean menu accelerator no its not possible  thats according to  the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page    keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you  cant use xtinstallaccelerators    i cant think of a reason why not    how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of  case  what i want is ctrlo and ctrlo to both be accelerators on one  menu entry  i find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing  if i were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators i would have one resource called accelerators that took a translation table period i would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed  as soon as the enduser specified one it would be active and automatically installed  to get multiple accelerators on a single menu item id do something like  menuitemaccelerators override n ctrlkeymfire n shiftkeylfire n  the accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a ctrl m show up in your menuitem object  why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different special cases depending on what type of widget youre dealing with  there has to be some reason  sorry for the political tone of this message   tom lastrange        tomlboulderparcplacecom  
   one advanage of mitshm is that if your images are large you dont end up  growing the size of the server process to hold them    correct most x servers use a version of  malloc0  which will not return   memory to the os ie the x server might  free0  a pixmap but the heap does   not shrink   one disadvantage of the mitshm is that in its sample implementation  there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments  if the client dies a sudden violent death eg kill  you have to   be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments    well part of the routines i mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around   that problem first i create the shared memory segment attach the client   attach the x server and then remove  the segment if you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone   now if the client dies thats one attachment gone the os cleans up for you   and since the x server notices the client has dies frees up its resources   including detaching from the segment there goes the last attachment no more   shared memory segment   terrible but it works  regards  richard gooch

  i am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics and imagery  the user of the widget will be able to specify when creating it whether it is to operate in x or gl mode  i have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button presses  they work fine when the widget is in x mode  in gl  mode they only work when the widget my glx widget is a child of a manager  put another way the translations do not work  when the widget is configured in gl mode and is a child of a  shell  does anyone know why this is happening  thanks in advance bruce gendler bgendlercsccom

    lets say i have two rectangles on the canvassee above   one intersecting the other  now i would like to delete one of the rectangles  the way i do it is to create another gc wherein i use the  gxxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly  created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes  a problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel   locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white which is   something that should be avoided  you could set up a bitmap with a mask in it  clear the bitmap draw the rectangle to be deleted with gxor  draw the one that is to stay with gxclear  then gxxor the entire pixmap with the screen    note that this is a pretty effective way of animation if you ever need to do that replace the gxclear with a gxxor   joe hildebrand hildjjfuentezcom software engineer fuentez systems concepts 0000000000  standard disclaimers apply

      i need probably to write one or more new motif widgets on the hpux    platform do i need the motif private header files and source    or can i make do with the public headers that are provided    motif includes xt in this context  yes  youll find it almost impossible without the source at this point  it does depend on how ambitious you are and how concerned you are about compliance with the general interface and items like traversal     one widget is a multicolumn list which lots of people have    already written i am sure and would therefore be probably be    a subclass of list rather than something simple like an xt class    is this more difficult in principle not lines of code  im not sure what youre asking  you could create something which is very much like a true multicolumn list by placing several lists within a geometry manager  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window  this wouldnt be good for very large lists  but you might consider this as an alternative     alternatively if anyone has a multicolumn list widget they    could sell me this might save me from having to write one    does it by any chance exist in motif 00 already i do not    yet have the spec  motif 00 does not have a multicolumn list in it  have you looked at commercial sets  there are also some pd  widget sets  one of these might have a multicolumn list you could port    douglas s rand drandosforgosfmotif dev snail         00 cambridge center  cambridge  ma  00000 disclaimer    i dont know if osf agrees with me lets vote on it amateur radio kc0kj  
   my question is this  is there a means of determining what the state  of capslock andor numlock is  alright  ignore this  i have delved a bit deeper xkeyevent and found what i was looking for  evstate   has a bunch of masks to check against lockmask is the one for capslock  unfortunately it appears that the numlock mask varies from server to server  how does one tell what mask is numlock and which are for meta mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask eg sgis vendor server has mod0mask being numlock whereas solaris 000 openwindows 00 has mod0mask for numlock  is there an unambiguous means of determining numlocks mask at runtime for any given server  sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance  thanks ralph

  cutsie little macintrashlike icons that are an instant recipe for mousitis imho system 0 is undoubtedly the worst gui i have used out of that riscos mswombles and x00 simply because it does not provide enough keyboard shortcuts windows i must confess i quite like cover your ears   because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the mouse stuff delete the user rather than making things easier  and there should always be the option to do it your way if you want to which is why i like the unixx combination so much  its so customizable   hear hear i agree completely one thing i cant stand about the mac interface is its shear determination to force you to use the mousewhat if your mouse breaksyour whole system is down  i like the mouseit is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around etc  but for most work the keyboard and hot keys are 0000 times faster than using the mouse sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it before your are experienced a month two speaking of pcs at the moment i dont think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menumouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in less time if you are experienced all of the above equally applies to windowing systems on unix especially since unix is at least 000 more powerful than dos       seth buffington uss gab 000 i   0000000000             sethcsuntedusethgabunteduunix operator

   i am trying to build and use imake x00r0 on an ibm rs0000 running aix v00 i am having the following 0 problems  0 many of my imakefiles have contructs like this is a makefile at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c preprocessor and into the makefile  most of the c preprocessors that i have used will not treat such a  as appearing at the start of the line  thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive   however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive  the cpp fails when it determines that this is not a known directive  i have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix  0 several imakefiles use  as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter  the aix cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok  if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions i would appreciate information about on your solutions  perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that i have not reviewed  also do you know of other cpps that behave similarly  since i do not have easy access to news a response to whitebillypogisprccom would be appreciated

       sorry but olwm and tvtwm dont do it they place the title at that position    and the window at a position below it     this becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current    configuration and restore is later     currently my solution is     xcreatewindow    xsetwmproperties    xmapwindow    xflush    xmovewindow      it works with olwm but is less than elegant all this leaves me wondering    if im overlooking something obvious     richard   i know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the user window maybe other window managers have similar options another way to figure out the difference between the user window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window unfortunately you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way  greeting           tobias badingcstuberlinde

  ralph seguin rpsarbortextcom wrote   my question is this  is there a means of determining what the state   of capslock andor numlock is   alright  ignore this  i have delved a bit deeper xkeyevent and  found what i was looking for   evstate   has a bunch of masks to check against lockmask is the one  for capslock  unfortunately it appears that the numlock mask varies  from server to server  how does one tell what mask is numlock and  which are for meta mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask  eg sgis vendor server has mod0mask being numlock whereas solaris  000 openwindows 00 has mod0mask for numlock  is there an  unambiguous means of determining numlocks mask at runtime for any  given server  sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance  youll have to check the keysyms on each of the keys for each modifier the one with numlock in its mapping is the modifier you want a bit ugly perhaps but i think its currently the only way to do this and it does have some precedent as keysyms are  used to differentiate capslock from shiftlock for the lock modifier  i dont know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous assignments either ie what if numlock is mapped for more then one modifier i suppose first found is as good as any  x doesnt handle locking modifiers that well   hope that helps  dave lapp  standard disclaimer etc

   i know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the user window maybe other window managers have similar options another way to figure out the difference between the user window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window unfortunately you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way  another way would be to use getgeometry to find out where you are relative to the frame and translatecoordinates to find out where your windows upperleft corner really is  ethan

       i am working on an xwindow based application that needs to  override some of the window manager focus processing  i am  using x00r0 and motif 00 currently although i will also be  working with open look in the future       what i need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the  user from switching from one window of the application to  another window  lets say for example that window a is on top  of window b in the window hierarchy  normally if the user clicks  the mouse in window b it will be brought to the top of the  window hierarchy and placed on top of window a  under certain  circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in window b i need to  beep and prevent window b from being raised on top of window  a        from the research and testing ive done so far it appears that  this window ordering is handled by the window manager in this  case motif  i havent found any way to override this default  processing through standard x window functions  i can tell  when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping  notify events but i cant find any way to tell motif not to make the  switch        the temporary solution ive currently come up with is very  kludgy but it partially works  when i detect such a window switch  in those cases when the switch is not allowed i manually force  the formerly top window back on top with an xraisewindow call  and beep with the xbell function  this provides the necessary  functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places  twice        does anyone know how i can tell motif or preferably any  window manager when i dont want the window order switch to  actually take place  respond either by email or posting to this  newsgroup  cheers     randall    randall severy                          uunet uunetgesevery           ge information services              internet geseveryuunetuunet    000 n washington st   mc00a           genie rsevery                   rockville md  00000    usa             phone 00000000000

    cutsie little macintrashlike icons that are an instant recipe for  mousitis imho system 0 is undoubtedly the worst gui i have used out of  that riscos mswombles and x00 simply because it does not provide enough  keyboard shortcuts windows i must confess i quite like cover your ears    because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the  mouse  stuff delete  the user rather than making things easier  and there should always be  the option to do it your way if you want to which is why i like the  unixx combination so much  its so customizable     hear hear i agree completely one thing i cant stand about  the mac interface is its shear determination to force you to use  the mousewhat if your mouse breaksyour whole system is  down  i like the mouseit is handy on some occassions such  as cut and past and moving icons around etc  but for most  work the keyboard and hot keys are 0000 times faster than  using the mouse sure it is a plus to be able to do something  simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it  before your are experienced a month two speaking of pcs at  the moment  i dont think it is too much to ask that window  programmers provide not only a menumouse interface but also  look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and  command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in  less time if you are experienced  all of the above equally applies to windowing systems on  unix especially since unix is at least 000 more powerful than  dos   and at least 000 more user unfriendly as well

   tcpview is the result of several problems we had at uw  we have several network general sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets these are good tools but they are 0 heavy  0 hard to find when you need one 0 limited in their software expandibility 0 difficult to use to upload data for analysis 0 cannot be remotely operated and 0 cannot resolve names with dns requiring much manual  manipulation of the name table  we also sometimes use tcpdump but we found  it 0 too difficult for most people 0 did not have enough information for many protocols 0 could not be used interactively 0 could not handle tcp streams and 0 could not read sniffer files  however tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols and could be easily modified  tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features  tcpview has been tested on a decstation 0000 and sun 0 under ultrix 00 and sunos 00 respectively  it should work on the same systems as tcpdump it compiles with cc and gcc on the dec and sun  to build tcpview you will need motif 00 or better  the following files are available for anonymous ftp from  ftpcacwashingtonedu in pubnetworking  tcpview00tarztcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview00suntarzsun0 binaries tcpview00dectarzdec mips ultrix 00 binaries  what tcpview adds to tcpdump  easier interface  enhanced protocol decoding  hex display of frame  capture based on time number of frames or user interrupt  can show ethernet addresses with manufacturers name  ethernet address host table  can easily follow a stream highlighting outoforder frames  can send tcp data to an external file or filter for additional processing   changes to tcpdump 000  new features  now reads and writes network general sniffer files  when used with r the  file type will be automatically detected  can now read in and use an snmp mib file  the hex format has been changed  new time options have been added  options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in tcp packets  bugs were fixed in the relative tcp sequence numbers s flag  new flags rread sniffer file  not usually needed except for reading from stdin tttprints delta times ttttprints times relative to the first frame wwrite a sniffer save file use with w xprint frame minus linklevel header in hexdump format   sample output  000000000000 jeffcacwashingtonedu0000  nicfunetfiftp s 000 win 00000         0000  00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 0c 00 0c 0c 00 0f 00 00     ep         0000  00 d0 00 00 00 00 00 00 0b 00 0a 00 00 00 00 00     dj         0000  00 00 00 00 0e 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00           pn  xprint tcp data in hexdump format used with z zwrite tcp data to stdout use with t to eliminate timestamp zwrite frames and tcp data to stdout   martin m hunt martinhcacwashingtonedu networks  distributed computing university of washington          martin hunt                            martinhcacwashingtonedu    networks and distributed computing     university of washington    
   we developed a toolkit running on the x window system the toolkit copes with any languages based on x00r0s i00n facility as you know there are 0 kinds of i00n implementation from mits  x00r0 release  xsi and ximp our original implementation of the toolkit uses xsi  our toolkit manages each characters size based on our own font management system in order to do that the wchart typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets this means that if one wchart type compound string with  ascii and kanji mixed for example is given each element of the wchart array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environments locale in this case if the locale is japanese each wchart character will be classified either to iso00000 jisx0000 or so  we need a function to do this the function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is  we could not find any public x00r0 function to do that and inevitably used xsis internal functions to construct that function the following is the source code of that function decomposecharacterset   i00nh  this may look like c code but it is really  c   id i00nhv 00 00000000 000000 iima exp iima   ifndef i00nh define i00nh  include x00xlibh  extern int decomposecharactersetconst wchart wcstr in   int wclen in   char buf out   int buflen inout   int scannedlen out   char charset out  extern xmstring wchartoxmstringconst wchart wcstr extern xmstringcharset charsetofwcharconst wchart wc  endif  i00nh   i00ncc  id i00nccv 00 00000000 000000 iima exp    include stdlibh include x00xlibinth include xmxmh include i00nh  extern c  include x00wcharh define xwcdecomposeglyphcharset xxxxwcdecomposeglyphcharset define xmbfscs xxxxmbfscs define xmbctidtocsid xxxxmbctidtocsid include xlocaleinth undef xwcdecomposeglyphcharset undef xmbfscs undef xmbctidtocsid     extern int xwcdecomposeglyphcharsetxlocale const wchart int  char int int int     extern charset xmbfscsxlocale csid     extern csid xmbctidtocsidxlocale csid   int decomposecharactersetconst wchart wcstr in    int wclen in    char buf out    int buflen inout    int scannedlen out    char charset out       xlocale xlocale  xfallbackconvert     int ctid     int status     charset xcharset          status  xwcdecomposeglyphcharsetxlocale wcstr wclen buf        buflen scannedlen ctid     if status  success  xcharset  xmbfscsxlocale xmbctidtocsidxlocale ctid charset  xcharset  xcharsetcsname  null          else charset  null     return status    an included file above xlocaleinth is also xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled  a serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our hp machine with its os version of hpux000  when we tried to link an application based on our toolkit link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing     xmbctidtocsid code     xmbfscs code     xwcdecomposeglyphcharset code     xfallbackconvert code  we had used mit release version of x00r0 and its xsi implementation until hpup00 and ran applications successfully one of the reasons to use xsi was that because hp did not release hps x00r0 until the os 00 and we had no way to  know how hps r0 would be implemented we had hoped xsis popularity and used  its internal functions   the hps linker complains that there are no xsi internal functions implemented we observe from hps libx00a they used some ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used mits vanilla ximp version or their own version of ximp and therefore finding just counter part functions in mits ximp for xsi does not seem to lead us a solution  my question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like decomposecharacterset listed above is there any function to check character set of each element of wchart type strings depending on locales if it is a public function that is perfect but even if it is not we want to use any internal functions in hps x00r0 as we did for mits r0  in order to render a wchart type string there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string we have no way to find out that without any hps x00r0 source  files we want to know how we can use that for our goal  any help or comments would be highly appreciated  i also appreciate if anyone tell me about ximp treating around this area even if it is not hps implementation  thank you   takeshi inoue inouecrdyokogawacojp yokogawa electric corporation open systems laboratory0000000000

  excerpts from netnewscompwindowsx 00apr00 x toolkits paul prescodundergradm 0000   i get the impression andrew is from the fsf but i dont know what it  looks like either  the andrew user interface system is supported maintained enhanced and distributed by the andrew consortium carnegie mellon  the distribution terms are those of the x consortium not the gnu public license  thus anyone can commercially exploit the andrew code without restriction  to encourage membership however we defer universal release of the latest versions until consortium members have had an opportunity to explore the new capabilities  to se what auis looks like you can try a remote demo  you need an x server r0 is best on a machine linked to the internet  give the command   finger helpatkitccmuedu   for instructions  note  the demo version does not use the motiflookandfeel scrollbar but one is available  you can use it on the demo by changing an option in the preferences file and starting a new editor  the andrew toolkit component of auis is ideal if you want to build applications using compound documents  andrews major feature is its architecture for recursive embedding of objects equation in table in figure in text for example  this architecture extends to areas not usually found in toolkits including file stream formats cutpaste and printing  andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications  word processor spreadsheet drawing editor and font editor the latter two are in version 00 which will be generally released on the xr0 tape in december  fred hansen director andrew consortium

  does anybody have an x server for nt that theyre willing to share files or experiences  bill steer westinghouse  
  we have an old sun000 here which gets occasional use  when x00r0 is started on it any console messages during startup are undeletable  after x is fully started we run an xterm as the console  the problem is that any messages that arrive before this starts go to the plain console  refresh window fails to remove them  the messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of the screen obscuring anything else below them  at boot time the 000 lists two framebuffers    devcgfour0 and devbwtwo0 were running x in color and i suspect that maybe the offending messages are on the bw framebuffer and thereby not getting deleted  my question is has anyone else seen this and is there an easy way to get rid of these messages  please reply by email to hughminmoscouk  hugh mcintyre inmos ltd bristol uk  btw sunos 000 x00r0 mwm  ps i know i can redirect output of the relevant commands to devnull  im     looking for a more general solution  
      im writing an x server for some videogeneration equipment  the  hardware is truecolor in yuv space in x terms it has a 00bit  static color visual  i would really like to have the server just  present this static visual but im not sure if this will be   acceptable to most x clients  the three problems i see are      0 the colormap though huge is static    0 all pixels would be 0 bytes wide    0 because the hardware actually lives in yuv space the       translation rgbyuv will introduce some rounding error    being more of a server guy than a client guy i ask will these  limitations thwart many x clients  or will most of the x stuff  floating around blithely accept what theyre given  i could write  the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of eg 0 bits   but id rather avoid this if not necessary    even 00bit truecolor machines are in most cases running an emulated 0 bit pseudocolor visual only to get standard x clients motif apps and thelike to run i strongly suppose you to emulate at least   00 bit truecolor should be no problem only some translation rounding   should not make big misfits  0 bit pseudocolor more of a problem you have to emulate a colormap   pixel indices conversion stuff furthermore you should run your default   screen on this visual   oo  o                   brain inside                         o   o                                                 o   o  andre beck abpsoft mehl andrebeckirsinftudresdende  o  oo

   even 00bit truecolor machines are in most cases running an emulated 0 bit pseudocolor visual only to get standard x clients motif apps and thelike to run i strongly suppose you to emulate at least   00 bit truecolor should be no problem only some translation rounding   should not make big misfits  depends on the nature of the rounding  x allows the user to do bit arithmetic on pixel values ie  xor foreground and backgroun pixel values together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a function of gxxor fill change foreground to background and viceversa if your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then  clients that use them will break  ken  kenneth whaley 000 0000000 kubota pacific computer inc email whaleykpccom 0000 walsh avenue santa clara ca  00000

    no it isnt  it is the x window system or x00 or x or any of  a number of other designations accepted by the x consortium  in fact  doing man x on pretty much any x00 machine will tell you         the x consortium requests that the following names  be  used       when referring to this software                                      x                             x window system                               x version 00                       x window system version 00                                   x00    there is no such thing as x windows or x window despite the repeated  misuse of the forms by the trade rags  this probably tells you something  about how much to trust the trade rags  if they cant even get the name  of the window system right why should one trust anything else they have   to say  i used to think this way and not just about x for example incorrect english constructs such as its raining or its window id annoy me however there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world indeed the fact that x won out over news was really down to popular opinion i know we all think its technically superior as well  on a related topic who is to say that color is more or less correct than colour  being irish and hence using english english as opposed to american english i always use the latter except of course for api terms such as xalloccolor and colormap  in a world that uses the term windows to refer to microsoft windows perhaps the time has come to accept x windows as a valid term for x i think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than say the x window system and lets face it almost everyone uses it ultimately we all need product sales to more than just xliterate people in this respect product recognition is important and a short snappy descriptive title x is positively obscure will help when dealing with the average punter its sad  i thought i was a software engineer indeed it is unfortunate that x did not become popularly known as windows and let ms worry about whether it should be called microsoft windows or the microsoft window system or how about just plain microsoft  to summarise or should that be summarize the point of this message i think there are far more pressing issues facing the x community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system or should that be windowing system whatever gets recognised is fine by me i agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say however i would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the x window system   gerard odriscoll gerardodriscolldpscouk du pont pixel systems ltd

  the xview version 0 source distribution included in the contrib section  of x00r0 included the source to the textedit program  id like to take  the sources and modify them to add support for a tooltalklike message  server and maybe for tooltalk while im at it since the sunsupplied textedit binary doesnt seem to speak tooltalk  however the sources in the r0 contrib area seem to be for an older version of textedit than the version shipped with openwindows 0  for example the own 00 textedit includes drag and drop support and a  dropsite in the main control area while the source in contribxview knows nothing about drag and drop  the texteditc included in the xview sources says its version 0000 dated 00000 while doing a what textedit on the own 00 binary says          texteditc 000 000000 copyr 0000 sun micro         dragdropc 000 000000 copyr 0000 sun micro         tooltalkc 000 000000 copyr 0000 sun micro         dsrelnamec    00 000000 copyr 0000 sun micro  so does anyone know if the 00000 sources to textedit are available id really like to work from the latest source if possible  please reply by email and ill post a summary if theres enough  interest   matt landauwaiting for a flash of enlightenment  mattcenterlinecom  in all this blood and thunder  
   i have noticed in framemaker 00x on both the sgi and sun platforms that certain dialogs such as column layout for example respond to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is not in the dialog window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is pointer  how is this done  i would like to emulate this behavior in my application it seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus  alternatively im open to any suggestions as to what is the right way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear particularly when they are invoked from the keyboard and ones keyboard focus policy is pointer  allen barnett whose wife graciously allowed to use her account  
  im writing an application running under x using motif and i need to do some stuff when the application quits  now when i shut down my x windows session it doesnt seem to send a sigterm or whatever signal to my application im trapping various signals like that  therefore i thought i could use an x signal to check for my top level window being destroyed  however i seem to get destroynotify events whenever i move windows  is there any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed some field to check or some combination of events  replies by email please and i will summarise  thanks for any help                       ian                                   iancompsciliverpoolacuk

   a motif 000 application will periodically hang when run against the  openwindows 0 server xnews  i have seen the same problem using a sparcstation 00 solaris 00 ow 00 in my case it happens far more often than periodically  i dont know if theres a corresponding patch for solaris 00 but this sounds like the following bug which is supposedly fixed in 00000000 the solaris 0x olwm jumbo patch  0000000  window system can hang in an errant pointer grab  actually i suspect that the ow 00 problem may be different since the readme file says that this patch is just a sunos 0x version of the ow 00 olwm but maybe that line came from an earlier version of the patch and they forgot to take it out in the 00 version   barry margolin system manager thinking machines corp  barmarthinkcom          uunetharvardthinkbarmar

  i created a pixmap or drawable window then used xdrawline function  to draw a clipped line   000  i created the pixmap or drawable window only with size 000x000 but i draw line from p0x0000y0000 to p0x0000y0000 my question is dose the xdrawline function can finger out that correct p0x0 and y0 for me if you calculate x0 and y0   if youre asking does the x server perform clipping correctly when drawing lines the answer is yes  
  i would like to keep track of x development on  aux  ultrix  openwindows currently i cannot use the newsgroup compwindowsx  and would like to use the email based info  thanks   folkert boonstra    cap gemini innovationdutch research centre  burgelsenlaan 000phone00 00 0000 000  po box 0000fax00 00 0000 000  0000 ga rijswijk nlemailboonstracapintsuucp

  im working on an x00r0 application and have concerns regarding  standard colormaps  the x00r0 documentation says usually a window manager creates  these colormaps  i wonder what window manager the writer had  in mind  neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps  of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps   however xstdcmap doesnt seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap  when i use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black   so it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid  perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps things would  be wonderful  but not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps  finally the operation of the functions xmugetcolormapallocation  xmustandardcolormap and xmucreatecolormap seem inconsistent  with the section 000 of the x00r0 xlib documentation      according to the section 000 of the x00r0 xlib documentation p 000      for grayscale colormaps only the colormap redmax redmult and      basepixel members are defined  the other members are ignored       to compute a grayscale pixel value use the following expression              gray  redmult  basepixel 0xffffffff      xmugetcolormapallocation defined in mitlibxmucmapallocc is      used by xmulookupstandardcolormap defined in mitlibxmulookupcmapc     to select redmax greenmax and bluemax values for the      call to xmustandardcolormap  when the rgbgraymap property is      specified xmugetcolormapallocation sets redmax to 00 of the      total number of cells in the gray scale sets greenmax to 00      of the total number and sets bluemax ot 00 of the total number     referring to section 000 one would expect xmugetcolormapallocation      to set redmax to the total number of cells in the gray scale      when the rgbgraymap property is specified xmustandardcolormap      defined in mitlibxmustdcmapc sets redmult greenmult      and bluemult all equal to 0  referring to section 000      one would expect greenmult and bluemult to be ignored      when redmult greenmult and bluemult all equal 0      xmucreatecolormap defined in mitlibxmucrcmapc constructs      a gray map the sum of redmax greenmax and bluemax gives      the maximum gray value  referring to section 000 on would      expect redmax to give the maximum gray value

   im working on an x00r0 application and have concerns regarding   standard colormaps    the x00r0 documentation says usually a window manager creates   these colormaps  i wonder what window manager the writer had   in mind  neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps  standard colormaps were specd with the intention that window managers would make them available this doesnt mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority  the esge server we ship makes the xargbbestmap available at startup it doesnt wait for window managers to do it   of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps    however xstdcmap doesnt seem to try very hard to avoid   conflicts with the default colormap  when i use standard   colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black    so it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very   problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid  perhaps   if every application used standard colormaps things would   be wonderful  but not many applications seem to use   standard colormaps  does your hardware have only one clut since standard colormaps typically devour all 000 entries there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one clut  i dont believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap rather colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap an example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use xargbbestmap or whatever its called under x00r0  if you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap if you cant do that then youll get flashing on a one hw clut framebuffer  now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client this flashing could also be avoided perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps       paulpmartzdsdescom evans  sutherland

   i am almost done porting xfree00 00 to a new piece of display hardware but have run into a snag i think may be somewhat commonplace so im sending a netfeeler  i have a display that is a noninterlaced memory mapped 0bit 000x000 display  the servers view of the world obtained via xwd  xwud seems to be exactly what it should be  however the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long  after a bit of experimentation it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry but the scanline size in the buffer is 00 bytes which isnt exactly divisible by four  changing the following defines in mitserverincludeservermdh    define bitmapscanlinepad  00 define log0bitmappad0 define log0bytesperscanlinepad0    to    define bitmapscanlinepad  00 define log0bitmappad0 define log0bytesperscanlinepad0    was not exactly the right solution  how do i tell the server either a dont pad the scan lines at all cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display or to pad only to byte boundries  im using a customized version of xfree00v00 under mach 00  thanks brian  
  these are two common subjects so i hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions  0  if my application depends on modifiers what is the best lookup method my choices are to call xgetmodifiermapping for each key press with a  modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table  i would like to do it the second way but i cant seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers  i know that when an app calls xsetmodifiermapping a mappingnotify event is generated nonmaskable which i can pick up and modify my internal table  but i dont seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap  if i use xt all  oreilly has to say is is automatically handled by xt  if i use xlib ala xnextevent i get nothing  this all stems from problems with users of  the sun 00 keyboard and the numlock plus various altmetaetc modifier  requirements  0  i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window  i want it at the same y coord and their rightleft sides touching  what i need to ask for is the xy coord of the window  managers border for the main window  this should ring a bell with anyone who has called xtmovewidget immediately checking the xy after the move and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the xy and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border  any help would be most appreciated  darcy darcymccallummentorgcom  
  i have the following problem on x00r0 servers  when a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the save under attribute set the subwindows of my window are not restored  normally the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window no expose event is sent  when exposuremask is set for the child windows those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws  everything works fine with x00r0  is this something that is changed between x00r0 and x00r0 obvious is it something i do wrong is there something that the popup window should do which is also mine is this a bug in x00 release 0  greetings    hans bos                        domain  hansxelionnl xelion bv                          uucp    sun0nlxelionhans postbus 00                         phone   00 00 000000

  x window installation on a sun0000 with cg0 alone and with cg0 as screen00 and cg0 as screen00  questions 0  are there any hardware configuration changes on the cg0 andor cg0 devices that need to be made other than pulling out and inserting the cg0 frame buffer in the vme bus  0  the cg0 is called a graphics accelerator as apposed to a frame buffer what is the significance of this to the x server and how do we install the sunos driver  x to be compatable   i would appreciate any information on this  i am posting this on the behalf of dr john charlton who does not have net access please reply to him directly at charltonbmeuncedu or just send it at this address and i will forward it   thank you for your help  anay panvalkacsuncedu

  we have a sun 000 and we have just acquired a cg0 frame buffer card  the cg0 is supposed to support both a 00bit color visual and a monochrome visual the default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome and we are unable to change it to the 00bit visual we have tried using xgetvisualinfo to get a visual of depth 00 but had no success  xdpyinfo gives no information about a 00bit deep visual only monochrome   there are two possible solutions if someone has patches for x00r0 xsun server could they forward them to us  otherwise could someone instruct us how to access the 00bit color in openwindows   jon herlockeremail  herlocklclarkedu lewis  clark college portland or 00000

   weve just recently upgraded our x00 to r0 and are now running into problems with some of our applications that use motif 00  it appears that pointer to the widget being passed to the callback function ie the w of w client call  is nil  the client and call pointers are okay in some instances but bogus in other instances  we are running sunos 000 on a sun 0  after compiling x00r0 and all 00 patches with the motifbc flag set we recompiled motif and then we  recompiled the application  did we skip a step or leave something out  is there a flag that we should have used  should we have left motif alone  any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated  thanks kathy   kathy saint               shes a witch shes a witch im not dead yet       how can you tell shes a witch                           she looks like one saintmitchellhaccom         monthy python  the holy grail  
   in article 0qtk00rn0picassocsscsydtansucomau gpatapisboydtansucomau writes  what sort of traffic is generated with the xcalls  i am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running dvx is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response time  anyone have any ideas     i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network itself to give you a realworld example here at quarterdeck we have roughly 000 people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell file servers and each other its not too much of a load on our ethernet with maybe 0 concentrators so you have 0000 people on each segment if you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns  but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a 000 00 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have 00 people running programs off it youre going to see some slowdowns because youre now on effectively a 00 mhz 000 of course dvx will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have 00 working programs running youll know it   well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the  significant drop in price year after year  the link i want to use  though isdn 00k is costly and the bandwidth limited  thats why my interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic  goes through it   having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing you could probably run 0000 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth  hmmm  has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all  are you running any standard mswindows programs like word   what sort of  packets go blazing through what size link do you have 0mb or 00mb  what is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you have few high peaks and then many low points   it all really depends on what the programs are doing ie youre going to see a slowdown from xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also    what do you mean by network things  i vision using ms windows and other windows applications over the network were the processes are running on the server and all i am getting are the displays  i am wondering how  good is the x and subsequently dvx protocol in transferring these  images with xcalls and displaying them on a clients machine          quarterdeck office systems  internet support  tom bortels  pricingordering  infoqdeckcom    tech questions  supportqdeckcom   bbs 000 0000000  fax 000 0000000  compuserve go quarterdeck    qfax 000 0000000 from touchtone phone for technotes on demand        george patapis pan metron ariston     telecom cssc lane coveemailgpatapiscsscsydtansucomau     pobox a000 sydney south fax  00 000 0 000     nsw 0000 australiavoice00 000 0 000

  hi there  i posted this to compwindowsxintrinsics but got no response so im posting here  im wanting to connect a digitiser made for pcs into my workstation an hp 000 it is my understanding the x windows can understand a variety of input devices including digitiser tablets  however this digitiser makes use of the serial port so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver  the hp manual pages say that the hp x server will accept x input from devices listed in the usrlibx00xdevices file   display number i shouldnt think i would be able to simply insert devrs000c as an input device in this file and expect a digitiser to work  but maybe im wrong  am i  what i would like to know is does anybody out there have a digitiser connected to their workstation for use as a pointer for x rather than just as input to a specific x application  if so what were the steps required for installation did you need a special device driver  did the manufacturer supply it  are there generic public domain device drivers around  i understand that digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats  any help would be greatly appreciated  cheers  vaughan    vaughan clarkson                      email vaughanewddstogovau engineering phd student                                phone 0000000000  glider pilot                           fax 0000000000

   hi ppl  i am running xfree000 under linux sls00 and am trying to get the german keyboard working i have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just fine i have found out that there is a preconfigured german keymap for x called xmodmapgr in usrlibx00 so i ran xmodmap usrlibx00xmodmapgr my first impression was very good i was able to get z and y straight  theres still a little problem i cant solve however i cannot get at the backslash bar brackets and curly brackets the altgr key doesnt seem to work i tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does looking up its keycode 000 in the xmodmap i found the entry modeswitch which doesnt ring any bell the entries for the keys i cannot use seem to be correct example keycode xx  ssharp questn backslash the first 0 entries i can even get at the first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift but what is the 0rd my guess is that it should be the key with altgr but it isnt if anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them help would be appreciated  cu  alaric

  i have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes and collects data from that nodes periodically i need to display this data on my x application i tried to invoke this server using xtaddapptimeout which works ok but the problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data so i doesnt returns to eventloop during that time and my application remains busy and it doesnt respond to users input i button press events are queued and exected after server finished its task now i am going to try appaddinput call so that it reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe  i am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client which is my x application will read now i have some doubts which you may be able to clarify  0 when i fork a process it will create to copy of my process right     now what does this two copies mean two shells where should i fork    my application what are the responsibilities of this processes how    should i call this processes  0 can i fork more than one processes so that i can read from more    than one servers input  thanks  samir patel    spatelcstamuedu

  shermanleacscncsuedu chris sherman gripes  it really bums me out that xv went shareware  xvs been shareware for about a year  hadnt you noticed i dont have a problem with this  john bradley has put a hell of a lot of work into xv and if he feels that its time to get some monetary reward from it thats surely his right   can the author legally sell xv  xv uses tiff and jpeg code developed  by others  did the author get permission to sell these works  had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the ijg jpeg code which are right there in the xv distribution you would have observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware and commercial software  sam lefflers libtiff copyright also grants permission for unrestricted use including resale   my guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author  maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product  commercial  theres a big difference between a polite request for a voluntary donation and commercial itsillegaltocopythis andwellsicourlawyersonyou software  i do agree that johns readme file could be a little clearer about what he means by personal use  regards tom lane organizer independent jpeg group  
  i am in the process of modifying an x application that uses xlib  id like to include a timerdriven facility for network polling  you have to do the same sorts of things that xt does with its main loop that is you have to rig up a timer queue and you have to put a  select0 or poll0 call in your main loop  you can obtain the  file descriptor of the x display connection using      fd  connectionnumber display  the functionality of the main loop dispatcher in xt is quite useful the good news is you can get the source and plagiarize

  how can i capture buttonpressbuttonrelease events in multiple clients i want to know if the user is still at the display before locking the screen i can get  keypresskeyrelease and pointer motion events but if the user is pressing the mouse button in the same location the mouse doesnt move i cant capture the events    the oreilly xlib programming manual vol 0 says on page 000    only one client can select button events on any one window at one time      due to the grab that automatically takes place    any help would be appreciated  deryl steinert dusornlgov

  i am having the problem of ensuring pointtofocus when the mouse cursor enters a window in my application  im using interviews but that may not matter this seems to be a generic problem in x for example i use openwindows on a sparc0 with pointtofocus set and that generally works but not always depending on what was going on in some window when i move the cursor from one shell tool window to another  or so it seems  my question then is what can i do within x to guarantee pointto focus within my application  thanks for any response  dave

  repost  i have two questions well probably more about how expose  configure events are handled  i have an appl which uses 0 window to draw in  since i give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized i made a translation table for the expose  configure events the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event calls my rescale method  the rescale method invokes a fake expose event actually just calls the redraw w an appropriate expose struct to draw the data  quest 0 when the appl is compiledlinked w r0 running in either r0 or r0 env i get multiple 0 redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed  i assume im getting cascading events  is that right any suggestions as to how to handletrap events in a better way  quest 0 when the appl is compiledlinked w r0 i get no expose events whatsoever  do events andor translation tables act differently in r0  thanks in advance       steve kelleyumcp csumiacscaptain i protest skelleyumiacsumdedui am not a merry man  worf

  one way to mask the left button check the contents of the xevent that the xaddeventhandler send to your eventhandling function in your case it is the showmouseposition function   if the xevent arrive in this function as   xevent pevent  then the value of peventxbuttonbutton is the button that was pressed so  you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them in case it was not clear peventxeventbutton is an int   by the way you mentioned the button0motionmask and if anyone can help me with  these motionmasks i would be grateful i can not figure out how do distinguish between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring in  essence i would like an seperate eventhandler for motion with each button  unfortunately the xevent sent by a motionmask does not seem to contain the  value of the pressed button  any ideas eps

  hello  the title just about says it all  i need a list of the bugs for motif 00  thanks neal   
  i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif but im hoping is really just a mistake on my part  does anyone know anything about this problem   i am using an xmtextfield and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded   text string ascii or kanji either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring   the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed the text is getting   truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables   lang more specifically lcall  when they are set to japanese   the text gets truncated  when they are set to english everything   works fine  i am taking the default for xmncolumns   please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual    application just in my sample code to make things easier   i am running motif 00 x00r0 via hpux000  my test program is set up   to handle 00 bit kanji characters  i have remembered to do      xtsetlanguageproc prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources   are set to japanese fonts   dont know if this matters but my dialog box and textfield is initially   created with uil    the problem does not happen with xmtext  unfortunately substituting xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative way too much code to be modified while in beta  i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it  my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese but since i dont have the source to look at it is just a guess  please let me know if this sounds familiar or if you have a suggestion or if you want the sample program  thanks   susan     swalkerbbncom   0000000000   
     the shell is waiting for the windowmanager to respond to its  positioning request  the windowmanager is not responding because  it thinks the window is already in the right place    exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to  me all information greatly received  this problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows a misfeature of the x protocol and a bug in the xt intrinsics    the intrinsics bug is that it ignores the xy position given in reparentnotify events  olwm is structured in such a way that when a window is popped down the last event the client receives is a reparentnotify event  at this point the intrinsics notion of the shells location is out of date  if a setvalues is done using the same xy position the intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell so it issues a configurewindow request to move it there  however a misfeature of the x protocol is that a configurewindow request that has no effect will generate no configurenotify event  the intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive and times out after wmtimeout has expired  actually things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager but the net result is the same  the solution is for the intrinsics to note the xy positioning information in reparentnotify events  this has been implemented and is available in x00r0 public fix 00  this is xbug 0000 for those of you who are interested in gorier details  smarks    stuart w marksstuartmarksengsuncom window systems technology0000 garcia ave ms 00000 sunsoft incmountain view ca 00000  
  i dont seem to be able to get window positions reliably through the xview xvget function     x  int xvgetmyframe xvx    y  int xvgetmyframe xvy  for example if i set xvx  xvy to 0000 the frame comes up in the correct position with the top left corner the size handle at 0000 xvget returns 0000 as well but later on xvget returns 000 without any intervening xvsetmyframe xv my frame is fitted around a canvas and it turns out by measuring on the screen that 000 is the position of the first pixel in my canvas relative to the frames origin what gives any help most appreciated  derek  ps on a related subject is there any way of querying the window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around frames etc    derek c richardson     tel 0000 000000 x 00000       institute of astronomy  fax 0000 000000               cambridge uk                                          cb0 0ha                 email dcrmailastcamacuk

  i am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on another machine both are hp 0000 model 000s  the image is created using xcreateimage and xgetimage and displayed with xputimage  the image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because the server on the other machine is using a different colormap  i tried saving the colormap pixel and rgb values and on the redisplay performed a table lookup against the new colormap  this didnt work because some rgb combos dont exist in the new colormap  is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values or is there a simpler way to solve this problem  i tried using xinitcolormap but couldnt get that to work either  any help would be appreciated   don lemoine naval surface warfare center dahlgren division dahlgren va 00000 0000000000 dlemoinxobunswcnavymil

   i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif but im hoping  is really just a mistake on my part  does anyone know anything about  this problem     i am using an xmtextfield and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded    text string ascii or kanji either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring    the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed the text is getting    truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables    lang more specifically lcall  when they are set to japanese    the text gets truncated  when they are set to english everything    works fine  i am taking the default for xmncolumns    please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual     application just in my sample code to make things easier     i am running motif 00 x00r0 via hpux000  my test program is set up    to handle 00 bit kanji characters  i have remembered to do       xtsetlanguageproc prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources    are set to japanese fonts     dont know if this matters but my dialog box and textfield is initially    created with uil       the problem does not happen with xmtext  unfortunately substituting  xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable  alternative way too much code to be modified while in beta    i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone  wants it  my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not  properly allocating memory for japanese but since i dont have the  source to look at it is just a guess  the problem was that textfield was improperly walking the string it used the character count instead of the byte count a significan oops  the problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic patch from hp support services  tom mcfarland tommccvhpcom

    if i use xt all   oreilly has to say is is automatically handled by xt  if i use xlib ala xnextevent i get nothing  this all stems from problems with users of   the sun 00 keyboard and the numlock plus various altmetaetc modifier   requirements  thats not all it says  the coverage of modifiers is in chapter 0 of volume four or chap 0 in older athena editions where there is about  00 pages on how to specify translations to capture various combinations of keys or buttons  the xlib route uses xlookupstring and there is a lot of coverage of how that works in volume one  chapter 0  you should read this to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything complicated  adrian nye oreilly and associates

  i just got a bug report and a fix for this exact problem from fisheriscpbellcorecom greg fisher    the most serious problem i have identified has not  been incorporated  this problem occurs when the table widgets  geometrymanager is invoked by a child  this will work correctly if  the table widgets parent complies with the xt protocols  however if  they do not as is the case for some motif widgets and they ignore  xtcwqueryonly then the sizing will be incorrect          in order to see this problem the following events must  happen  0 a child of the table widget must request a new size  0 the table widget must query its parent for a new size having set     xtcwqueryonly  0 the parent must ignore the xtcwqueryonly bit and resize the table     widget  as part of the resize xmptableforgetproposedlayout is     called  this will set twtablecurrentcols and     twtablecurrentrows to zero  0 the table will continue setting up the new size working under the     assumption that it is working with a proposed and not actual     layout  at the end it will call xmptablesaveproposedlayout  this     will save twtablecols and twtablerows and restore their     values from twtablecurrentcols and twtablecurrentrows     however these have already been set to zero  0 since the table widget has already been resized it will not need a     second resize  0 next another widget managed by some ancestor of the table is     resized  this results in the parent of the table requesting the     tables preferred size  since twtablecols and twtablerows are     zero this will return 0x0 as the preferred size  0 the parent is very likely to grant this request resulting in a     loss of the whole table from the display    he isolated the problem a proposed a workaround which seems precisely correct  here is the new implementation of xmptablenewproposedlayout which will be released with the next update in 0 weeks  xmptablec  void xmptablenewproposedlayout tw      xmptablewidget tw      xmptableconsidersamesize       tw      xmptableproposedcolsandrows    tw      xmptablequeryparentforresize   tw      query only no resize              since we only made a query we should still need to continue       however motif is broken so that we actually may already have       been resized  in that case the proposed layout is already       forgotten so we should just quietly exit           if  twtableresizestatus  rsduetorequest               xmptablemakecolsfitquerywidth  tw          xmptablemakerowsfitqueryheight tw          xmptablegetproposedchildsize   tw          xmptablesaveproposedlayout     tw            else the resize has already been done  our proposed layout would       have been forgotten in the process         the xptable the fix is identical except of course for the names  xptablec  void xptablenewproposedlayout  tw      xptablewidget  tw      xptableconsidersamesize       tw      xptableproposedcolsandrows    tw      xptablequeryparentforresize   tw      query only no resize             since we only made a query we should still need to continue       however some manager widgets are broken so that we actually may       already have  been resized  in that case the proposed layout       is already forgotten so we should just quietly exit           if  twtableresizestatus  rsduetorequest               xptablemakecolsfitquerywidth  tw          xptablemakerowsfitqueryheight tw          xptablegetproposedchildsize   tw          xptablesaveproposedlayout     tw            else the resize has already been done  our proposed layout would       have been forgotten in the process          david smythdavidjpldevvaxjplnasagov senior software engineer0000000000 do not use vmail yet cccp x and object guruoffice 000c000 jet propulsion lab ms 0000000 0000 oak grove drive pasadena ca 00000   that sun windows thingy whats it called  you know its really awful  x  motif  thats it  motif yuck

   in article 0000qdeckcom supportqdeckcom technical support writes in article 0qtk00rn0picassocsscsydtansucomau gpatapisboydtansucomau writes  what sort of traffic is generated with the xcalls  i am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running dvx is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response time  anyone have any ideas     i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network itself to give you a realworld example here at quarterdeck we have roughly 000 people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell file servers and each other its not too much of a load on our ethernet with maybe 0 concentrators so you have 0000 people on each segment if you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns  but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a 000 00 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have 00 people running programs off it youre going to see some slowdowns because youre now on effectively a 00 mhz 000 of course dvx will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have 00 working programs running youll know it   well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the  significant drop in price year after year  the link i want to use  though isdn 00k is costly and the bandwidth limited  thats why my interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic  goes through it  since i dont think tom always gets time to read this group ill take the liberty of responding to some of this  if you really want tom to reply you should send mail to supportqdeckcom  a 00k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 00mbps ethernet that we typically run  how restrictive it will be depends on  what you run and how you run it  i would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like smoking clover would make the link  useless for anyone else  on the other hand probably 00 xclocks quietly updating every 00 seconds or so wouldnt impact it too much  in the real world you will be somewhere in between these two extremes  going by the way i personally use x on a daily basis i wouldnt want to have to share that 00k link with more than 00 other people  having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing you could probably run 0000 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth  hmmm  has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all  are you running any standard mswindows programs like word   what sort of  packets go blazing through what size link do you have 0mb or 00mb  what is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you have few high peaks and then many low points  our corporate wan is as unique as any other  the usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave  the only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a 00k link to ireland that they often use to run a dos text based client end of a clientserver database  remotely from the dvx machine behind me since the server end is or was always at this end california it is faster to remotely run the client via desqview x and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server  as i warned you this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a 00k isdn link  running word for windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent lets break it into pieces and look at it  tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from windows calls into x popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic  restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be  does the server that its displaying on have backing store  if so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic if no backing store then what was being covered up  if it was a  solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily  if it was a full color backdrop of ren  stimpy we may have to send it back to the x server bit by bit  dvx will do its level best to only redraw that small area but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be  repainted  assuning a 0000x000 screen with 0 bits per pixel thats 0000000 bits that has to be sent  worst possible case youre looking at about 00 seconds in reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts  that will be tranlatable into higher level x calls    it all really depends on what the programs are doing ie youre going to see a slowdown from xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also    what do you mean by network things  i vision using ms windows and other windows applications over the network were the processes are running on the server and all i am getting are the displays  i am wondering how  good is the x and subsequently dvx protocol in transferring these  images with xcalls and displaying them on a clients machine  x was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network  its  pretty good for this  x programs are best dos text programs are almost as good since we conert them to x easily  something like winx is a hybrid we intercept the calls windows makes to its graphics driver mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to x  the calls windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network  we go to a  lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level xlib calls we can but we are somewhat limited because we only know what windows and its applications tell us      quarterdeck office systems

   why did x designers decide to not associate the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the display it is being drawn on  in x00 the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing requests  that is the servers drawing model was stateless  this caused problems with performance and network traffic so the x00 redesign included the graphic context to codify the drawing state  most application designers who want to draw things in several different colors create a gc for each color during initialization then pass the gc id in each drawing request  for more information see scheifler and gettyss article in the 0000 acm transactions on graphics

    most graphics systems i have seen have drawing routines that also specify  a color for drawing like    drawpointxycolor or drawlinex0y0x0y0color or  fillrectanglex0y0x0y0color     with x i have to do something like   xsetforegroundcurrentcolor  xdrawpointdwxy    why split this into two functions why did x designers decide to not associate  the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the  display it is being drawn on  for flexibility anyway what you say is not really true the color information is associated with a graphicscontext not with a display and the gc is a parameter to the drawing routines  so if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of width 0 you can make 0 gcs for those cases and then simply do  xdrawlinedpywingcredx0y0x0y0 xdrawlinedpywingcbluex0y0x0y0  for this effect  this is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer but also much more efficient and flexible you would not include all the other parameters like line pattern with cap and joinstyle drawmode and so on in every drawing call so why do it for color  btw stay away from xdrawpoint if you dont really need it to draw random points for image transfers there are image routines   oo  o                   brain inside                         o   o                                                 o   o  andre beck abpsoft mehl andrebeckirsinftudresdende  o  oo

   hi ive just installed the new xarchie 000 and it all works fine except  on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the program dont work at all but on the bw terminal it works fine i can set the icon to an xbm file with twmrc but that doesnt give the neato change when busy action other programs with similar actions eg xmail xbiff work fine  the xinterface author george ferguson suggests it might be a problem with the x intrinsics but isnt willing to hack around to fix it himself but i know zero about x programming so i dont think i can find it   does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem  andrew    andrew jaffe                                     ajaffeoddjobuchicagoedu dept of astronomy and astrophysics u chicago 0000 s ellis ave                                000 0000000 chicago il 000000000                           000 0000000 fax  
   i am using xdm on x00r0 with ow0 and xview0 on sun0s and sparcs running   sunos 000  prior to using xdm i used to set path and other environment  variables like manpath helppath arch etc in my login file  with xdm  the login file doesnt get executed and therefore neither the olwm  rootwindow nor my applications know about these variables       you  should  try  having  a  xsession  script in home to do these things  xdm will  start  up  your  process  using  the  system  version usually usrlibx00xdmxsession which should check whether you have your won and change to that if you do  take a copy of the  system  one and edit it        note that this file requires x access to be set   gordon lack  the contents of this message may reflect my personal opinion  they are not intended to reflect those of my employer or anyone else

   our group is interested in using a pixmap format for multicolored iconsbuttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from resource files using pbmplus we can easily move tofrom xpm to our other environments of mswindows and os0 pm  we were wondering if xpm or some other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the x consortium for r0 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by x   along the same subject line is the reason the standard x pixmap is not used because it doesnt have an associated colormap and other attributes or is it more involved just wondering why there arent editors for pixmaps out there for the original format  email replies preferred thanks in advance  john sigler      texas instruments email siglerhp000itgticom standard disclaimers go here  
                 evolution of sco newsgroups and mailing lists                       many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful    information on sco open desktop since 0000

  we are adding a motif wrapper to a family of data display programs  these programs are each written as a main loop with these steps  use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data   otherwise block new data comes quite often  use msgop to check for messages and if true read them   otherwise continue messages are user commands and not often  update the display according to latest data and messages  we typically have several of these running in windows plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run  xt and xm also have a main loop model that we must fit into oreilly vol iv ch 0 discusses adding a filewatcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time  we can openup our existing main loop and call it as a workproc the problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate neither is letting the program freerun because others are hurt  the unix select call lets you block until any of several io are ready we want that for the x main loop except not file io any suggestions or examples most welcome  we run sgi personal iris and indigo systems  morris hirsch aka morrissg00nuscnavymil or 000 000 0000

      these are two common subjects so i hope someone has had to deal with these    specific questions     0  question 0 deleted     0  i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right    of my main window  i want it at the same y coord and their rightleft    sides touching  what i need to ask for is the xy coord of the window     managers border for the main window  this should ring a bell with anyone    who has called xtmovewidget immediately checking the xy after the move    and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the xy    and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border     any help would be most appreciated     darcy    darcymccallummentorgcom  i have done this before but im not sure i used the best approach although i tried several methods  you have to run up the window heirarchy using xquerytree until you get to the root window  now this is not so simple because some window managers slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window so be sure to take that into account for further calculations  calculate the position and widthheight offsets for each window using xgetgeometry  be sure to take the borderwidth into consideration remember a windows borderwidth is on the outside of a window so the windows xywidthheight must be adjusted accordingly  all of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the windowmanager is using  now to place the new window you have to use the same numbers to calculate  where you want to place it because the windowmanager will reparent it on the outside of where you place your window if i remember correctly  disclaimer all of this is from memory and i no longer have the code  but i did get it working under several window managers correctly  feel free to call or email for further info                mcgary    mike d mcgary                voice 000 0000000 intellection                  fax   000 0000000 0000 lbj freeway suite 000   arpa  mcgaryintellectioncom dallas texas 00000           uucp  intellectioncommcgarycsutexasedu  
  i have been using a hds xterminal and really like it what is really powerful is that it can run the x server without running a window manager one can then run a special client x program called a window manager either 0 run  motif or openlook from its own firmware limiting the network traffic  but having no home or 0 run motif or openlook from some home place like a sparc or vms  this is powerful especially since i can exit one window manager without killing windows and then start up another manager some of my vms tools need special metamouse combos that work in one manager and not the other  well the question is    on a sparcstation running openlook does anyone know how to   break apart olwm from the olwmslave program basically i   want to run only the server and go somewhere else to run   the window manager   please respond my email as well as posting because of the large volumes in windowx  thanks      scott moody   000 0000000   there are no answers  just cross references      scottshuksanboeingcom        uunetbcstecshuksanscott  
   three qs  0 is it reliable  i use it all day every day maintaining our ftp site and answering mail via supportqdeckcom and i can honestly say that in the last few months ive never had my machine go down due to any sort of tcpip network manager instability of course ive crashed my machine quite a few times on purpose during beta testing and that sort of thing but the tcpip portion is quite stable  however keep in mind that dvx and the network managers are only going to be as stable as the software they sit on top of so if your underlying network kernel is flakey you cant expect dvx to be terribly stable  0 how does it send the information from a ms windows app over the x00 protocol does it just draw everything as graphics into one window or does it use multiple windows and essentially work more cleverly  it just goes as a window that has graphics drawn into it to vastly oversimplify what goes on we just take the windows graphics api calls and translate them directly to xprotocol unfortunately windows was not really written to be networkaware so sometimes we see a speed penalty when an app does something stupid like sending a big white bitmap to erase something rather than just drawing a white box fortunately that sort of thing is rare  0 if i want to run ms word for example remotely do i have to run a separate copy of ms windows remotely and then start ms word from that or can ms word be started remotely on its own  you need to run ms windows which word then runs inside you could run multiple windows programs within the one winx window and windows has ways to automagically start winapps when you start windows so in practice its not really a major problem i have my system set up so that i can run winx which automatically starts word fullscreen for windows so i never see any part of windows but word           quarterdeck office systems  internet support  tom bortels  pricingordering  infoqdeckcom    tech questions  supportqdeckcom   bbs 000 0000000  fax 000 0000000  compuserve go quarterdeck anonymous ftp qdeckcom 00000000 leave your email address as password

  i recently corrected the resolution on my sparcstation by changing usrlibx00xdmxservers from 0 local usrbinx00x 0 ar0 000 dpi 000 to 0 local usrbinx00x 0 ar0 000 dpi 00  i determined that my 00 0000x000 monitor was 00 dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution  however this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely after some research i believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by family weight slant and pointsize  i believe that x is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it  since i have only 00dpi and 000dpi fonts on my path the results are inaccurate  i do have some speedo fonts but not for the family i am using helvetica  i think this is incorrect  the fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display  this never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres  this is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts  for instance the command  xfd fn bitstreamcharter000  will invoke a 00dpi font despite the fact that this is a speedo font  the command    xfd fn adobecourier000  will invoke a 00dpi font or a 000dpi font depending on my font path despite the fact that x knows my display is 00 dpi and that it can generate an 00dpi font for me  unless i my applications specifies a resolution x appears to pick a stupid default  is this a bug  is it a feature  if so why  is there anything i can do to get around this problem  people have suggested that i lie about my resolution and specify a single font path 00 or 000 not both this would at least make my app consistent but i like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say yup thats an inch  anyone have a set of 00dpi bitmapped fonts i can use  system info sun sparc 0000 w00 mb sunos 000  xdpyinfo version number    000 vendor string    mit x consortium vendor release number    0000 screen 0   dimensions    0000x000 pixels 000x000 millimeters   resolution    00x00 dots per inch  xset q font path   usrlibx00fontsmiscusrlibx00fontsspeedousrlibx00fonts000dpiusrlibx00fonts00dpi   thanks           rbrodersoraclecom       bob brodersen 0000000000 applications architect applications technology group applications division                   oracle corporation redwood shores ca 00000

   hi im new to this group so please bear with me    two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation  of raster files with sunview becoming rapidly obselete ive  finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview  i put together a quick test and ive found that xputimage  is considerably slower factor of 0 on average than the  sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory  pixrects to a canvas this was on a sparc ipx it seems that  0 the x protocol communication is slowing things down or  0 xputimage is inefficientor both my question is what  is the fastest way in x00r0 to dump 0 plane image data to  a window can i take advantage of the fact that the client is  running on the same machine as the server or am i stuck with  xputimage in which case i might as well give up now    all help appreciatedthanks    derek    the fastest way is to use an x server with shared memory extension it uses shared memory if it is a local x server hence images dont have to be duplicated and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension is not available or if its  not the localhost  sriram

  dear netters     could you mail the source code of the book     advanced x window application programming by johnson and reichard      to me      if you need any source code just ask me      thank you very much                                       sincerely                                      zeng qiyong   zengqiyong suny at buffulo  
  given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice i would say that the shareware notice is unenforceable  all you need to do is make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed under the first part of the copyright notice  of course this would be circumventing the authors wishes on the subject but id say if youre not going to pay him no matter what youd be on relatively safe ground with that approach  in fact given the internal contradictions of the copyright notices id guess none of it could ever be enforced but not being a lawyer i cant be positive  regardless the fees hes asking are not excessive and i would encourage anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible  even though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the author it would be reasonable to do so to support his efforts if nothing else   brad    brad daniels  if money cant buy happiness danielsneosoftcom   i guess ill have to rent it i dont work for neosoft and weird al yenkovic dont speak for my employer

with some of the open look ui       features added      yes openwindows 0 will use dps instead of news  news is dead       this means tnt is dead too      xview and olit will be supported but probably not enhanced after the       next release  i dont know if there will be a source release of       xview 00 or not      the cose environment will include at least some of suns deskset       ported to

specification of a graphical user interface gui     a gui determines the look and feel of a system  the shape of     windows buttons and scrollbars how you resize things how you     edit files etc      the open look gui is specified developed and maintained jointly by     sun microsystems and att or usl      see also bibliography   what is openwindows     openwindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the open look     graphical user interface specifications  its compatible with the     x00 window system from mit as well as currently suns news and sunview     so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems     it comes from sun and also with system v release 0 from certain vendors     openwindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews after the     program used to start it and the main executable itself respectively     it should not be called windows or open look or openlook as     these terms are either wrong or apply to something else     a commerical openwindows source licence costs about 0000 for the server     plus about 00000 for deskset and another 00000 for tooltalk     the current versions of openwindows for various platforms are sunos 000 on sun 0 00 solaris 0x sunos 00x on sparc 00 solaris 00 sunos 0 on sparc 000      see also mixing x00 and openwindows where can i get it   what are olit xview and tnt     these are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs     that conform to the open look specifications  see the bibliography     for documentation on the individual toolkits  heres a brief summary      olit was atts open look intrinsics toolkit for the x window system     it used a widget set and was probably the easiest for people who were     already x00xt programmers to learn  you could buy the source from att     although you didnt get the same version tht sun ship  sun includes the     olit library in openwindows qv it is also often included in     system v release 0  it was written in c  the release of olit in     openwindows 00 was olit 00  olit support passed to usl then a     division of att now owned by novell who replaced it with moolit qv     note that because of the nature of xt subclassing you will probably     want or need olit source in order to develop a large application or     anything else that uses subclasses     see the proceedings of the 0000 x technical conference      xview is suns toolkit for x00 written in c  xview is similar in     programmer interface to sunview  theres even a shell script to help     migrate source code from sunview to xview xview is often said to be     the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with x windows     the xview toolkit is included in openwindows and full source is     available by anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu and elsewhere     the current version of xview from sun is 00     despite rumours to the contrary  some even from within sun  the     xview toolkit is not about to be dropped by sun  xview will be     included in the next release of openwindows unlike news     on the other hand the xview toolkit is not likely to receive as much     attention from sun in the future as olit      the news toolkit tnt was an objectoriented programming system based     on the postscript language and news  tnt implements many of the     open look interface components required to build the user interface of     an application  its currently included in openwindows      the current version of tnt from sun is 00 release 0 contains some     incompatibilities with tnt 00 and tnt 00 but sun are committed to     supporting the api at least until they stop news support some time     later this year and replace it with display postscript  wail     you might ask what is committed to means in this context the     answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing     sun currently asserts that it is committed to olit however      the c user interface toolkit uit consists of an objectoriented c     class library layered on top of xview and a tool to generate code from     devguide 0 gil files  the uit also includes features that simplify     event management and the use of postscript and color  it is said to be     compatible with openwindows v0 and v0 and presumably v000 since the     release mentions that it works on solaris 0     uit is not an official sunsupported product but an ongoing project of     various people within sun  it can be found on exportlcsmitedu in     the mit contrib directory as uitv0tarz use binary mode   where does motif fit in     it doesnt   motif is an alternative graphical user interface that     is being developed by osfit has a look and feel reminiscent of     microsoft windows and the os0 presentation manager  there are no non     commercial motif toolkits available although the motif source is sold     reasonably cheaply by osfalthough motif is currently available on     more platforms than openwindows the open look gui is almost certainly     used on many more machines simply because sun and sysvr0 have such a     large installed base     suns cdware volume 0 contains a roadmap for improving motif     applications by converting them to olit  there are also notes in     the periodic table olit demo openwinhomedemoolittable   what is moolit     moolit is a version of olit from attusl that lets users choose between     a motif and an open look ui feel at runtime  it will be part of system v     release 00     contact joanne newbauer jouslcom 000 0000000   what about that display postscript thing     sun and adobe have agreed that sun will include the dps extension to x     in the next release of openwindows  dps is essentially a badly designed     hack on top of a slow level 0 postscript interpreter intended to give a     very small subset of the functionality of news whilst simultaneously     being harder to use as i understand it  the only real advantage it     has over news is that the manual is much smaller being generally less     complete dps is also available on more kinds of machine     performance on our rs0000 is not suitable for interactive work     what it will be like on the sparcstation remains to be seen     note that whereas xnews fonts are shared by both subsystems the dps     extension to x does not make type 0 postscript fonts available to     ordinary x00 programs  it is not like atm on a pc in this regard     there is at least one thirdparty version which does make fonts     available however    what are olwm and olvwm     they are window managers  a window manager is the part of the x window     system eg x00 that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows     on the screen and for managing the users interaction with the windows      olwm is the standard open look window manager     its included with all of the openwindows qv implementations and     you can also get the source by ftp since sun donated it      olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a virtual desktop hence the     v in its name  it shows a little map on the screen with the     currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle you can     move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys  this     lets you run several clients applications and move the display around     from one to the other  olvwm was derived from the openwindows 00 olwm     by scott oaks you need to have xview 00 to compile it     get olvwm from an ftp site such as exportlcsmitedu in the contrib     directory there are three patches   can i use my favorite window manager with openwindows instead of olwm     yes  if you use twm for example or mwm you wont be able to use     the pin and unpin feature of olwm and you probably wont see the     footers some windows use to display certain messages      if you use twm youll want to use the fdelete function to unpin menus     and get rid of programs that dont have a quit button when not run     under olwm     for twm put this in your hometwmrc lefttitlebutton target  fdelete     where target is a 00x00 icon from usrincludex00bitmaps     alternatively try  add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm lefttitlebutton menu  fmenu olmenu  menu olmenu      quit         fdelete       for mwm you can doubleclick on the menu icon on the left of the title     bar to dismiss a popup window i am told      see the manual page for your window manager twm etc    can i use olwm and olvwm without openwindows or on an x terminal     the openwindows xnews server combines sunview news postscript and x00     this means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems     unfortunately it means that some openwindows programs need either news     or sunview support and thus wont run on an x terminal  this includes     pageview in particular      you can use olwm or olvwm see above on an x terminal or a nonopen     windows display and most open look clients eg olit or xview ones     will work perfectly well  you may find that you get complaints about     fonts not being found  if so see the fonts section below     if you are running the window manager builtin to an ncd terminal you     may have problems with input focus setting input true in the terminals     xdefault file in usrlibx00xdm may or may not help          what configuration files do i need to know about      xinitrc and xsessionrc      the first time you run openwindows a xinitrc file will be created in     your login directory home  if it already exists you might have to     edit it somewhat its simplest to move it and any other old x00 files     you have to another directory and then merge the old and new files      if your site uses xdm you should use xsession instead of xinitrc     since xdm doesnt look at your xinitrc file      openwininit openwinmenu and openwinsys      these are optional files you can create in your home directory     depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use     look in openwinhomelib normally usropenwinlib for these files     without the leading  and copy any you want to change  you may need     to edit your xinitrc to get them recognized  if you are not on an     x terminal you will want to run a console window such as cmdtool c     shelltool c xterm c or chuck muscianos contool program so that     system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen     note that openwinsys is not executed unless you edit xinitrc      xdefaults      you can put x windows resource specifications in here  in particular     it is a good idea to include at least openwindowsfocusleniencetrue input true     these allow nonicccmcompliant programs to receive input even if they     forget to ask for it      props the program that runs when you select properties from the default     root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choices into xdefaults     dont put comments in xdefaults since props deletes them      startupps      this is the news user profile file read by openwindows actually xnews     on startup this is documented in the news programming manual near the     back  the most useful thing to put here is postscript code to change     the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a     syntax error in the postscript means that xnews will either not start up     at all or will get broken in strange waysthe news manual gives code     that is both incorrect and insufficient     warning things in this file rarely work on both openwindows 0 and 0      note that the mouse speed is best set in your xinitrc with xset m see     the man page for xset man xset and xset help for more information      heres what homestartupps  should look like if you want a delay of     about a third of a second 000000 microseconds and a repeat rate of     twenty or so keys per second 00000 microseconds between repeats for     openwindows 0  youll have to experiment a bit because the repeattime     is the delay between keys sent and thus doesnt include the time to     process each key which is probably higher on my 0000 than on your     supersparc 0000 gti injection   again this is for openwindows 0   dont want the demos  see p xxxii of news toolkit reference manual  includedemos false def  userprofile begin     keyrepeatthresh 0 000000 timeval storetimeval def     keyrepeattime 0 00000 timeval

beginpackage tnt 0 0 findpackage beginpackage  classrepeatkeys pop force repeatps to autoload  endpackage endpackage endpackage      if you change these parameters you can test them without restarting the     openwindows server like this  psh i startupps welcome to x00news version0  psh i welcome to x00news version0 classinit classrepeatkeys send  now press controld      you can also either of these two files startupps and userps to make     the root window be retained so that a postscript drawing on the     background wont be erased when you move windows frambuffer retained true put     will do this  note that this may increase the amount of memory used     by the news server xnews dramatically          see also trouble shooting it wont let me type trouble shooting is there an easy way to edit xdefaults environment variables   how can i configure open look for a lefthanded mouse and keyboard     you can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons but be prepared for one     or two occasional surprises  see also man 0 xview for a list of     keybindings you can change at least for xview programs      with openwindows 00 you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings     and then let sunview handle them  the status returned by svenv should     tell you whether your server is running under sunview or not put this     in your xinitrc      if eval svenv env     then xmodmap

but     effective screen saver  see man screenblank     under solaris 0 youll need to copy screenblank from an older system as     its not supplied  then add a new file in etcrc0d to make the system     run screenblank automatically    how do i cut and paste between xterm and openwindows programs      to go from xterm to textedit say      select the text you want to copy by dragging the select mouse button       in xterm      press copy in the xterm this key is l0 or metac the oreilly       xview manual gets this wrong      move to the textedit window and press paste l0 or metav      if this doesnt work see trouble shooting cut and paste     to go the other way from textedit to xterm      select the text in textedit  no need to use copy      move to the xterm window and press adjust the middle mouse button      you can also use the copycut and paste buttons   copypaste is boring what shortcuts are available      quick copy within textedit mailtool etc      click select to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go      press and hold down the paste or cut button      select the text you want to copymove  youll see that its underlined       or crossed out as appropriate  in the jed demo it goes grey      let go of the paste or cut button      the text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret      drag and drop to move a selection      select the text you want to copy or move by dragging or multiple       clicking the select or adjust mouse button      put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection      press and hold down down the select mouse button and move the mouse       pointer a little to the right youll see the cursor changes to be the       first 0 letters of the text or some other icon      still holding select down move the mouse over the point where you want       to drop the text      you may see the mouse pointer change to a riflesight or target to show       that its ok to drop things here      let go of select and the text is movedthis works in text fields of       dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows      drag and drop to copy a selection      this is the same as using drag and drop to move a selection except that       you must hold the control key down as well as the select mouse button   what are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere      see the man page for textedit0 for some of them     in general the editingmoving commands go in the opposite direction when     shifted  eg ctrlw deletes a word and ctrlw deletes the word to the     right of the insert

under either solaris 00 or 00 im not sure which     or not yet in other words      if you have framemaker there is a utility to import them im told     the 00 fonts supplied with openwindows are fully hinted though and     comparing them to the microsoft windows and apple truetype fonts is     interesting  the f0 font format is described in a publication from the     sun openfonts group listed in the bibliography below  documentation on     the unbundled version of typescaler is also available from sun openfonts      you can buy f0 fonts from sunpics monotype linotype urw and probably     other major foundries      sunpics newsprint software supports type 0 fonts   improving font rendering time     although the sun type renderer typescaler is pretty fast its not as     fast as loading

mftobdf from the seetex distribution to convert tex pk fonts to     x00 bdf format which you can then use with either x00 or oenwindows      you can also use der mouses getbdf to get bdf fonts from a

item   cut copy and paste dont work at all openwindows only     oh dear  use ps xuaww  grep xv  to check that svxvselsvc is running     and that either you or root started it depending on whether you started     openwindows with openwin or by logging in through xdm     if not start it  if it dies check that there is no tmpsvxvselsvc     before restarting it  you may need to be root to remove it or you can     reboot your workstation     check that there is space in tmp use df tmp and also see if there     are a lot of files there with names like tmpttytxta00000 if there are     several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it times out      quit any deskset tools such as mailtool filemgr and cm calendar start     a terminal emulator and remove and tmpttytxt and tmptext files     that are still there  its simplest to quit openwin and start it again     after doing that if cut and paste was broken but if it starts working     again you can just carry on  note that files in tmp not owned by you     might be in use by another worker comrade so dont remove those without     checking first       if you get error messages that look like xlib  connection to 00 refused by server xlib  internal error during connection authorization check error cant open display     try on the machine running openwindows or x00 xhost machine     where machine is the computer on which you ran the command that failed     if you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you     using your display you will have to type the bizarrelooking xhost hostname     or xhost happyboy if happyboy is the name of your workstation     this lets any user on happyboy access your display      with openwindows 00 you can also use xauth and the programmers guide      describes how to do this in chapter 0 p 000  this is more secure     also check the man page for fbtab0 to stop other users accessing the     framebuffer directly      also note that there is a sun patch for openwindows 00 under sunos 000     to fix a serious security problem  it is available through your local     sun answer center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftpuunet     00000000 system in

that lets you change or     disable the list of hosts that can access the display      if you start getting this message after youve been logged in overnight     there might be a cron job thats removing the unix sockets in tmp     that are used to communicate with the server when display doesnt have     a hostname before the  or is empty  have the system administrator     change the cron script to skip sockets    i get console error messages on my screen and they dont go away sun 0 or 0     if refresh makes the messages vanish but new ones come along later you need to run xterm c from your xinitrc or start one up in the background and then  choose save workspace from the workspaceutilities menu  better still pick up contool and run that  get it from exportlcsmitedu in the contrib directory  it will monitor the console and open flash its icon or beep when a message appears its very easy to configure      if refresh from the workspaceutilities menu doesnt make the messages     go away a sun with a cg0 frame buffer has two screens  you can move the mouse off the righthand by default edge of the screen and onto a whole new but monochrome display called 00  see the man page for openwin i have a shell script that checks for this and if theres a devcgfour0 does openwin dev devcgfour0 dev devbwtwo0 if you are running x00 or openwindows 0 you might need to add this to your xinitrc or other startup file      eval svenv display unix00 env     olvwm display unix00   later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically you can also run switcher e 0 to get rid of the messages  also see the note about contool above   is there an easy way of editing xdefaults     use props which appears in the default root menu as properties     this starts props a property editor which will rewrite your     xdefaults after removing comments  it then applies any changes     keep comments by using comment instead of  for example commentfont palatinoitalic00   how do i get the file manager to use emacs instead of textedit     set the default editor to sh c exec emacs font lucidasanstypewriter00 file     you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one   how do i run openwindows in inverse video     this tends not to work under openwindows 0 with opwnwindows 00     there are various ways including using bg and fg options  if youre     using openwindows 0 on a sun 0  probably the best you can do short of     upgrading the workstation to a sparc is to use xterm instead of cmdtool   why dont flat checkboxes work     a known bug may make guides output dump core if you use these     a workaround is to edit the guide output as its only guides output     thats broken not the actual checkbox code     this applies only to versions of devguide before devguide 00  if youre     still using an ancient devguide you should upgrade as soon as possible     the new one is fantastic   when i leave openwindows my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays   on the screen     try running clearcolormap if this helps put it as the last line in     the shell script you use to start openwindows eg openwin   when i use snapshot the system crashes or the server hangs or something     this was a bug related to some systems only  the only workround was to     use some other screen dump program such as xwd xv 000 or xgrabsc       why have some of my function keys stopped working     keys f00 and f00 changed from sunf00 and sunf00 to sunxkf00 and sunxkf00     respectively in openwindows 0  applications must be recompiled or you     might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to     change your keyboard layout back again   when i type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit i get the sunview version     see under trouble shooting strange error messages below      see also next item   mixing x00 and openwindows     see also next item      note that openwindows 00 includes the x00r0 core distribution to patch     level 00 but not the contrib directory  these notes apply to     openwindows 00 although you could also the do same sort of thing with     openwindows 00 and x00r0      install the x00 libraries in usrlibx00you can intermix openwindows     and x00r0 or x00r0 theyre all compatible in this respect     put the x00 binaries in for example usrbinx00      put usrbinx00 last in your path so that you get openwindows versions     of programs instead of x00 ones where appropriate although this is a     matter of preference  in any event put the openwindows bin directory     first  see the preceding item for more details on that  if you have     bin or usrbin theyre the same directory on sunos earlier in     your path than openwinhomebinxview youll get sunview programs instead     of openwindows ones      set ldlibrarypath so that usropenwinlib is last after the x00     library directorythis doesnt matter with openwindows 00 but with     older versions youll get error messages from x00 programs if you dont     do this  the messages are generally harmless see next item although     xdm core dumps if this isnt right      set openwinhome to the directory containing openwindows if it isnt     usropenwin      see also environment variables especially xfilesearchpath   i get error messages on my screen about ldso libx00so0 not found     set ldlibrarypath to be usropenwin  if you also use x00 use      usrlibusr0libusropenwinlib     if you put this in a shell script or your profile use     openwinhomeusropenwinlib instead of usropenwin this is for     binsh for csh it is different   i launch my

running openwindows to use answerbookit wont run under     x00 on an x terminal or on anything else because it uses news to draw     the postscript text and pictures     if you are using openwindows 00 you need to use the openwindows 00     compatible navigator its called navigatorow0 on the answerbook cdrom     if all answerbook users are using openwindows 00 you can replace     navigator wih navigatorow0 altogether rename the old one first to     satisfy your sense of paranoia     the navigatorow0 binary is also on cdware vol 0     note that the data files are in postscript so you can

patch   when i run several programs the colors on the screen all change when   i move into a different window colormap flashing          this is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time     however you can minimise the effect with the following procedure       start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve       run cmapcompact save        to create the owcolors file       put the line cmapcompact init        near the start of your startup file xinitrc       exit and then restart the window system       cmapcompact init will push those colors owcolors to the end of the colormap and reserves them      also note that controll0 locks the colors of the current window and     controll0 unlocks them  this is described in the olwm manual page   pageiew uses the wrong colors or makes the colormap flash see above     this problem was reported by people for some reason running the motif     window manager mwm with openwindows     try running pageview like this openwinhomebinreservecolors svmono openwinhomebinpageview openwinhomebinreservecolors discard   xdm breaks things     command tool doesnt like being run without a unix controlling

herenote that there is also a usenet     newsgroup alttoolkitsxview although it doesnt sem to have very     wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles     per monthyou should also look at the faq in compwindowsx   how do i set the font of individual scrolling list items     panellistfont takes an int rownumber and an xvopaque fonthandle     panellistfonts take a null terminated list of xvopaque fonthandles     there is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font     you have to make sure that you always specify panellistfont when you     insert a new row into that list or write a convenience function     insertrowlist row string that hides the nasty bits   how do i keep an xview popup window displayed after a button is pressed     in the button callback do         xvsetbutton panelnotifystatus xverror null     this will keep the window visible     you might also need to investigate the menunotifystatus attribute   how do i make an xview

can the best possible performance from x   windows on your workstation without purchasing more hardware    performance is a highly subjective issue  the individual user must   balance speed versus features in order to come to a personal   decision  therefore this document can be be expected to contain many   subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts    this document is specifically concerned with x  there are of course   many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation   however they are outside the scope of this document       people seriously interested in the whole area of system     performance might want to look at the oreilly nutshell handbook     system performance tuning by mike loukides  imho it contains a     wellwritten comprehensive treatment

maintains the informative and   well written compwindowsx frequently asked questions document   its focus is on general x information while this faq concentrates   on performance    the compwindowsx faq does address the issue of speed but only with   regards to the x server  the gist of that topic seems to be use x00r0 it is faster than r0   please see the x faq for complete details   window managers     there are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different   features and abilities  the choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features  at this   point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager     a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger   is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move   also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   windows                           joe english joetrysteroartcom    ive found that a good font for tiling is 0x00 aka   miscfixedmediumrnormal00000000000c00iso00000  it is   the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun 0000x000 screen   and still get two 00 column terminal windows sidebyside on the   display with no overlap  other font suggestions will be accepted   the x server   which server          make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware   if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x00 server    on my monochrome sun i havent noticed much difference between   the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it was pointed out to   me that xsunmono is about 000k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging             thanks to jonny farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk                         michael salmon michaelsalmoneosericssonse     how your server was compiled can also make a difference  jeff law   lawschirfcsutahedu advises us that on a sun system x should be   compiled with gcc version 0 or with the unbundled sun compiler   you can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not   using the bundled sunos compiler  i assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other highquality commercial   compilers on the market  locking the server into ram                  has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and   does not get paged  eg via a call to plock  does this help   performance at all  ive had one inquiry on this topic and a few   pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone   whos tried it  i am not in a position to give it a try     thanks to eric c claeys eccepermattcom       danny backx dbsunbimbe       juan d martin juandocnmuses  starting your server              joe english joetrysteroartcom      if you start up a lot of clients in your xsession or whatever sleep     for a second or two after launching each one  after i changed my     xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time     we have a heavily loaded system without much core though    this sounds crazy but i have confirmed that it works      warner losh impsolbournecom provided me with a good explanation of   why this works which i have summarized here      when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections  a lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts  this process touches a large number of     pages  any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory  if you     put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up      similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x     client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources     being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so     forth  all this activity is typically memory intensive  once this     initialization is done the process has reached a steady state     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages     by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstations limited resources    this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation as there   are so many variables to be considered available ram local swap   space load average number of users on your system which clients   you are starting etc    currently in my xinitrc i have a situation like sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm      ive experimented with sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm      ive even tried sleep 0 exec startxclientsscript     and then in startxclientsscript i had sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm         the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my xinitrc and had settled down     into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched     all of these yielded fairly comparable results and so i just stuck with   my current setup for its simplicity  you will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you  fonts      loading fonts takes time and ram  if you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use youll get speed increases in loadup time    one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one   large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients  or   at least all your heavily used clients  to use only those few fonts   client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server  this will also conserve server resources since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server        farrell mckay fbmptcburpptcbuozau         joe english joetrysteroartcom     eg my main xterm font is 0x00 so i also have twm set up to use 0x00   in all its menus and icons etc  twms default font is 0x00  since   i dont normally use 0x00 ive eliminated one font from my server    oliver jones ojroadrunnerpictelcom     keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs     if you will make extensive use of r0 scalable fonts use a font server  about the resources file                   keep your xresources  xdefaults file small  saves ram and saves     on server startup time          joe english joetrysteroartcom    one suggestion      in your xdefaults xresources file try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications  for example  reversevideo true      then separate your resources into individual clientspecific     resource files  for example homelibappdefaults  in your     login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath  setenv xuserfilesearchpath homelibappdefaultsn       the compwindowsx frequently asked questions faq contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work     ed      so when xterm launches it loads its resources from     appdefaultsxterm  xdvi finds them in appdefaultsxdvi     and so on and so forth  note that not all clients follow the same     xxxxx resourcefile naming pattern  you can check in your system     appdefaults directory often usrx00r0libx00appdefaults to     find the proper name and then name your personal resource files     with the same name      this is all documented in the xt specification pg 000  000     thanks to kevin samborn sambornmtkgccom          michael urban urbancobrajplnasagov              and mike long mikeleecornelledu      kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers    this method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits       easier to maintain  more usable       fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resourcemanager       property  as a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker since it doesnt have to load all your resources       applications only process their own resources never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them    it also has drawbacks       the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up  this doesnt seem to       make that much of a performance difference and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability  if you are modifying an       applications resource database you just need to rerun the       application without having to xrdb again       xrdb will by default run your xdefaults file through cpp  when       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs they will not       watch out for this        i had c style comments in my xdefaults file which cpp stripped       out  when i switched to this method of distributed resource       files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources  xt did not       provide any error message when it encountered the c style       comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted       processing the resource file        the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy eg ifdef       color  is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management       you may also run into some clients which break the rules  for       example neither emacs 00000 nor xvt 00 will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in xdefaults       when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored your client       will not find its resources  loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources            casey leedom caseygaussllnlgov    a possible compromise suggestion that i have and am planning on trying   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my   xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for   clients that i seldom use  define your display properly                   client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server  in   that situation rather than setting your display environment variable to    hostname00 where hostname is the name of your workstation you   should set your display variable to unix00 or 00  by doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests thanks to patrick j horgan pjh00rasamdahlcom    see the display names section of the x0 man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name    i dont think its stock mit but at least data general and hp have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the display isnt set specially       rob sartin 00opensisartinuunetuunet    jody goldberg jodyalgorithmicscom sent me an xlib patch to change   stock r0 to use local communication even if display is not properly set   i dont want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   nonmit patches and so have elected not to include it here  hopefully mit   will apply this minor 0 lines patch themselves  in the meantime if   you want to try it yourself email jody  ed   clients     if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running  think also   about the kind of programs you are running  for example  is there   a smaller clock program than xclock    unfortunately i havent really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word     suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   eg xclock xterm xbiff are welcome  ed    ive received some contradictory advice from people on the subject   of x client programs  some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly xlib based since xt xaw and other toolkits are rather   large  others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries  in   this case using a nonxt for example client program may actually   increase the amount of ram consumed    the upshot of all this seems to be dont mix toolkits  that is try   and use just athena clients or just xview clients or just motif   clients etc  if you use more than one then youre dragging in   more than one toolkit library    know your environment and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment    thanks to rob sartin

reducing the number of savelines   to reduce memory usage   oliver jones ojroadrunnerpictelcom    jonny farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk   0 xvt    suggested by richard hesketh rlh0ukcacuk     available exportlcsmitedu in contribxvt00tarz     if you dont need all the esoteric features of xterm then get    hold of xvt   it was written here just to save swap space as    xterm is rather a hog      this was written as a partial clone of xterm  you dont have to    rename your resources as xvt pretends to be xterm  in its current    version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm  ive heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature but ive not found any    yet     update march 0000  i recently had a few email conversations with    brian warkentin brianwarkentineengsuncom regarding xvt  he    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm  for    instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling    speed try this quickie benchmark bintime dd ifetctermcap    bs00 and see which program can scroll faster  also while xterm    may be slightly larger in ram requirements we dont have any hard    numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterms paging requirements are not that major     as an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it    made little difference since if you never use it it never gets    brought into memory     so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm  in summary  caveat emptor your mileage may vary    if you can provide some hard data id like to see it    specifically how much ram each occupies how much swap each needs    relative speed of each  0 mterm    suggested by der mouse mouselightningmcrcimmcgilledu

         suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster    from scott barman scottasdcom comes a suggestion regarding motif   text field widgets      i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets i     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes     particularly the initial one in the field  examining the what was     going on with xscope i found it  it seems that when the resource     xmnblinkrate is nonzero and the focus is on a text field widget     or even just a text widget the ibeam cursor will blink     every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the     widget code is making a request to the server copyarea  the user     can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to 0  it is not     noticeable on a 00mhz sparc but it does make a little difference     on a slower system    this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas  consider your heavily used clients are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server   requests   miscellaneous suggestions   pretty pictures           dont use large bitmaps gifs etc as root window backgrounds     the more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc     these take up ram and cpu power  i work on a sun sparc and im     conscious of performance issues i cant comprehend it when i see     people with a 0mb sun 000 running xphoon as their root window      ill let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation     if youre anything like me you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway         thanks to qiang alex zhao azhaocsarizonaedu  for reminding me of this one ed  a quicker mouse           using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse  i use xset m 0 00 in my xinitrc file   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist  see the xset man page for further ideas and information    hint sometimes you may want to slow down your mouse tracking for   fine work  to cover my options i have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window

00          programming thoughts              joe english joetrysteroartcom      to speed up applications that youre developing there are tons of     things you can do  some that stick out       for motif programs dont set xmfontlist resources for individual       buttons labels lists et al use the defaultfontlist or       labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highestlevel manager       widget  again stick to as few fonts as possible       better yet dont use motif at all  its an absolute pig       dont create and destroy widgets on the fly  try to reuse them       this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too       use a line width of 0 in gcs  on some servers this makes a huge       difference       compress and collapse multiple expose events  this can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one    francois staes franskiwiuiaacbe      just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily they suggested trying     out the gnuy malloc but i didnt find the time yet i did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the     differences were indeed very noticeable  somewhat 0 times faster     any confirmation on this from anyone  ed    andre beck andrebeckirsinftudresdende      unnecessary noexpose events      most people use xcopyareaxcopyplane as fastest blit routines but     they forget to reset graphicsexposures in the gc used for the     blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most     cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through its eventloop again and again     thousands of xchangegc requests      this gfx context switching is also seen in most handcoded xapps     where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed     again and again  xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching     and

programs     on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display goal reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server    im not in a situation where i can easily try this but i have received   the following confirmation    michael salmon michaelsalmoneosericssonse     i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big     difference i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion this     helps a lot on my poor little ss0 with only 00 mb it was     essential when i only had 0 mb    casey leedom caseygaussllnlgov      the x00 server and the client are competing for the same cpu as     your server when you run it on the same machine  not really a     major problem except that the x00 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing    timothy h panton thpwesthawkuucp      firstly it relies on the fact that most cpus are mostly idle xs     cpu usage is bursty  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpuintensive at the same time is small if they     are not then you get twice the cpumemory available for your     action      the second factor is that context switches are expensive using 0     cpus halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network typically 00k vs 0k for a pipe allowing     even fewer context switches   other sources of information

  im new to xlib programming im having a problem i hope someone here can help me with i create a window and i want it to have some background color say red and draw an oval in it further when i resize the window i want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window whether it is larger or smaller im using aixwindows on an rs0000  my problem is this when i resize the window only the original part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into everything else is a greythe oval tries to redraw itself but gets clipped i can see that it would be the right size if i could see all of it but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created  for example i start out the window at 000x000 in width and height if i resize it to 000x000 the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 000x000the rest is grey further the oval only shows up in that 000x000 area  what am i doing wrong how can i get a window to resize and redraw a  rescaled image in it to take up the full size of the window  second question could someone tell me what xaw and xmu are  thanks chris

  some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need and it seems that someone out there just might have done it  already  and can point me to some tools that would help what theyd like to do is given a window that is taking a long time to draw because either  the data  is  arriving  over a slow link or the display is across a slow link they would like to first paint a lowresolution version of  the picture  and then repaint it in higher resolution  thus the picture might first be generated in 00 resolution with each  0x0  square  of pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color  next each 0x0 square would be replaced by 0 0x0 squares finally the 0x0 version  would  be painted  since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link the lowres version obviously wouldnt be  transmitted as  a bitmap that wouldnt help at all  instead there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the  lowres  picture  as  a small  bitmap  and  blows up each pixel into a square sorta like the magnifier programs do  this brings up the question of whether the  x server  can help  that is when a window is opened is there a way to ask that a filter program be run to process the pixels  or  is  the only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process permission denied  and have it open a local window  it seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up such  a  program  remotely and then accepts bitmaps compressing each one by some amount and sending them to the remote program to  expand but  if  there is something that x itself can do to help its be nice to hear about it  i looked in several fms  but  if  its  there  i obviously  dont  know  the keywords   if someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all we might want to get a copy  oh yes this is to run on some suns  part of the idea  is  to  build demos  that  can  show such things as if this were run across say a 0000bps link this is how fast the pictures would appear  then  the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for    if the auto industry were like the computer industry a car would  now cost 0 would get 0000 miles to the gallon and at random times would explode killing all its passengers

   ive written an application for sparcstation 0 gx under openwindows 00  the application uses xview stuff to create my window and the sun xgl graphics library for rendering into the canvas  the application does realtime 0d animation but it does not update the the display fast enough im using notifysetitimer xview call to periodically kick off my update routine and its not happening fast enough i want it to update 00 times  second its only doing about 00 also it appears to be compute bound because if i run anything else while my appplication is up the update rate slows down even more  any ideas  thanks

   i have a problem which many of you might have run into  we use lots of  ascii terminals and use them to the max  meaning lots of attributes line  draw etc   now what i need to do is come up with a working xterm which  will emulate our advanced ascii terminals as closely as possible    this means needing all attributes to work including bold and line drawing  the only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in  which one is bold and the other normal while both have linedraw fixed  spacing and several sizes    the only standard fonts which work are the fonts like 0x00 and 0x00b under  misc  they work great except i need a font one size larger 00x00  now  00x00 works well but there is no bold counterpart    to make matters worse i need the fonts in some form i can use for tektronix  xterminals  it seems they like pcf format although i should be able to  convert a bdf format    anyone have any suggestions            mark a davis     lake taylor hospital  norfolk va 0000000000x000      sysadministrator  computer services    marktaylor  marktayloruucp       this would be tedious but if you have the time you could get the bdf file i can email it to you if you dont have it or dont have easy access  to the x source and could make your own bold font from this  since each glyph is just a bitmap you could write a program to convert each glyph to a bitmapreadable file use bitmap to make each glyph bold and convert the results back to bdf format  then use bdftopcf to create the pcf file  then stick the pcf in usrlibx00fontsmisc or wherever and include it in fontsdir and voila youll have what you need    ernie coskrey            000 0000000    ncr corporation  mcpd columbia erniecoskreycolumbiascncrcom           0000 platt springs road                                            west columbia sc 00000 im out there busting my buns every night  tell your old man to drag walton and lanier up and down the court for 00 minutes  roger murdoch copilot

releases readme  xm is a user interface framework for the c language built upon x00 and the xtoolkit it is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets xm was initially created for the motif widget set now support for the athena widgets was added applications created with xm run in both environments without changes although many nice features are only available when using motif in some situations xm extends the underlying toolkit ie providing a combobox borrowed from mswindows but never tries to replace it  data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases  xm has nothing common with motif besides the general idea to encapsulate motif widgets in c objects and the  in its name many ideas for the xm architecture came from digitalks smalltalk version which provides an easy to use framework for windowspmmac applications in the very first time of development i used the windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar smalltalk and xm dialogs   top level objects in xm  windows systemdialogs and toolboxes which use the automatic layout   feature of various composite widgets in motif and xaw  userdialogs which can be individually laid out with a user interface   builder a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this   distribution  controls children of top level objects statictext staticimage pushbutton checkbox radiobutton edit listbox combobox groupbox panearea drawing toolbar  the staticimage and all the button classes can display bw xbitmap format or color gif format pictures as an alternative to a label text  event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects xt callbacks to member functions of xm objects   commoninteractii is built upon the xm drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the commoninteract system research project of our institute in 0000 an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media ie sound alternative input devices if you are interrested look into the june 0000 issue of the joop sigs publications  journal of object oriented programming  there should be our paper about commoninteract but be aware that it is our state of the art from 0000 commoninteractii is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor it currently supports only drawing primitives lines rectangles circles but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also known problem the xm drawing class has no redrawing strategy always redraws the whole window even after minimal changes like selecting an object this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed   about this first release  xm is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems so i think i can call it a beta release which can be used to develop applications for any noncritical purposes commoninteract may be called a pre alpha release its development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications  platforms this release was compiled and tested on   hp0000000 running hpux 000   sun sparc running sunos release 000   pcat000 running linux v000pl0  caution although the whole stuff was initially developed using an att standard c compiler  this release is tested only with gnu g 000 or above the next release will be tested with both

  bernwardmoepidoopende bernward averwald writes  yes dont confuse the mouse cursor with the text cursor in the xterms the latter is only controlled by the application back in the days of x000 i did analyse the xterm code the cursor  was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character i doesnt seem to be changed til now but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via xtappaddtimeout or similar   xtappaddtimeout doesnt work in xterm because despite appearances  to the contrary xterm is not really an xt based application  other sources like timeouts and inputs are never checked in xterms main loop so dont be surprised when you try this and it doesnt work    kaleb

  dplelungtainforescom david levine writes  hey folks im attempting to use imake to manage makefiles for a development effort and was curious to find out if anybody else is experiencing problems with any target that has subdirs generated by imake on solaris 0 platforms   for example make makefiles chokes in the very first subdirectory   ie target subdirmakefiles not found   you dont give the precise error message but i assume that the making of the target fails because make cant find the rules  weve seen this happen with sunos 0x make as well and aat this point im not sure why it happens it seems to happen with large makefiles the entries near the end get lost small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem as it does in your example  in the mit r0 distribution  r0sunos0patch this can happen with the target makefiles in one of the doc directories  at first i thought this was a bug with make on my sun but i built and used gnumake with the same results attached youll find the first makefiles target rule from the generated makefile  this is really weird are your really sure that you were using gnu make  casper

  as quoted from 0000may000000000000moepidoopende by bernwardmoepidoopende bernward averwald   back in the days of x000 i did analyse the xterm code the cursor   was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character i doesnt  seem to be changed til now  but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via  xtappaddtimeout or similar   the server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous though see also desqviewx which does this in its dos windows  do you really want xterm to wake up every half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt  brandon  
   after looking at the scaling code i realized the follwing    0 my problem with the resolution 000x000 foints is due to an installation       problem    0 that the x server or font server will rescale the best font it can find      to meet your requirements         this means that if you server return a response like the following       adobehelveticamediumonormal000000p0iso00000       you can ask for the follwogin          adobehelveticamediumonormal000000000p0iso00000        and it will generate it for you  you should try to always use       known pixel sizes    bill jones     
  thanks to everyone who mailed help unfortunately the end problem was a really stupid oversight on my behalf the code was 000 perfect but it might help to add controlc to my makefile  anyway the mangled name was telling me it couldnt locate the control constructor  i just want to reaffirm what a valuable book this one is im enjoying evry page   
      im posting this request again since the last one had no title     im looking for x server software on dos or windows     ive already seen desqviewx and xvision but would like to be aware  of other solutions namely public domain or shareware implementations     id also like to know in the commercial case about possible problems  incompatibilities available window managers and libraries etc     if you have any experiences in this area please let me know      c u     bye       mario valente      try linux available on the internet

   i understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets                         callbacks and actions  the problem i face now is that i have a quite long piece of application code that performs a lot of drawing into a window i want to connect this to a widget no problem so far i could use a callback function or an action to do this processing any events afterwards  but because the drawing takes some while i want the application code sequence to be able to be interrupted by events then i want to handle the events and resume with processing the application code at the point it was interrupted it seems to me that this isnt possible but how can i give the user the impression that his inputs are immediately processed   has anybody an idea  please answer via email  thanks in advance  soenke   soenke voss                                                faculty of economics soenkewiwi00unibielefeldde                          university of bielefeld                                                              w0000 bielefeld 0                                                                         germany  the only difference between me and a madman is that i am not mad  salvador dali

  excerpts from netnewscompwindowsx 00may00 re colors and x windows a john cwiklamorrisonwri 0000    the problem is that we need solutions for applications now  and although   i would love to have most of the things mentioned here somebody has to write   it   what id like to see is this scenario   each widget view whatever describes its colors via a palette  palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information  they are not directly tied to the object that uses them  palettes are held in the server  a palette can accomadate up to the number of hardware color cells of color descriptors   when the input focus is in a particular widget that widget has access to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette  all other widgets transiently get the closest approximation that can be generated by a union of the colors from the current palette and any free colors that are left over   a widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index pixel into its associated palette   the bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server

      i understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets                           callbacks and actions    the problem i face now is that i have a quite long piece of application code  that performs a lot of drawing into a window i want to connect this to a  widget no problem so far i could use a callback function or an action to do this processing any events afterwards    but because the drawing takes some while i want the application code sequence  to be able to be interrupted by events then i want to handle the events  and resume with processing the application code at the point it was  interrupted  it seems to me that this isnt possible but how can i give the user the  impression that his inputs are immediately processed    use a workproc  see xtappaddworkproc0xt  you should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks this is the hard part  then in the callback that starts the drawing you call xtappaddworkproc to call your workproc the first time  your workproc should be a function that returns a boolean true when you are finished and false when you want to keep processing  if you return false the workproc is automatically reinstalled    note that this method is better that using a timeout loop since events get processed in a more precedenceoriented manner  if you are using the same ada bindings i am however you are hosed and should look into xtappaddtimeout0xt   joe hildebrand hildjjfuentezcom software engineer fuentez systems concepts 0000000000  standard disclaimers apply

  hi netters  we have a problem with makedepend it doesnt know how to correctly process if clause in c preprocessor statements it evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are for example makedepend chokes on one of x00 include files as distributed by sun  namely xosh  if     definedsunos00  definedstdc        include stringh        define  index   strchr        define  rindex  strrchr else    bsd  stdc         include stringsh endif   sunos00  stdc   here makedepend evaluates both if and corresponding else statements to true and tries to open the file stringsh which doesnt exist under solaris0 we also have a lot of if statements in some of our legacy code we got and built makedepend off the net  it didnt fix the problem  in all fairness it should be noted that makdepend manpage suns distribution mentions this problem  bugs      if you do not have  the  source  for  cpp  the  berkeley  c      preprocessor then makedepend will be compiled in such a way      that all if directives will evaluate to  true  regardless      of  their  actual  value  this may cause the wrong include      directives to be evaluated  makedepend should  simply  have      its own parser written for if expressions  has anybody come up with some solutionfix to makdepend other than writeyourownparser and willing to share it with us  since we often experience delays in our newsfeed  please reply  directly to my email address  ill post a summary  thanks in advance       michael turok                                                         information resources inc        email  mltbluesinforescom           000 fifth avenue                voice  000 000 0000 ext0000       waltham ma 00000 usa             fax    000 000 0000

  i have an application that wants to walk the server window hierarchy looking for a window with a specific property   i think what happens is that xquerytree gives me an array of n children but by the time i get to the nth child window it has been destroyed  then i get a badwindow error and my application exits  how can i make this robust  ive thought of the following   0      set up an x error handler that longjmps back to where i         made the offending call  is this safe  do i have to         longjmp or can i just return  badwindow is an x protocol error  if you write a custom error handler which does not do exit0 the error handler will return and let your program carry on  so using a xseterrorhandler is the way to go but never mind the longjmp   0      register for destroynotify on all the windows returned from         xquerytree    too hard

   help  ive got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across the top a toolbar  i wanted to add eventhandlers to these pushbuttons on enterwindowmask and leavewindowmask so that i can put up some descriptive text about the function of each pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it  ive done this fine but ive turned up the following problem  when the pushbuttons are sensitive i get callbacks on both of the above events but when they are not sensitive i only get callbacks on leavewindow events  this seems odd  i would expect this to be an allornothing type of thing  is this a bug  if not can someone explain this behavior  thanks  mark

permission for personal education or nonprofit use is  xgranted provided this this copyright and notice are included in its entirety  xand remains unaltered  all other uses must receive prior permission in writing  xfrom both landon curt noll and larry bassel x xabout this file x x    this file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to x    the international obfuscated c code contest ioccc for short x x    this is not the ioccc rules though it does contain comments about x    them  the guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions x    entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are x    allowed  even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines x x    you should read the current ioccc rules prior to submitting entries x    the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines x x xwhat is new in 0000 x x    the entry format is better for us anyway  the program mkentryc x    has been updated  see entry format x x    we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c x    compiler  certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers  x    fits are no longer permitted  some of the new issues deal with  x    nonintegral array types variable number of arguments c preprocessor  x    directives and the exit function  see our likes and dislikes x x xhints and suggestions x x    you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests  see x    for more information for details on how to get previous winners x x    keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries x    may not be valid entries this year  what was unique and novel one year x    might be old the next year x x    an entry is usually examined in a number of ways  we typically apply x    a number of tests to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi trigraphs to ascii x c preprocess the source ignoring include lines x c preprocess the source ignoring define and include lines x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x    you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x    you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x    cleaned up by the c preprocessor and a c beautifier x x    your entry need not do well under all or in most tests  in certain x    cases a test is not important  entries that compete for the x    strangestmost creative source layout need not do as well as x    others in terms of their algorithm  on the other hand given x    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that x    does something interesting when you run it x x    we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules  as such we leave x    the contest open for creative rule interpretation  as in real life x    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x    is important  for this reason we often award worst abuse of the x    rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x    if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know x    in the remarks section  please note that an invitation to abuse x    is not an invitation to break  we are strict when it comes to the x    0000 byte size limit  also abusing the entry format tends to x    annoy more than amuse x x    we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries x    to attempt to exploit them  we will award worst abuse of the rules x    and then plug the hole next year  even so we will attempt to use x    the smallest plug needed if not smaller   x x    check out your program and be sure that it works  we sometimes make x    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly x    in or near the final round  on the other hand we have seen some x    of the best entries fall down because they didnt work x x    we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that x    00 is a prime number  if you do have a bug you are better off x    documenting it  noting this entry sometimes prints the 0th power x    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry  and sometimes x    a strange bugfeature can even help the entry  of course a correctly x    working entry is best x x xour likes and dislikes x x    doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old  we x    tend to see thru masses of defines due to our preprocessor tests x    that we apply  simply abusing defines or dfoobar wont go as far x    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x x    many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x xdefine d define xd foo    dont expect this to turn into define foo x xint i xj    dont use such implicit type declaration xint k x x    we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler  if you  x    must use nonansi c such as kr c you must avoid areas that result in  x    compilelink errors for ansi c compilers x x    unfortunately ansi c requires array indexes to be of integral type x    thus the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed x xint i xchar c xic    use ci instead xi0string    use stringi0 instead x x    if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x    arguments be careful systems implement valist as a wide variety x    of ways  because of this a number of operations using valist are x    not portable and must not be used x x assigning a nonvalist variable tofrom a valist variable x casting a nonvalist variable intofrom a valist variable x passing a valist variable to a function expecting a nonvalist arg x passing a nonvalist variable to a function expecting a valist arg x performing arithmetic on valist variables x using valist as a structure or union x x    in particular do not treat valist variables as if they were a char s x x    avoid using varargsh use stdargh instead x x    if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef  x    the leading  must be the first character on a line  while some x    c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading  many do not x x    because the exit function returns void on some systems entries x    must not assume that it returns an int x x    small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x    while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do x    serve a useful purpose  they are often the only program that people x    attempt to completely understand  for this reason we look for x    programs that are compact and are instructional x x    one line programs should be short one line programs say around 00 x    bytes long  getting close to 000 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x x    we tend to dislike programs that x x are very hardware specific x are very os or unx version specific x     indexstrchr differences are ok but socketstreams specific x      code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings x     it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x wont compile under both bsd or sys v unx x abusing the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi trigraphs x are longer than they need to be x are similar to previous winners x are identical to previous losers   x x    unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the x    best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x x    the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x    limit  it is one thing to make use of a several ds to help out x    but it is quite another to use 000 bytes of ds in order to x    try and squeeze the source under the size limit  you should feel x    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off x    if you show some amount of restraint x x    we allowed whitespace and in certain cases   or  do not impact x    your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x x    given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob x    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x    program we tend to favor the second version  of course a third x    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x    andor obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x x    we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest selfreplicating x    program  we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x    to be the smallest  there is nothing wrong with selfreplicating x    programs  in fact a number of winners have been selfreplicating x    you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x    know of a smaller one x x    x client entries should be as portable as possible  entries that x    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored  dont x    depend on a particular type of display  for example dont depend x    on color or a given size  dont require backing store x x    x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x    software that is not in wide spread use  we ask that such x client x    entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x    athena widget set libx00a libxawa libxmua and libxta x    dont use mtif xvew or openlok toolkits since not everyone x    has them  avoid depending on a particular window manager  not x    everyone has x00r0 and some people are stuck back in x00r0 or x    earlier so try to target x00r0 without requiring x00r0  better x    yet try to make your entry run on all version 00 x window systems x x    x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x    xdefaults  if you must do so be sure to note the required lines x    in the remark section x x    we like programs that x x are as concise and small as they need to be x do something at least quasiinteresting x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x make us laugh andor throw up   x x    some types of programs cant excel in some areas  of course your x    program doesnt have to excel in all areas but doing well in several x    areas really does help x x    we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in x    the remark section helps your chance of winning  if you had to x    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x    we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x x    be creative x x xentry format x x    in order to help us process the many entries we must request your x    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way  this format x    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the x    author from the program itself  see judging process x x    we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to x    format entries  you should be aware of the following warning that x    is found in mkentryc x xthis program attempts to implement the ioccc rules  every xattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces xan entry that conforms to the contest rules  in all cases xwhere this program differs from the contest rules the xcontest rules will be used  be sure to check with the xcontest rules before submitting an entry x x    you are not required to use mkentry  it is convenient however x    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check x    the entry against the size rules x x    if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about x    the mkentryc program please send email to the judges  see below x x    the following is a sample entry x xentry xrule0000 xfixn

compile into prog  if an entry wins we will rename x    its source and binary to avoid filename collision  by tradition x    we use the name of the entrys title followed by an optional x    digit in case of name conflicts x x    if the above entry somehow won the least likely to win award x    we would use chonglabc and chonglab x x    if your entry depends on or requires that your build source x    andor binary files be a particular name please say so in the x    remark section  if this case applies it would be be helpful x    if you did one of the following x x tell us how to change the filenames in your entry x x have the build file make copies of the files  for example x xcc progc o specialnameneed special binary x x    or  rm f specialsrccneed special source xcp progc specialsrcc xcc specialsrcc o specialname x x    or  rm f specialbuildneed special build xtail 0 build  specialbuild xsh  specialbuild x x assume that we will use the entry title  send us a version of  x  your buildprogram files that uses the name convention  you  x  should uuencode these files in data sections x x    if your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files x    please say so in the remark section  you should try to avoid x    touching your original build source and binary files  you should x    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify  this x    will allow people to regenerate your entry from scratch x x    remember that your entry may be built without a build file  we x    typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile  if the x    build file must exist say so in the remark section x x    if your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them x    into info sections  in the case of multiple info files x    use multiple info sections  if no info files are needed x    then skip the info section x x    info files are intended to be input or detailed information that x    does not fit well into the remark section  for example an x    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample x    programs for the user to compile  an entry might want to include a x    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a x    hints file x x    info files should be used only to supplement your entry  for x    example info files may provide sample input or detailed x    information about your entry  because they are supplemental x    the entry should not require them exist x x    in some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name x    conflicts  if info files should not be renamed for some reason x    say so in the remark section x x    info files must uudecode into the current directory  if they x    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a subdirectory say x    so in the remark section x x    when submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has x    a unique entry number from 0 to 0  your first entry should x    have entry number 0 x x    with the exception of the header all text outside of the entry x    format may be ignored  that is dont place text outside of the x    entry and expect the judges to see it  our decoding tools arent x    ai progs if you need tell the the something put it in the  x    remark section or send a email to the judges at x xapplepyramidsunuunethoptoadjudgesnot the address for xjudgestoadcom submitting entries x     x    the date should be given with respect to utc  some systems refer  x    to this as gmt or gmt0  the format of the date should be that as  x    returned by asctime in the c locale  an example of such a string is x xthr apr 00 000000 0000 x x    this format is similar to the output of the date0 command  the x    string does not include the timezone name before the year  on many  x    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string x xdate u a h d t 00y xdate u  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzutc date  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzgmt date  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzgmt0 date  sed e s 0000000 x x    you are allowed to updatefixrevise your entry  to do so set x    the fix line in the entry section to y instead of n x    be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be x    replaced x x xjudging process x x    entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll x x    entries are unpacked into individual directories  the email message x    is unpacked into individual files each containing x xentry section xall author sections xall info sections xbuild section xprogram section xany other text including the email message headers x x    prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be sure x    it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was x    malformed and did not unpack correctly  information from the x    author sections are not read until the judging process is x    complete and then only from entries that have won an award x x    the above process helps keep us biased foragainst any one particular x    individual  we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x    until the final awards are given  we like the surprise of finding x    out in the end who won and where they were from x x    we attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award x    because the main prize of winning is being announced we make all x    attempts to send nonwinners into oblivion  we remove all nonwinning x    files and shred all related paper  by tradition we do not even x    reveal the number of entries that we received  for the curious x    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x    winners at talks x x    after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to the x    authors of the winning entries  one reason we do this is to give x    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x    entry  they are given the chance to correct mistakes typos  we x    often accept their suggestionscomments about our remarks as well x    this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world x x    judging consists of a number of elimination rounds  during a round x    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles x    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does x    not  we also reexamine the entries that were eliminated in the x    previous round  thus an entry gets at least two readings x x    a reading consists of a number of actions x x reading the entry section x reading the uudecoded build section x reading the uudecoded program section x reading the uudecoded info sections if any x passing the source thru the c preprocessor x    shipping over any include files x performing a number of c beautifycleanup edits on the source x passing the beautified source thru the c preprocessor x    shipping over any include files x x    in later rounds other actions are performed x x linting the source x compilingbuilding the source x running the program x performing misc tests on the source and binary x x    until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 00 entries entries x    are judged on an individual basis  an entry is set aside because it x    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round x    when the number of entries thins to about 00 entries we begin to form x    award categories  entries begin to compete with each other for awards x    an entry often will compete in several categories x x    the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x    we receive  a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x strangestmost creative source layout x most useful obfuscated program x best game that is obfuscated x most creatively obfuscated program x most deceptive c code x best x client see our likes and dislikes x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rules x anything else so strange that it deserves an award x x    we do not limit ourselves to this list  for example a few entries are so x    goodbad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x    we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x x    in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of x    reducing the remaining entries typically about 00 down to 0 or 00 x    winners  often we are confident that the entries that make it into x    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x    make it  the selection of the winners out of the final round is x    less clear cut x x    sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out x    by a similar but slightly better entry  for this reason it is x    sometimes worthwhile to reenter an improved version of an entry  x    that failed to win in a previous year  this assumes of course  x    that the entry is worth improving in the first place x x    more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a x    strangecreative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest x    rules in some way x x    in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best  sometimes such x    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry  more often the x    best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x x xannouncement of winners x x    the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference  by tradition x    this is done during the latter part of the uunetioccc bof just prior to x    the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x x    winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups x x    complangc  compunixwizardsaltsources x x    in addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following x x    compsourcesd  altsourcesdmiscmisc x

are classes that provide the base functionality object   rectobj core composite constraint shell overrideshell wmshell   etc  the terms xt and intrinsics are used interchangeably   however they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the x   window system  in particular it does not include the athena   motif olit or any other widget set  without further widgets the   intrinsics are not especially useful  o a widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via xt  the   precise use is any object that is a subclass of the core class  it   is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the   object class although these are more accurately called windowless   widgets or gadgets  o xlib is the c interface to the x00 protocol  it is one layer below   the xt intrinsics  typically a widget uses relatively few xlib   functions because xt provides most such services although an   understanding of xlib helps with problems   0  software versions   the

list for compwindowsxintrinsics it is on export in contribfaqxt   0  why does my application core dump when i use signalsalarmscthreads   in brief xlib xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections  any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state  such as all the appropriate flags not yet set dangling pointers in the middle of a list traversal etc  note that the ansi c standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by xlib or xt functions  the only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler  this flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback  it is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler  as another note it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes  this effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called  another option is to open a pipe tell the event loop about the read end using xtappaddinput and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal however this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up  why dont the intrinsics deal with this problem  primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system   is that a good enough reason  i dont think so          note the article in the x journal 00 and the example in oreilly volume 0 are in error   0  how do i use a different visual than the default   this requires a more complicated answer than it should  a window has three things that are visual specific  the visual colormap and border pixmap  all widgets have their own colormap and borderpixmap resource only shell widgets have visual resources another questions deals with why shells have a visual  the default value of these resources is copyfromparent which does exactly what it says  in the shell widget copyfromparent gets evalulated as defaultvisualofscreen and defaultcolormapofscreen  when any one of the three resources is not properly set a badmatch error occurs when the window is created  they are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used    how to get this to work  there are two parts to the answer  the first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual  the second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available  the first is a little harder because youll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information     some sample code to start up an application using something other   than the default visual     to compile  cc g visualc o visual lxaw lxmu lxt lxext lx00 lm     to run  visual geometry 000x000 depth 00 visual staticcolor fg blue bg yellow     you

xtappmainloop app return 0    0  which visual should an application use   this is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual  it has to be specified by the user  if you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 00bit truecolor with an overlayplane extension or some such  why  no application runs in isolation  depending on the way a server allocates resources i may not always want your application to run in truecolor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications  i may be very upset if it chooses to run in greyscale instead of psuedocolor or just monochrome  as an example on a low end color sun server there are many different possible visuals monochrome 000 entry colormap static gray static color and a 000 truecolor  the sgi iriss offer all the above  plus 00 bit truecolor 00 bit truecolor an overlay plane   0  why do only shell widgets have a visual   this is strictly by convention  it makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell  a widget can have its own visual resource  if it does it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls xcreatewindow  you should also make this a resource that can be obtained with xtgetvalues so other widgets can find it  a reasonable value is probably xtnvisual   0  which visual depth and colormap do shells inherit   the default value for these resources are set to copyfromparent  this is interpreted as the defaultcolormapofscreen defaultdepthofscreen and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent  ie it is an applicationshellwidgetclass and the root of your widget tree  if the parent of the widget is not null then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses copyfromparent as the visual   0  ive done all the above and i still get a badmatch error  why   some resource converters improperly cache references  this was especially true of x00r0 and earlier versions of motif   0  why doesnt my widget get destroyed when i call xtdestroywidget   see section 00 of the xt specification  it eventually does get destroyed just not immediately  the intrinsics destroy a widget in a twophase process  first it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed it is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed  this way any pending x events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed  the second phase is then performed after all callbacks event handlers and actions have completed before checking for the next x event  at this point the list is traversed and each widgets memory is actually freed among other things  as some further caveatstrivia the widgets may be destroyed if the intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list  if so then the phase 0 destruction occurs immediately  also if nested event loops are used widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop   00 how do i exit but still execute the destroycallbacks   the problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used such as calling exit directly then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state  such as open sockets temporary files allocated x resources etc  this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget   widget toplevelget gw widgetgw widget to find toplevel   widgettop  for top  gw xtparent top top  xtparent top  empty  return top   void exitcallback gw closure calldata widgetgw widget  xtpointerclosure data the app specified  xtpointercalldata widget specific data   widgettoplevel  toplevel  toplevelget gw xtunmapwidget toplevel make it disappear quickly  xtdestroywidget toplevel exit 0   one can see that the above code exits immediately after destroying the toplevel widget  the trouble is the phase 0 destruction may never occur    this works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state  you might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget  which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the destroy callbacks  one alternative is to modify exitcallback to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop  however private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy and difficult to maintain practices  try the following code instead  include x00intrinsich  extern widget toplevelget  if needfunctionprototypes widgetgw endif   extern boolean exitworkproc  if needfunctionprototypes xtpointerclosure endif   extern void exitcallback  if needfunctionprototypes widgetgw xtpointerclosure xtpointercalldata endif   widget toplevelget gw widgetgw widget to find toplevel   widgettop  for

boolean exitworkproc closure xtpointerclosure  exit 0 notreached    exitcallback adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle  which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed   00 how do i resize a shell widget   after it is realized one doesnt resize a shell widget  the proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the shell widget using xtsetvalues  the geometry change is then propagated to the shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request  however the shell must have the resource xtnallowshellresize set to true otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the shell will not resize  to change the position of a shell use xtsetvalues on the shell not the child and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted   00 why cant xtappaddinput handle files   it does however unix semantics for when io is ready for a file does not fit most peoples intuitive model  in unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read call would not block ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block  this works as expected for terminals sockets and pipes  for a file the read will always return but the return indicates an eof  ie no more data  the result is the code in the intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read  the culprit is the select system call or on sysv based oss it is the poll system call  how to get around this on a unix system  the best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file  use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to xtappaddinput  a suitable program on bsd systems is tail f filename  its rumored that select on some systems is not completely reliable  in particular   ibm aix 00 this is one where it would work for a while   several thousand times and then stop until some other   event woke it up this seemed to be the result of a race   condition in the kernel  ibm claims to have a fix for this   pyramid doesnt work at all   ultrix and possibly others where pipes are implemented as   sockets wasnt completely broken but although the writing   side wrote in 000 byte blocks the reading side received it   all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at   a time  you can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks   get raound it by detecting the situation and having   select ignore the pipe for 00 mseconds  by then it had   been given the whole block   note that all the above descriptions used unix terminology such as read file descriptor pipes etc  this is an os dependent area and may not be identical on all systems  however the intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit  why they didnt also deal with signals at this point i dont know   00 what good books and magazines are there on xt   i have a favorite that is the definitive reference  to my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the intrinsics  when i started using it i was already familiar with xt and the concepts behind it so newcomers may or may not find it useful  ive always found it accurate and complete which means its a 0000 pages  asente paul j and swick ralph r x window system toolkit the complete programmers guide and specification digital press 0000 isbn 0000000000 order number

volume 0 is an xt reference done in manual page style  the 0rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the mit manual pages  im finding it very useful  in particular the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information  i read two periodicals the x resource and the the x journal these are the only two dealing specifically with x  the x resource is published quarterly by oreilly with one of the issues being the mit x consortium technical conference proceedings  there is no advertising  ive found it informative with pretty

ugly side  recently a 0d look is   available for ftp on exportlcsmiteducontribxaw0dtarz motif from osf available for a license fee and commonly shipped on   many workstation vendors platforms almost everyone but   sun  it looks good and works well but personally i think   it is poorly implemented olit the open look intrinsics toolkit is a set of widgets   implementing suns open look specification

namelanguagevendor  xviewcsun oicparcplace interviewscstanford tcltkcspriteberkeleyedu    however much i like c and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the intrinsics hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 00 years that uses an object oriented language  keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than c starts gaining acceptance   00 how do i pass a float value to xtsetvalues   first what is going wrong is the structure for an arg is essentially typdef struct      stringname     longvalue  arg  and the code argarg  xtsetarg arg name 00  expands to argarg  argname  name argvalue  00  you can see that with normal c type conversions the argvalue gets the integer 0 instead of the floating point value 00  when the value is copied into the widget resource the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value  so how to get around this  the following macro is from the athena widgets document and i am

converters changed between r0 and r0 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values  there are several main types of resource converters      string to data type     data type to string     data type to data type  i string to data type     usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings     that will be converted to data type values  this is most often     used to map enumerated names to enumerated values  namevalue true0 false0      in this case the string to data type converter needs to compare     the resource value to the list of fixed strings  this is most     readily accomplished by the use of the quark mechanism of the     resource manager  the resource value is turned into a quark     which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a     single word  then the resource quark is compared against the     quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values      if there are many enumerated strings in the converter or many     converters each with a small number of enumeration strings then     a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the     resource strings into quarks  that way the first time one of     these converters is used the strings will be turned into quarks     and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one     of the converters  ii data type to string     this type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data     type converters since the use of quarks isnt necessary  instead     the data type value is simply converted to a string value     probably by the use of sprintf      data type to string converters are useful for applications that     wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that     they can write out a valid resource specification to a file  this     mechanism can be used to provide a snapshot of application state     into a file  this snapshot can be used to restore the program to     a known state via the usual x resource database mechanisms      if you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type     converter it isnt much extra effort to write the data type to     string converter  writing both at the same time helps to ensure     that they are consistent  iii data type to data type     this type of converter is used to convert an existing data type     value to another data type  for instance an x pixel value can be     converted to an rgb data type that contains separate fields for     red green and blue   the type signature for a resource converter is as follows  typedef boolean xttypeconverterdisplay  xrmvalueptr cardinal  xrmvalueptr xrmvalueptr xtpointer      display dpy     xrmvalueptr args     cardinal numargs     xrmvalueptr fromval     xrmvalueptr toval     xtpointer converterdata  when the converter is invoked the fromval argument points to the source x resource manager value and the toval argument points to the destination x resource manager value  the converterdata argument is an opaque pointer to some converterspecific data that is specified when the converter is registered  the args and numargs arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked  for instance the pixel to rgb structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the pixel to obtain the rgb values corresponding to that pixel  care must be taken with the toval argument  an xrmvalue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value  typedef struct      unsigned int    size     caddrt         addr  xrmvalue xrmvalueptr  when the converter is invoked the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be null in the former case the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value  if the destination area is not large enough then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return false  the caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter  if the size is large enough then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return true  if the location is null then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return true  when writing a group of converters this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro      define donevar type        if tovaladdr      if tovalsize  sizeoftype              tovalsize  sizeoftype        return false          else      type  tovaladdr  var          else  tovaladdr  caddrt var        tovalsize  sizeoftype        return true      define donestrstr        if tovaladdr  tovalsize  sizeofstring      tovalsize  sizeofstring    return false          else  tovaladdr  caddrt str        tovalsize  sizeofstring        return true  inside the converter it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the numargs and args arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly  once you have written your converter you need to register it with the intrinsics  the intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database  to register a converter with a single application context use xtappsettypeconverter  void xtappsettypeconvertercontext from to converter args numargs cache destructor     xtappcontext context     string from     string to     xttypeconverter converter     xtconvertarglist args     cardinal numargs     xtcachetype cache     xtdestructor destructor  to register a converter with all application contexts use xtsettypeconverter  void xtsettypeconverterfrom to converter args numargs cache destructor     string from     string to     xttypeconverter converter     xtconvertarglist args     cardinal numargs     xtcachetype cache     xtdestructor destructor  in the r0 intrinsics there were the routines xtappaddconverter and xtaddconverter these have been superseded by xtappsettypeconverter and xtsettypeconverter  whenever possible the newer routines should be used  when a converter is registered with the intrinsics a cache argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached      xtcachenonedont cache any converted values     xtcacheallcache all converted values     xtcachebydisplaycache converted values on a per display basis  caching converted values that require a roundtrip to the server is a good idea for instance string to pixel conversions  the destructor argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed  xtdestructor has the following type definition  typedef void xtdestructorxtappcontext xrmvalueptr xtpointer xrmvalueptr cardinal      xtappcontext context     xrmvalueptr to     xtpointer converterdata     xrmvalueptr args     cardinal numargs  the destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the to argument but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the to argument itself toaddr  the destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed for instance colormap and visual arguments for the string to pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated pixel from the colormap as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered  sample converter code can be found in the following files in the mit r0 distribution      mitlibxtconvertersc

complete coverage of the issues involved  most of this answer is based on that article  in a nutshell one uses xtopendisplay to add each display to a single application context and then xtclosedisplay to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context  the real problems occur when trying to close down a display  this can happen 0 ways 0 user selects a quit button on one of the displays 0 user has window manager send a wmdeletewindow message 0 server disconnect  possibly from a killclient message    server shutdowncrash or network failure  ill assume you can deal gracefully with 0  0 since it is merely a problem of translating a widget to a display and removing that display  if not then read the oliver jones article  the third one is difficult to handle  the following is based on the oliver jones article and i include it here because it is a difficult problem  the difficulty arises because the xlib design presumed that an io error is always unrecoverable and so fatal  this is essentially true for a single display x based application but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an x server  when an x io error occurs the io error handler is called and if it returns then an exit happens  the only way around this is to use setjmplongjmp to avoid returning to the io error handler  the following code fragment demonstrates this  include setjmph jmpbuf xiorecover  void xiohandler dpy displaydpy  destroydisplay dpy longjmp xiorecover 0   main    if setjmp xiorecover  0 xsetioerrorhandler xiohandler xtappmainloop appcontext   the destroydisplay is something that given a display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup  it should also call xtclosedisplay  for those of you unfamiliar with setjmplongjmp when setjmp is first called it returns a 0 and saves enough information in the jmpbuf that a latter execution of longjmp can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp was just executed  the return value of this second setjmp is the value of the second argument to longjmp  there are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate  some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources  the most likely symptoms are xlib errors such as badcolor badatom or badfont  there may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 00 being a typical value  you may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display  there was much discussion in compwindowsx about this topic in november of 00  robert scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and xlib will not change   00 what changed from r0 to r0 to r0   this addresses only changes in the intrinsics  first the general changes for each release are described

resources of a widget are filled in from the following places from highest priority to lowest priority  0 args passed at creation time 0 command line arguments 0 users per host defaults file 0 users defaults file 0 users per application default file 0 system wide per application default file  note that 00 are read only once on application startup  the result of steps 00 is a single resource database used for further queries  the per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer  this file is either specified with the xenvironment environment variable or if that is not set then the file homexdefaultshost is used  the user defaults file is either obtained from the resourcemanager property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file homexdefaults is used  typically the program xrdb is used to set the resourcemanager property  please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property  a size of around 00kbyte is reasonable  some toolkits may track changes to the resourcemanager but most do not  a user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application  the intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found  read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found  the system wide per application default files are typically found in usrlibx00appdefaults  if such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used  the intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found  read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found  thanks to oliver jones ojpictelcom for the following 000  you can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your xtbased programs  xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and xapplresdir  these environment variables control where xt looks for applicationdefaults files as an application is initializing  xt loads at most one appdefaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath  set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a way that appdefaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies  suppose for example that you are running suns open windows and you also have some r0 x applications installed in usrlibx00appdefaults you could set a value like this for xfilesearchpath and it would cause xt to look up appdefaults files in both usrlibx00 and usropenwinlib or wherever your openwinhome is located  setenv xfilesearchpath usrlibx00tnopenwinhomelibtn  the value of this environment variable is a colonseparated list of pathnames  the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see xtresolvepathname  nthe value of the filename parameter or the applications class name tthe value of the file type  in this case the literal string appdefaults ccustomization resource r0 only ssuffix  none for appdefaults llanguage locale and codeset eg jajpeuc llanguage part of l  eg ja tthe territory part of the displays language string cthe codeset part of the displays language string  lets take apart the example  suppose the applications class name is myterm also suppose open windows is installed in usropenwin notice the example omits localespecific lookup  usrlibx00tn        means usrlibx00appdefaultsmyterm openwinhomelibtn    means usropenwinlibappdefaultsmyterm  as the application initializes xt tries to open both of the above appdefaults files in the order shown  as soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for others  the effect of this path is to search first in usrlibx00 then in usropenwin  lets consider another example this time lets set xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file mytermad in the current working directory then for myterm in the directory appdefaults  setenv xuserfilesearchpath nadhomeappdefaultsn  the first path in the list expands to mytermad  the second expands to homeappdefaultsmyterm  this is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the imake convention of naming the appdefaults file mytermad in the applications source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly  note when looking for appdefault files with xuserfilesearchpath       for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is       defined so t and s are useless  with r0 theres another twist  you may specify a customization resource value  for example you might run the myterm application like this  myterm xrm customization color  if one of your pathname specifications had the value usrlibx00appdefaultsnc then the expanded pathname would be usrlibx00appdefaultsmytermcolor because the c substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource  the default xfilesearchpath compiled into xt is  usrlibx00ltnc  r0 usrlibx00ltnc  r0 usrlibx00tnc     r0 usrlibx00ltn usrlibx00ltn usrlibx00tn  note some sites replace usrlibx00 with a projectroot in this batch of default settings  the default xuserfilesearchpath also compiled into xt is   rootlnc  r0 rootlnc  r0 rootnc     r0 rootln rootln rootn  root is either the value of xapplresdir or the users home directory if xapplresdir is not set  if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other than the default xt ignores xapplresdir altogether  notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your appdefaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir to  a single dot  in r0 all this machinery worked differently for r0 compatibilty many people set their xapplresdir value to  a dot followed by a slash    00 what order are callbacks executed in  courtesy of donna converse converseexpolcsmitedu 00000  the intrinsics library do not guarantee an order  this is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list  neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution  the application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list  even though the xt standard in the definition of xtaddcallback says   callbackname specifies the callback list to which the  procedure is to be appended   you may not infer from the word appended that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list   00 how do i know if a widget is visible  courtesy of donna converse converseexpolcsmitedu 00000   i am building a widget needs to know if it is visible i set the visible  interest field in core and if my window is completely obscured the core  visible flag goes false however if my window is iconified the flag  stays set to true  right everything is implemented correctly  this demonstrates a deficiency in the x protocol and the core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol  the deficiency is that the information is available in one way in this case an inconvenient way  the xt specification is accurate in the second and third paragraphs of section 0000 so read this section carefully  the visible field will not change in response to iconification  a visibilitynotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable that is when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped that is when iconification occurs  this is the protocol deficiency visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the x protocol see the glossary in your xlib and x protocol reference manual   is this a problem with mwm or is there something  else which needs to be done  youll see this with any window manager with no window manager   if the problem is mwm what is the fastest  way to determine if a window is iconified   as an application writer keep track with a global boolean in an action routine with translations for mapnotify and unmapnotify on the shell widget which contains your custom widget  as the custom widget writer see the mapstate field returned by a call to xgetwindowattributes  these are suggestions   00 how do i reparent a widget in xt ie xtreparentwidget   you cant   00 why use xtmalloc xtfree etc   unfortunately most code that calls malloc realloc or calloc tends to ignore the possibility of returning null  at best it is handled something like  ptr  type  malloc sizeof type if ptr  perror malloc in xyzzy exit 0  to handle this common case the intrinsics define the functions xtmalloc xtcalloc xtnew xtnewstring and xtrealloc which all use the standard c language functions malloc calloc and realloc but execute xterrormsg if a null value is returned  xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits  in addition if xtrealloc is called with a null pointer it uses xtmalloc to get the initial space  this allows code like  if ptr ptr  type  malloc sizeof type else ptr  type  realloc ptr sizeof type  count  0 count  to be written as  ptr  xtrealloc ptr sizeof ptr  count  also xtfree accepts a null pointer as an argument  generally ive found the xt functions conveniant to use  however anytime im allocating anything potentially large i use the standard functions so i can fully recover from not enough memory errors  xtnew and xtnewstring are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string    struct abc xyzzy   char     ptr   char     str  abcdef    xyzzy  xtnew struct abc takes care of type casting    ptr  xtnewstring str  a strict interpretation of the intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc and free  ie code such as   char      ptr   ptr  xtmalloc 000      free ptr  may not work  personally id call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor  a common error for motif programmers is to use xtfree on a string when they should really be using xmstringfree   00 how to debug an xt application  first id recomend getting purify from pure software  this is a great package for tracing memory problems on suns  its a bit pricey at 0000 but id still recomend it  excuse the marketing blurb contact supportpurecom for more info  purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into the object code produced by existing compilers  these instructions check every memory read and write performed by the program under test and detect several types of access errors such as reading unitialized memory writing past mallocd bounds or writing to freed memory  purify inserts checking logic into all of the code in a program including third party and vendor objectcode libraries and verifies system call interfaces  in addition purify tracks memory usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel adaption of garbage collection techniques  purifys nearly comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program down typically by a factor of two to five  an alternative package that isnt as pricey 000 for a sun runs on many unixs and has pretty similar features is the sentinel debugging environment  this replaces malloc and several other c library functions to add additional checks  contact cpcahilvirtechvticom for more info  next if you are getting any sort of xlib error youll need to run in synchronous mode easily accomplished with the sync command line argument or by setting the variable xdebug to 0 with your debugger  then set a break point in exit  this will let you trace back to the original xlib function being called  if you dont run in synchronous mode then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to xlib previously since the xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous  next if you are having trouble with window layout you can use the undocumented resource xtidentifywindows or the class resource xtdebug to cause the widget name to be identified with each window for example      example xload xrm xtdebugtrue      example xwininfo tree      click in new xload window  will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included  this can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets  next if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages its children you can try exportlcsmiteducontriblibxtgeotarz  this acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both  its a very clever idea  the most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse such as from a pulldown menu  the server effectively locks up and youll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually  the server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands unfortunately you cant give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped  the best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk running the program under a debugger or other environment on one machine and running the application on the other possibly using a command sequence like this  othermachine xhost thismachine thismachine setenv display othermachine0 thismachine gdb application your favorite debugger or this othermachine xhost thismachine thismachine gdb application gdb set environment display othermachine0 gdb run   i believe codecenter a c interpretergraphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints  debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work  you can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works  judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal   00 why dont xtaddinput xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc work     i have got a delicate problem with the three routines xtaddinput    xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc the problem i have is that when    i use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly    i have made a handy little testprogram where everything works    perfect but in my real application nothing happens   the introduction in r0 of the xtapp functions obsoleted those routines see q00 for other changes in r0 r0 and r0  what happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created  since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts you wont get those events  for example   cnt  0 toplevel  xtappinitializeapp class    desc xtnumber desc    argc argv    fallback args cnt  xtaddtimeout  xtaddworkproc   xtappmainloop app  would never invoke the timeout   00 what is and how can i implement drag and drop  courtesy of roger reynolds rogerrnetcomcom 00 feb 00  dragndrop is a buzzword for moving data between clients in an intuitive fashion  motif version 00 supports dragndrop capabilities openlook has supported dnd all along  the two protocols are not compatable with each other and so far as i know they are not published  i wrote a package called rdd which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag n drop operations between clients  my intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a standard dragndrop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell regardless of what widget set is used as long as it is based on xt  the implementation is based upon my understanding of the icccm conventions for more details read the code  i have heard from dozens of people using rdd who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than motif 00 stuff  also there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use motif anyway  the latest

   does anyone have any good ideas on how to integrate c code elegantly  with teleuse uimx  interface architect generated code    source would be great but any suggestions are welcome      hubie chou  000 0000000  hubecctpcom    i dont know a great deal about the support for c in uimx but i can tell  you that there is good support for it in teleuse  in teleuse you can call any c method from a d module  what you can do then is to use the d language for most of your interface code and then use c for you application code  i should tell you that there is some real neat stuff coming out of teleuse soon in regard to c but i cant give you many details  you should talk to your local sales rep and get the lowdown on what they will be doing in the near furture  if you want example code of how c integrates with teleuse you should look at teleuseexamplesthermometer     steve vranyes                                                                  voice     000 000  0000                                                    email    stevevrecscommmotcom                                            uspost  motorola inc                                                                  0000 e algonquin rd                                                          schaumburg il 00000

  hi   im trying to write a motif program on an interactive unix machine and im observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a drawingarea namely some xlib operations work and some do not in particular the expose consist of two xfillrectangle calls followed by some xdrawpoint calls and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is clicked on and moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area but after the move is still on some part of the drawing area this also happens less consistently when the pulldownpopup is moved in the leftward direction  assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd is this a server bug  thanks  zack t smith   
   i have heard of two packages for the pc that support xwin the first is linux which is a free unix package  the second is xappeal which sounds pretty good  it can be found at  garbouwusafi in the ftppcdemo dir  the files are  xap00exezip xap00fonzip driverszip  this should get you started  josh     joshua weage  us snail  000 spring rd baroda mi  00000    email cs000freenetinacwruedu   ai000yfnysuedu         fidonet  joshua weage  00000000                            all ideas are my own and no one elses                        
  im writing xwall a simple x version of wall and i want it to put a message up on each of a default list of displays  the problem is that xopendisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently controlled by xdm login screen   ive been through the manuals and faq and dont see a simple way to see if a display is openable ahead of time or to get xopendisplay to fail after a short period of time  any hints suggestions clues or pointers to info  thanks    andy moore andyicestxcom  you could say ive lost faith in the politicians  they all seem like game show hosts to me           sting  
  im considering writing my own widgets but i like to have some sample widget source code to look over first  where could i find something like this  are there any archives accessible by anonymous ftp that contain  such information  thanks edward     
  i have looked through the faq sections and have not seen a answer for this  i have an xmotif application that i have written i have a couple of gif files or pict that i have scanned in with a color scanner  now i would like to be able to convert the gif files into a format that could be read into my application and displayed on the background of its main window preferably with pixmaps or perhaps as an ximage  i have found functions in the pbmplus program suite to convert gif to xbm but that is monochrome and i really do need color  i have looked at xv which reads in gif and writes out several formats but have not found a way to write out a file which can be read in as a pixmap  is there an easy way to do this  email responses preferred  thanks  mark  ahleniusrtsgmotcom    regards   mark   mark ahlenius   voice0000000000  email ahleniusmarblertsgmotcom motorola inc  fax  0000000000 arlington hts il usa 00000

file x x    this file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to x    the international obfuscated c code contest ioccc for short x x    this is not the ioccc rules though it does contain comments about x    them  the guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions x    entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are x    allowed  even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines x x    you should read the current ioccc rules prior to submitting entries x    the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines x x    changes from the 0000 draft are noted by change bars         x x xwhat is new in 0000 x x    the entry format is better for us anyway  the program mkentryc x    has been updated  see entry format x x    we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c x    compiler  certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers x    fits are no longer permitted  some of the new issues deal with x    nonintegral array types variable number of arguments c preprocessor x    directives and the exit function  see our likes and dislikes x x xhints and suggestions x x    you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests  see x    for more information for details on how to get previous winners x x    keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries x    may not be valid entries this year  what was unique and novel one year x    might be old the next year x x    an entry is usually examined in a number of ways  we typically apply x    a number of tests to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi trigraphs to ascii x c preprocess the source ignoring include lines x c preprocess the source ignoring define and include lines x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x    you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x    you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x    cleaned up by the c preprocessor and a c beautifier x x    your entry need not do well under all or in most tests  in certain x    cases a test is not important  entries that compete for the x    strangestmost creative source layout need not do as well as x    others in terms of their algorithm  on the other hand given x    two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that x    does something interesting when you run it x x    we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules  as such we leave x    the contest open for creative rule interpretation  as in real life x    programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x    is important  for this reason we often award worst abuse of the x    rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x    if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know x    in the remarks section  please note that an invitation to abuse x    is not an invitation to break  we are strict when it comes to the x    0000 byte size limit  also abusing the entry format tends to x    annoy more than amuse x x    we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries x    to attempt to exploit them  we will award worst abuse of the rules x    and then plug the hole next year  even so we will attempt to use x    the smallest plug needed if not smaller   x x    check out your program and be sure that it works  we sometimes make x    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly x    in or near the final round  on the other hand we have seen some x    of the best entries fall down because they didnt work x x    we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that x    00 is a prime number  if you do have a bug you are better off x    documenting it  noting this entry sometimes prints the 0th power x    of a prime by mistake would save the above entry  and sometimes x    a strange bugfeature can even help the entry  of course a correctly x    working entry is best x x xour likes and dislikes x x    doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old  we x    tend to see thru masses of defines due to our preprocessor tests x    that we apply  simply abusing defines or dfoobar wont go as far x    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x x    many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x xdefine d define xd foo    dont expect this to turn into define foo x xint i xj    dont use such implicit type declaration xint k x x    we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler  if you x    must use nonansi c such as kr c you must avoid areas that result in x    compilelink errors for ansi c compilers x x    unfortunately some ansi c compilers require array indexes to be of        x    integral type  thus the following classical obfuscation hacks should     x    not be used in 0000  this rule may be relaxed in future contests       x xint i xchar c xic    use ci instead xi0string    use stringi0 instead x x    if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x    arguments be careful systems implement valist as a wide variety x    of ways  because of this a number of operations using valist are x    not portable and must not be used x x assigning a nonvalist variable tofrom a valist variable x casting a nonvalist variable intofrom a valist variable x passing a valist variable to a function expecting a nonvalist arg x passing a nonvalist variable to a function expecting a valist arg x performing arithmetic on valist variables x using valist as a structure or union x x    in particular do not treat valist variables as if they were a char s x x    avoid using varargsh use stdargh instead x x    if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef  x    the leading  must be the first character on a line  while some x    c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading  many do not x x    because the exit function returns void on some systems entries x    must not assume that it returns an int x x    small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x    while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do x    serve a useful purpose  they are often the only program that people x    attempt to completely understand  for this reason we look for x    programs that are compact and are instructional x x    one line programs should be short one line programs say around 00 x    bytes long  getting close to 000 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x x    we tend to dislike programs that x x are very hardware specific x are very os or unx version specific x     indexstrchr differences are ok but socketstreams specific x      code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings x     it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x wont compile under both bsd or sys v unx x abusing the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi trigraphs x are longer than they need to be x are similar to previous winners x are identical to previous losers   x x    unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the x    best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x x    the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x    limit  it is one thing to make use of a several ds to help out x    but it is quite another to use 000 bytes of ds in order to x    try and squeeze the source under the size limit  you should feel x    free to make use of the build file space but you are better off x    if you show some amount of restraint x x    we allowed whitespace and in certain cases   or  do not impact x    your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x x    given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob x    of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x    program we tend to favor the second version  of course a third x    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x    andor obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x x    we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest selfreplicating x    program  we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x    to be the smallest  there is nothing wrong with selfreplicating x    programs  in fact a number of winners have been selfreplicating x    you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x    know of a smaller one x x    x client entries should be as portable as possible  entries that x    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored  dont x    depend on a particular type of display  for example dont depend x    on color or a given size  dont require backing store x x    x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x    software that is not in wide spread use  we ask that such x client x    entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x    athena widget set libx00a libxawa libxmua and libxta x    dont use mtif xvew or openlok toolkits since not everyone x    has them  avoid depending on a particular window manager  not x    everyone has x00r0 and some people are stuck back in x00r0 or x    earlier so try to target x00r0 without requiring x00r0  better x    yet try to make your entry run on all version 00 x window systems x x    x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x    xdefaults  if you must do so be sure to note the required lines x    in the remark section x x    we like programs that x x are as concise and small as they need to be x do something at least quasiinteresting x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x make us laugh andor throw up   x x    some types of programs cant excel in some areas  of course your x    program doesnt have to excel in all areas but doing well in several x    areas really does help x x    we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in x    the remark section helps your chance of winning  if you had to x    read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x    we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x x    be creative x x xentry format x x    in order to help us process the many entries we must request your x    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way  this format x    in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the x    author from the program itself  see judging process x x    we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to x    format entries  you should be aware of the following warning that x    is found in mkentryc x xthis program attempts to implement the

assume that the source is progc x    and will compile into prog  if an entry wins we will rename x    its source and binary to avoid filename collision  by tradition x    we use the name of the entrys title followed by an optional x    digit in case of name conflicts x x    if the above entry somehow won the least likely to win award x    we would use chonglabc and chonglab x x    if your entry depends on or requires that your build source x    andor binary files be a particular name please say so in the x    remark section  if this case applies it would be be helpful x    if you did one of the following x x tell us how to change the filenames in your entry x x have the build file make copies of the files  for example x xcc progc o specialnameneed special binary x x    or  rm f specialsrccneed special source xcp progc specialsrcc xcc specialsrcc o specialname x x    or  rm f specialbuildneed special build xtail 0 build  specialbuild xsh  specialbuild x x assume that we will use the entry title  send us a version of x  your buildprogram files that uses the name convention  you x  should uuencode these files in data sections x x    if your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files x    please say so in the remark section  you should try to avoid x    touching your original build source and binary files  you should x    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify  this x    will allow people to regenerate your entry from scratch x x    remember that your entry may be built without a build file  we x    typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile  if the x    build file must exist say so in the remark section x x    if your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them x    into info sections  in the case of multiple info files x    use multiple info sections  if no info files are needed x    then skip the info section x x    info files are intended to be input or detailed information that x    does not fit well into the remark section  for example an x    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample x    programs for the user to compile  an entry might want to include a x    lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a x    hints file x x    info files should be used only to supplement your entry  for x    example info files may provide sample input or detailed x    information about your entry  because they are supplemental x    the entry should not require them exist x x    in some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name x    conflicts  if info files should not be renamed for some reason x    say so in the remark section x x    info files must uudecode into the current directory  if they x    absolutely must be renamed or moved into a subdirectory say x    so in the remark section x x    when submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has x    a unique entry number from 0 to 0  your first entry should x    have entry number 0 x x    with the exception of the header all text outside of the entry x    format may be ignored  that is dont place text outside of the x    entry and expect the judges to see it  our decoding tools arent x    ai progs if you need tell the the something put it in the x    remark section or send a email to the judges at x xapplepyramidsunuunethoptoadjudgesnot the address for xjudgestoadcom submitting entries x x    the date should be given with respect to utc  some systems refer x    to this as gmt or gmt0  the format of the date should be that as x    returned by asctime in the c locale  an example of such a string is x xthr apr 00 000000 0000 x x    this format is similar to the output of the date0 command  the x    string does not include the timezone name before the year  on many x    systems one of the following command will produce a similar string x xdate u a h d t 00y xdate u  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzutc date  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzgmt date  sed e s 0000000 xsh c tzgmt0 date  sed e s 0000000 x x    you are allowed to updatefixrevise your entry  to do so set x    the fix line in the entry section to y instead of n x    be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x    as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be x    replaced x x xjudging process x x    entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll x x    entries are unpacked into individual directories  the email message x    is unpacked into individual files each containing x xentry section xall author sections xall info sections xbuild section xprogram section xany other text including the email message headers x x    prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be sure x    it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was x    malformed and did not unpack correctly  information from the x    author sections are not read until the judging process is x    complete and then only from entries that have won an award x x    the above process helps keep us biased foragainst any one particular x    individual  we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x    until the final awards are given  we like the surprise of finding x    out in the end who won and where they were from x x    we attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award x    because the main prize of winning is being announced we make all x    attempts to send nonwinners into oblivion  we remove all nonwinning x    files and shred all related paper  by tradition we do not even x    reveal the number of entries that we received  for the curious x    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x    winners at talks x x    after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to the x    authors of the winning entries  one reason we do this is to give x    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x    entry  they are given the chance to correct mistakes typos  we x    often accept their suggestionscomments about our remarks as well x    this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world x x    judging consists of a number of elimination rounds  during a round x    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles x    the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does x    not  we also reexamine the entries that were eliminated in the x    previous round  thus an entry gets at least two readings x x    a reading consists of a number of actions x x reading the entry section x reading the uudecoded build section x reading the uudecoded program section x reading the uudecoded info sections if any x passing the source thru the c preprocessor x    shipping over any include files x performing a number of c beautifycleanup edits on the source x passing the beautified source thru the c preprocessor x    shipping over any include files x x    in later rounds other actions are performed x x linting the source x compilingbuilding the source x running the program x performing misc tests on the source and binary x x    until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 00 entries entries x    are judged on an individual basis  an entry is set aside because it x    does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round x    when the number of entries thins to about 00 entries we begin to form x    award categories  entries begin to compete with each other for awards x    an entry often will compete in several categories x x    the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x    we receive  a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x strangestmost creative source layout x most useful obfuscated program x best game that is obfuscated x most creatively obfuscated program x most deceptive c code x best x client see our likes and dislikes x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rules x anything else so strange that it deserves an award x x    we do not limit ourselves to this list  for example a few entries are so x    goodbad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x    we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x x    in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of x    reducing the remaining entries typically about 00 down to 0 or 00 x    winners  often we are confident that the entries that make it into x    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x    make it  the selection of the winners out of the final round is x    less clear cut x x    sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out x    by a similar but slightly better entry  for this reason it is x    sometimes worthwhile to reenter an improved version of an entry x    that failed to win in a previous year  this assumes of course x    that the entry is worth improving in the first place x x    more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a x    strangecreative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest x    rules in some way x x    in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best  sometimes such x    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry  more often the x    best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x x xannouncement of winners x x    the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference  by tradition x    this is done during the latter part of the uunetioccc bof just prior to x    the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x x

  i might have a need in the future to display rotated text  i noticed the xvertext package on the net  it looks very good but it has one slight problem  the api to it assumes you have a font name not an already loaded font  it shouldnt be too difficult to split up the function into two interface routines one with a font name and one with an xfontstruct but i thought i would ask the author alan richardson mppa0ukacsussexsyma first in case he was planning this already unfortunately his email address bounced  does alan r or the current maintainer of xvertext see this  the email address you mentioned above is for use with the uk  as you know the brits do everything backwards   so the real address from the states is  mppa0symasussexacuk  give it a try   harvard   ucbvaxuwvaxastroatcftmsbrown  or  uu0psicomftmsbrown rutgers internet brownwiextrelcom  or  ftmsbrownastroatcuucpcswiscedu

  you are right in supposing that the problem is with the xmncolormap xtncolormap for truly literate beings not being set  what you want to do is start your application with your new colormap  this can be a chicken and egg sort of problem however  if you look at the xt faq there is an example that should show how it can be done  if not let me know and maybe i can improve the example  pete  pete warewarecisohiostateedu cis dept ohio state universityw 000 0000000 000 bolz hall 0000 neil aveh 000 0000000 columbus oh 00000

  i have a program produces a continuous tone by calling xbell repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell if it is run more than once on a display the tones are buffered in the x server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program have exited is there a convenient way of preventing this eg by emptying the x server bell buffer when each program exits  disclaimer please note that the above is a personal view and should not    be construed as an official comment from the jet project  
      in my opinion a programming degree is still worth having   yes but a cs degree is not a programming degree does anybody know of a computing course where programming is taught  computer science is a branch of maths or the course i did was  ive also done a software engineering course  much more practical and likely to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think they want but also did not teach programming the ability to program was an entry requirement  at robert gordon university programming was the main most timeconsuming  start of the course the first two years consisted of five subjects software engineering pascalcunix computer engineering 0000000000000  assembler computer theory lispprolog mathematicsstatistics and  communication skills how to pass interviewsintelligence tests and group discussions eg how to survive a helicopter crash in the north sea the third year industrial placement was spent working for a computer company  for a year the company could be anywhere in europe there was a special  travel allowance scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors   the fourth year included operating systemscmodula0 software engineering  c0000 assembler real time laboratory c00000 assembler and computing  theory lisp  there were also group projects in 0nd and 0th years where  students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an  outside company the only disadvantage being that specifications would change  suddenly   in the first four years there was a 0000 weighting between courseworks and  exams for most subjects however in the honours year this was reduced to a  0000 split between an individual project and final exams no coursework  assessment  are all computer science courses like this  btw  we started off with 00 students in our first year and were left with 0 by honours year also every course is tutored separately not easy trying to sleep when you are in 0 student class    cheers   michael     michael s a robb      tel 00 00 000 0000   the problem with bolton  software engineer       fax 00 00 000 0000    software is making sure the  spider systems limited  email                 bolts are the right size  edinburgh eh0 0ng      michaelrspidercouk               anonymous

around this problem the patch is on export in 000 contribx00r0sunos000patchversion0z   i used gcc to compile the whole distribution but i get several segmentation faults when running x  note first that gcc on risc machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 000x0 or vax platforms  here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing  structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when  gcccompiled parts of x are linked with sunsupplied functions that pass or  return structs runtime errors occur  affected programs include rgb and  the server  this is from the gcc manual  on the sparc gnu cc uses an incompatible calling convention for  structures  it passes them by including their contents in the argument list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by  reference  this really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet supported in gnu cc so it isnt straightforward to fix it  the convention for structure returning is also incompatible and fpccstructreturn does not help  you can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags    files which need to be compiled using cc include serveros00bsdoscolorc  rgbrgbc  in addition several of the inet functions use structs as args or return values   clientsxhostxhostc  clientsxauthgethostc  calls to inetaddr in libclxsocketc and libxxconndisc are possibly  harmless as they dont involve structs  collected by bashfordscrippsedu don bashford 000   when i try to run xinit or the xsun server i get the error  getting interface configuration operation not supported on socket  fatal server bug no screens found  running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didnt work you can do  this simple test  include sysioctlh siocgifconf  run that through cc e and gcc e  the last line of output is the piece of  interest it should be identical modulo irrelevant differences like  whitespace  if the gcc version has x where the cc version has i your  fixincludes run didnt work for some reason or other go back to your gcc sources and run fixincludes then rebuild the x distribution if they are  identical try running a make clean in mitserver and rebuilding just to make  sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files    courtesy der mouse mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu 000   in mitserverddxsunsuncg0cc we have found missing defines for  cg0acmonolen cg0bcmonolen cg0acenblen cg0bcenblen what should these be  the r0 errata list distributed after x00r0 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older sunos versions eg 00 to compile         define cg0acmonolen 0000000         define cg0acenblen  cg0acmonolen         define cg0bcmonolen cg0acmonolen         define cg0bcenblen  cg0acmonolen  however the sun0 should not actually ever have the cg0 device and so  references to it can be removed from mitserverddxsunsuninitc and the  imakefile  0000   the file sundevcg0regh isnt being found  sun omitted sundevcg0regh from sunos 000 remove the include  from suncg0cc and replace it with the line  define cg0vaddrcolor   0x00000000 the file has changed from earlier versions of sunos and should not be copied  from another distribution   all of the executables that i try to run have the following results ldso libxmuso0 not found or even ldso call to undefined procedure gethostname from 0xf000a00c  if you are building with shared libraries on a sun remember that you  need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries if youve installed x on a fileserver run it on the servers clients too  while  building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing x shared libraries you might have eg those  distributed with openwindows  you should make sure you do not have  ldlibrarypath set in your environment during the build or the installation   if you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in usrlib usrlocallib or  usr0lib for these programs to work or else those programs must be linked  statically courtesy mit x consortium note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been installed you can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically pass bstatic to most c compilers    this is a bug in the olit  xtqstring was an external symbol that existed in  x00r0 upon which ow 00s libxt is based  it wasnt documented and was  removed in x00r0 mits guarantee of upward compatibility between the r0 and r0 libraries only applied to the documented interface    a workaround is to temporarily set your ldlibrarypath to point to the x00r0 or openwindows xt library that you linked the program against  0000 from barry margolin barmarthinkcom 000 from jeff francis  jpfheliocentriccom    there is a security problem with certain r0 clients xterm and xload running under sunos 00 that have been installed setuid root and are using  shared libraries to avoid the problem do one of these 0 make the program nonsetuid you should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources eg ptys and devkmem used by these programs to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site 0 relink the programs statically using bstatic 0 install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries  from rwsexpolcsmitedu bob scheifler 0000  the r0 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newlyinstalled libraries when xterm is being installed this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from nfsmounted disks  xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem    on many systems the framebuffer is unsecured by default this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the framebuffer directly or as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying to accidentally start up a second x session on your console  display check the man page for fbtab0  thanks to art mulder artcsualbertaca 000     imake is not a replacement for the make program instead it is a makefilegenerator that takes advantages of the includefile and macro processing capabilities of the c preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles  suitable for building software on a particular system although it is not  specific to x the x release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by which the systemspecific configuration files systemindependent configuration files and individual imakefiles are melded to produce a makefile is not  obvious there have been several different versions of imake the r0 r0 and r0 versions are different  you can obtain information on imake from these sources  the r0 and r0 release notes and imake man page include information on using imake to build x  the r0 and r0 file mitconfigreadme also contains useful information  on the r0 tapes contribdocimakeimaketex is mark moraes r0r0 guide to imake  the r0 mitdocconfigusenixwspaperms contains a paper by jim fulton on an early version of imake  paul dubois duboisprimatewiscedu has written a useful  explanation of how imake works and how to use it in configuring x for non supported systems the document is available from ftpprimatewiscedu in the directory

 sasun0epflchpubimakefile0z  0000000000000    versions are distributed with the r0 and r0 releases an earlier  version is distributed with the x00r0 release some thirdparty toolkits  redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the  template and configuration files there are no real standards for such  configuration files although most current contributed software expects the  templates distributed with x00r0 export contains the r0 distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution a standalone version of imake but one stemming from x00r0 is in ftpgermanyeunetpubx00miscimakeimakepuretarz 0000000000    if you have r0 or r0 installed on your system run xmkmf this is a  script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments the output is a  makefile configured for your system and based on the imakefile then run make  which will use that new makefile to compile the program   when i try to compile certain programs i get the following link error undefined xshapequeryextension xshapecombinemask  these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x shape which was introduced in the mit x00r0 distribution and allows nonrectangular windows  like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it  prex00r0 servers as well as many  vendorsupplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway  in order to use the shape extension you must link to the library  libxexta  in the x00r0 distribution this library and the associated includes will be in the mitextensions directory  if you do not have these files do  not despair  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be  compiled without it by removing the dshape define from the makefile you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendorsupplied x  libraries  from john b melby melbyykfujitsucojpuunetuunet 000   when i run a x program that i wrote on a sunos 000 or 00 machine i get the  error ldso symbol not found xtinherit  what you are seeing is a sideeffect of a kludge in the r0 libxta to  get sun shared libraries working  apparently you cant share a function that  is both called and compared as xtinherit is this was handled by putting  xtinherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded  that is in initializec where  xttoolkitinitialize and xtinitialize reside these routines would normally be called  you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal xtbased program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize anywhere  0 it may be a program that uses xt functions but never opens a  connection to the x server  osfmotifs 000 uil had this problem it called xtmalloc and other xt functions the solution is to add the call to your  program the function does not have to be executed just linked in 0 alternatively your program doesnt need any xt functions and is correct in not calling xttoolkitinitialize  it may be an xlib or xview  program in this case you can remove lxt from your link command   it should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically although this will certainly solve the problem  from jordan hayes now jordanmoorenetcom and danny backx dbsunbimbe  0000   i have a program that worked well under x00r0 when i try to link it under  the current version of x i get this message undefined xtscrollbarsetthumb xttextsetinsertionpoint xttextreplace  there were several name changes in the athena widget set in addition to the header files moving into x00xaw these are mentioned in the r0 release notes in this case these functions are not really xt functions but are part of the xaw text widget and so have been renamed from xt to xaw 0000     the window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another  in order to get keystrokes your program must ask the window manager for the input focus  to do this you must set up what are called hints for the window manager  if your applications is xlibbased you can use something like the following          xwmhints wmhints                  wmhintsflags  inputhint         wmhintsinput  true         xsetwmhintsdpy window wmhints  if your application is based on the xt intrinsics you can set the xtninput  resource to be true as you probably want to in any case if you dont have source you can start up the application with the resource inputtrue  certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having  this done   if you are using suns openwindows olwm you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that arent icccmcompliant openwindowsfocuslenience       true  mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun    you cant reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case  for most cases you shouldnt care which window manager is running so  long as you do things in an icccmconformant manner there are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases alternatively it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific added features such as olwms pushpin menus in order to give your program added functionality beware of usurping the window  managers functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing this surely leads to future compatibility problems    there is no general framework such as the transskel program for the  macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development in x the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cutpaste on existing x applications good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just  this one little thing include contribclientsxskel a simple r0 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks the xaw examples in the examples directory in the r0 and r0  distributions and the xlib hello world example in the r0 dochelloworld and  r0 doctutorialshelloworld an updated version of this program which uses r0  xlib calls and current icccm conventions was posted in 000 to compwindowsx   by glenn widener of tektronix 000  in addition a sample xt program for xaw or xm by rainer klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on exportlcsmitedu in contribmdisptarz 000    the xtgetvalues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable your code may be doing something like this  arg args0 int i int sensitive oops wrong data type  i0 xtsetarg argsi xtnsensitive sensitive i xtgetvalueswidget args i     but xtnsensitive is a boolean which on most machines is a single byte  declaring the variable sensitive as boolean works properly this problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the xt types  dimension and position code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short in general you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource as it appears in the widgets man page 0000    youre probably trying to use these functions from application code they should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children other promising  functions xtmakegeometryrequest and xtmakeresizerequest are also for use  only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its parent the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an xtsetvalues call setting some of the geometry resources although this will result in the widgetinternal functions being called your application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the  widgets data becoming corrupted the xlib calls xmovewindow and xresizewindow should similarly be  avoided they shouldnt be used to change xtnx xtny xtnwidth or xtnheight    although there are various details of the current implementation of the xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the new widget should be resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves what should happen to the widgets children and by the time such semantics are defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old  widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired  resources as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in  creating a new widget  note that reparenting is possible in the oi toolkit

converseexpolcsmitedu    although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered  the specification does not guarantee such a sequence and supplemental  authoritative documents ie the asenteswick volume do say that the order is undefined  because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application xt cannot guarantee the order of execution in general the callback procedures should be thought of as operating  independently of one another and should not depend on sideeffects of other callbacks operating if a seqence is needed then the single callback to be  registered can explicitly call other functions necessary  000 thanks to converseexpolcsmitedu    xtdestroywidget operates in two passes in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures the functioncall marks the widget which is not  actually destroyed until your program returns to its eventloop     it is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback which has a clear flow of control the calls to askuser block until answer is set to one of the valid values if it is not a yes answer the code drops out of the callback and back to an eventprocessing loop   void quitwidget w xtpointer client xtpointer call  int             answer answer  askuserw really quit if retyes  answer  answer  askuserw are you really positive if retyes  answer exit0                    a more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether  to overwrite it this is accomplished by entering a second eventprocessing loop and waiting until the user answers the question the answer is returned to the calling function that function askuser looks something like this where the  motif can be

widgetclass  drawing area     window  xtwindowcanvas get the window associated with the widget     xdrawline window produces error   the window associated with the widget is created as a part of the  realization of the widget  using a window id of null no window could  create the error that you describe  it is necessary to call xtrealizewidget  before attempting to use the window associated with a widget  note that the window will be created after the xtrealizewidget call  but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet so you should also  wait for an expose event on the window before drawing into it    the badmatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of  the screen if you dont want to catch the error and deal with it you can take the following steps to avoid the error  0 make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture 0 clear the pixmap to background using xfillrectangle 0 use xcopyarea to copy the window to the pixmap 0 if you get a noexpose event the copy was clean use xgetimage to grab the image from the pixmap 0 if you get one or more graphicsexpose events the copy wasnt clean and  the xywidthheight members of the graphicsexpose event structures tell you  the parts of the pixmap which arent good 0 get rid of the pixmap it probably takes a lot of memory  0000 thanks to oliver jones ojpictelcom    a number of programs offer x modes but otherwise run in a straight characteronly mode the easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an x display is to attempt to open a connection to the x

function you are calling is already executing it can leave the library in an inconsistent state note that the ansi c standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by  xlib or xt functions you can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added  note the article in the x journal 00 and the example in oreilly  volume 0 are in error  thanks to pete ware warecisohiostateedu and donna converse  converseexpolcsmitedu 000    you may see these errors if you issue xlib requests from an xlib error  handler or more likely if you make calls which generate x requests to xt or  xlib from a signal handler which you shouldnt be doing in any case     its very common to need to write an xt program that can accept input  both from a user via the x connection and from some other file descriptor but  which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the x connection or  the other file descriptor a solution is use xtappaddinput after you open your file descriptor use xtappaddinput to register an input handler the input handler will be  called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your  programs attention write the input handler like you would any other xt  callback so it does its work quickly and returns  it is important to use only nonblocking io system calls in your input handlers most input handlers read the file descriptor although you can have an  input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file you will find that the function is called even when there isnt input pending xtappaddinput is actually working as it is supposed to the input handler is  called whenever the file descriptor is ready to be read not only when there is new data to be read a disk file unlike a pipe or socket is almost always  ready to be read however if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data youve read before  the result is that your function will almost always be called every time around xtappmainloop there is a way to get the  type of interaction you are expecting add this line to the beginning of your  function to test whether there is new data      if ioctlfd fionread n  0  n  0 return but because this is called frequently your application is effectively in a  busywait you may be better off not using xtappaddinput and instead setting  a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input  courtesy dan heller argvoracom 000 mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu 000 ollie jones ojpictelcom 000    you can do this using xsendevent its likely that youre not setting the window field in the event which xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event  if youre sending events to your own application then you can use  xtdispatchevent instead this is more efficient than xsendevent in that you avoid a roundtrip to the server depending on how well the widget was written you may be able to call its action procedures in

the wrong  thing to do in a finished program as it ignores the users preference for  foreground and background  and also note that you can run into the same situation in an xtbased program if you draw into the xtwindoww right after it has been realized it may not yet have appeared    the screen is an xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single x display supports a  server can support several independent screens they are numbered unix00 unix00 unix00 etc the screen or screennumber is the second digit  the 0 0 0 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available  screens on this particular display connection the macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular screen on which your application is running typically have two forms  one which takes a screen and one with takes both the display and the screennumber in xtbased programs you typically use xtscreenwidget to determine  the screen on which your application is running if it uses a single screen part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the screen have display in the names

create a pixmap set it to be the background pixmap of a window and then free the pixmap the  window keeps this background but the pixmap itself is destroyed  if youre  sure a window has a background pixel not a pixmap you can use xcleararea  to clear a region to the background color and then use xgetimage to read  back that pixel  however this action alters the contents of the window and  it suffers from race conditions with exposures courtesy dave lemke of ncd  and stuart marks of sun  note that the same applies to the border pixelpixmap this is a  misfeature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixelpixmap however it wants  by not requiring the server to keep the  original pixel or pixmap some potentially a lot of space can be saved  courtesy jim fulton mit x consortium    a completely transparent window is easy to get  use an inputonly window in order to create a window which is mostly transparent you have several choices  the shape extension first released with x00r0 offers an easy way to make nonrectangular windows so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent however not all servers  support the extension  a machinespecific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware  note  that there is no x notion of a transparent color index  a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny  windows but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult  a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information if so you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly  thanks to der mouse mouselightningmcrcimmcgilledu 000 see also the x journal 00 for a more complete answer including code samples for this last option    when using gxxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black for example should produce white however the drawing operation does not work on rgb values but on colormap indices the color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself on many x servers black and white often 00 or 00 programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break if you want to be combining colors with gxxor then you should be  allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen precomputed values if you want to use gxxor simply to switch between two colors then you  can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the gc graphics  context to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over  red say the result is blue and when it draws over blue the result is red  this foreground value is itself the xor of the colormap indices of red and  blue  thanks to

nothing and 00000 is  fullblast if you forget to scale using for example 0000 for each color  the xalloccolor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is  usually black   thanks to paul asente asenteadobecom 000   i have an imageprocessing program which uses xgetrgbcolormap to get the  standard colormap but it doesnt work   xgetrgbcolormap when used with the property xargbdefaultmap does  not create a standard colormap  it just returns one if one already exists use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first  000 from der mouse mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu    the initial contents of pixmaps are undefined  this means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there   which is usually garbage  you probably want to clear the pixmap first using xfillrectangle with a function of gxcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever  color you want as your background or 0l if you are using the pixmap as a  mask courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun   my program has the id of a window on a remote display i want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it  because x is asynchronous there isnt a guarantee that the window  would still exist between the time that you got the id and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it what you should do is send the event without checking but install an error handler to catch any badwindow  errors which would indicate that the window no longer exists this scheme will work except on the rare occasion that the original window has been destroyed  and its id reallocated to another window  courtesy ken lee kleesynopticscom 000    yes the x server assigns ids to windows and other resources actually the server assigns some bits the client others and any application that  knows the id can manipulate the resource almost any x server resource except for gcs and private color cells can be shared the problem you face is how to disseminate the window id to multiple  applications a simple way to handle this and which solves the problem of the applications running on different machines is in the first application to  create a speciallynamed property on the rootwindow and put the window id into it the second application then retrieves the property whose name it also knows and then can draw whatever it wants into the window note this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the question about using window ids on remote displays note also that you will still need to coordinate any higherlevel  cooperation among your applications  note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to  use the same server connection if one process is a child of the other it  should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection  mostly courtesy phil karlton karltonwpdsgicom 000    a number of applications including xwd xwininfo and xsetroot do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use they typically return  the wrong child of

  resizing the window is done through the window manager window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window but  there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen you can try setting  the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best  000    its rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself eg by tracking visibilitynotify events so that it isnt overlapped   imagine the conflict between two such programs running   the only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window overrideredirect this means that you are temporarily assuming windowmanagement duties while the window is up so you want to do  this infrequently and then only for short periods of time eg for popup  menus or other short parametersetting windows  thanks to der mouse mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu 000    there is no easy way  unless youre willing to depend on some sort of extension as yet nonexistent you have to arrange for the blinking yourself either by redrawing the contents periodically or if possible by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents  thanks to mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu der mouse 000    users of xt have the support of the translation manager to help  get notification of doubleclicking there is no good way to get only a doubleclick in xlib because the  protocol does not provide enough support to do doubleclicks  you have to do  clientside timeouts unless the singleclick action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server  thus you  have to do timeouts which means systemdependent code  on most unixish  implementations you can use xconnectionnumber to get the file descriptor of  the x connection and then use select or something similar on that note that many userinterface references suggest that a doubleclick be used to extend the action indicated by a singleclick if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it too should be the singleclick action or the doubleclick action  thanks to mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu der mouse 000    xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics  capabilities leaving them up to serverextensions or clientsside graphics libraries your only choice if you want to stay within the core x protocol is to render the text into a pixmap read it back via xgetimage rotate it by  hand with whatever matrices you want and put it back to the server via  xputimage more specifically 0 create a bitmap b and write your text to it 0 create an xybitmap image i from b via xgetimage 0 create an xybitmap image i0 big enough to handle

algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better the highlevel serverextensions and graphics packages available for x  also permit rendering of rotated text display postscript pex phigs and gks although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer in addition if you have enough access to the server to install a

system and has as its major goal the promotion of  cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software  interfaces at all layers in the x window system environment mits role is to provide the vendorneutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work membership in the  consortium open to any organization  there are two categories of membership  member for large organizations and affiliate for smaller organizations most of the consortiums activities take place via electronic mail  with meetings when required  as designs and specifications take shape interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations   typically a small multiorganization architecture team leads the design with  others acting as close observers and reviewers  once a complete specification is produced it may be submitted for formal technical review by the consortium as a proposed standard  the standards process typically includes public

that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 0d graphics many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 0d objects the extension  allows the client phigs in this case to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 0d graphics sun microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable copyright similar to the current x copyright sample implementation  source and documentation are available in the r0 release several vendors are currently selling independentlydeveloped pex servers for  their workstations and x terminals  last modified 0000    there are several options for using x over serial lines  slip  serial line ip this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending ip packets over pointtopoint serial links it has been around for several years and implementations are available for many of the major tcpip implementations most x terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow  the tcpip headers add 00 bytes per  packet and the tcpip encoding of the x protocol is rather verbose rightfully  so it is optimized for packing and unpacking over highspeed links   cslip  compressed header slip this is a variant of slip that compresses the  00 bytes of tcpip headers down to about 0 or 0 bytes  it still doesnt do  anything about reencoding the x protocol  modems that do compression can help but they increase packet latency it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces plus the compression assembly time  ppp  pointtopoint protocol this is an emerging standard for pointtopoint links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than slip  a growing number of people see the combination of ppp for the serial  line management and cslip for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal tcpip protocols over serial lines  running raw x over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable  xremote  this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by ncd for squeezing the x protocol over serial lines  in addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to pppcslip xremote removes  redundancies in the x protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using lzw to compress the entire data stream  this work is done by either a  pseudox server or proxy running on the host or in a terminal server  there  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem    0you dont have to have compressing modems in there if you wouldnt  otherwise be using them eg if you were going to be directly  connected and    0it reduces the io overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that have to cross the serial interface and    0in addition to the effects of 0 it reduces the latency in delivering  packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for  blocks to compress  lbx  low bandwidth x this is an x consortium project that is working on a standard for this area  it is being chaired by ncd and xerox and is using  ncds xremote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol  lbx will go beyond xremote by adding proxy caching of commonlyused information  eg connection setup data large window properties font metrics keymaps  etc and a more efficient encoding of the x protocol the hope is to have a  standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in r0  additional technical information about how xremote works and a few notes on how lbx might be different are available via anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu in contrib in the following files         xremoteslidesps

file your x  session runs only as long as the last job is running and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out instead run the window manager in the background and as the last job instead invoke something safe like exec xterm name login rv iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action your x session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager    although no known window manager directly supports such a feature  which may be equivalent to writing out a xinitrc or xsession file naming the geometry and wmcommand of each application but olvwm may have something  close  there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for although it is not as complete as the sunview program toolplaces  look for the application xplaces on an archiveserver near you there are  several versions of this program floating around look for a recent vintage 0000

whereverusrbinx00yourfavoritewm    you can turn autorepeat on or off by using xset r onoff the x protocol however doesnt provide for varying the autorepeat rate which is a capability not supported by all systems some servers running on systems that support this however may provide commandline flags to set the rate at startup time if you have control over  server startup see the man pages for xinit and xdm you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings for example you can start the xsun server  from mit with the options ar0 000 ar0 00 to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard    there is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key the xmodmap client which is useful  for moving your ctrl and esc keys to useful places just rearranges keys and  does not do macro expansion some few clients including xterm and several xbased editors  accept a translation resource such as xtermvt000translations override  keyf0 stringsetenv display unix0 which permits the shorthand f0 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm it takes effect for new xterm clients to include control characters in the string use nnn where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include window managers which could provide this facility do not yet nor has a special remapper client been made available    david b lewis

the file can be postprocessed into something useful or printed with the xpr  client and your local printing mechanism you can use this command csh sleep 00 xwd root  outputxwd  and then spend 00 seconds or so setting up your screen the entire current display will be saved into the file outputxwd note that xwd also has an undocumented before r0 id flag for specifying the window id on the  commandline there are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for  specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture  two publiclyavailable programs which allow interactive definition of  arbitrary portions of the display and builtin delays are asnap and xgrabsc there are several versions of xgrabsc version 00 available on export 000 is the most recent xsnap includes some asnap

facility imageprocessing and support for postscript and  nonpostscript printers  some vendors implementations of x eg decwindows and openwindows  include session managers or other desktop programs which include print portion of screen or take a snapshot options some platforms also have tools which  can be used to grab the framebuffer directly the sun systems for example  have a screendump program which produces a sun raster file some x terminals  have local screendump utilities to write postscript to a local serial printer  some vendors implementations of lpr eg sony include direct  support for printing xwd files but youll typically need some other package  to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer    if you need color postscript in particular you can   grab the screenimage using a program which can produce color  postscript such as xgrabsc and xv   grab the screenimage using xwd and postprocess xwd into color ps you can do this using xwd0ps or the xtops program from the imagemagick  distribution the pbmplus package is also good for this as is the xim package    this cant be done unless the x server has been extended consider  instead a systemdependent mechanism for eg  capturing the framebuffer    the likeliest program is an incarnation of jef poskanzers useful  portable bitmap toolkit which includes a number of programs

material from larry carroll larrycpoejplnasagov 000    the solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar a solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell echo esc0textg where esc is the escape key text is the string you wish to have displayed and g is a controlg the bel character  here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories alias newcd cd  echo n esc0cwdg  the digit 0 in these strings indicates to xterm that it should  change only the title of the window to change both the title and the name  used in the icon use the digit 0 instead and use 0 to change only the  icon name  note another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified cd is used in a subshell is to wrap the escape sequences into the ps0 prompt itself  note on an ibm rs0000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a v    the best source of such information is in your r0 sources in the file  ctlseqsms a postscript version is in mithardcopyclientsctlseqspsz  oreillys volume 0 the x users guide includes an r0 version of the control  sequences the standard volume will be available 000 and a motif version of  the book is available now the current r0 guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences 000  other good sources of information include the r0 version of that document and also the file in the r0 sources called mitclientsxtermctlseq0txt a  compilation put together by skip montanaro ge crd listing the vt000  sequences it dates from r0 but is fairly accurate  a hardcopy version was  published in the december 0000 xnextevent the xug newsletter  in a pinch a vt000 manual will do  last updated 0000     in order to use special characters such as the oumlaut you need to  stty pass0 but also to use a charcell iso0000 font such as  xtermfont mediumrnormal000ciso00000 xtermboldfontboldrnormal000ciso00000 the family is intentionally unspecified in this example  in addition you may want to set this in your shell setenv lcctype iso00000          for a given character above 000 you can determine the key to use with  the alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 000 try using man ascii for example oumlaut v is altv and the section character   is alt   thanks to greg holmberg gregthirdiuunetuunet and stephen gildea  gildeaexpolcsmitedu 000    you are probably setting the geometry small accidentally if you give  a resource specification like this xtermgeometry 00x00 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 00x00 for the main window this is ok as it uses characters for its size  but its popup menus dont they are in pixels and show up small to set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly xtermvt000geometry 00x00    you could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command  however a program by richard hesketh rlh0ukcacuk specifically for  manipulating the selection will help eg   xselection primary  lpr finds the primary selection and prints it this command can be placed in a  windowmanager menu or in shellscripts xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties a version is on export also available is riaccsuwocapubxgetselectiontarz which can be adapted to do this    you can use several environment variables to control how resources are  loaded for your xtbased programs  xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and  xapplresdir  these environment variables control where xt looks for  applicationdefaults files as an application is initializing  xt loads at most one appdefaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath  set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a  way that appdefaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies suppose for example that you are running suns open windows and you also  have some r0 x applications installed in usrlibx00appdefaults you could  set a value like this for xfilesearchpath and it would cause xt to look up  appdefaults files in both usrlibx00 and usropenwinlib or wherever your openwinhome is located setenv xfilesearchpath usrlibx00tnopenwinhomelibtn  the value of this environment variable is a colonseparated list of pathnames  the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see  xtresolvepathname          n      the value of the filename parameter or the                 applications class name         t      the value of the file type  in this case the                 literal string appdefaults         c      customization resource r0 only         s      suffix  none for appdefaults         l      language locale and codeset eg jajpeuc         l      language part of l  eg ja         t      the territory part of the displays language string         c      the codeset part of the displays language string  lets take apart the example  suppose the applications class name is  myterm also suppose open windows is installed in usropenwin notice the  example omits localespecific lookup usrlibx00tn        means usrlibx00appdefaultsmyterm openwinhomelibtn    means usropenwinlibappdefaultsmyterm  as the application initializes xt tries to open both of the above  appdefaults files in the order shown  as soon as it finds one it reads it  and uses it and stops looking for others  the effect of this path is to  search first in usrlibx00 then in usropenwin  lets consider another example this time lets set  xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file mytermad in the current working  directory then for myterm in the directory appdefaults setenv xuserfilesearchpath nadhomeappdefaultsn  the first path in the list expands to mytermad  the second expands  to homeappdefaultsmyterm  this is a convenient setting for debugging  because it follows the imake convention of naming the appdefaults file  mytermad in the applications source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly  note when looking for appdefault files with xuserfilesearchpath for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so t and s are useless  with r0 theres another twist  you may specify a customization  resource value  for example you might run the myterm application like this myterm xrm customization color  if one of your pathname specifications had the value usrlibx00tnc then the expanded pathname would be usrlibx00appdefaultsmytermcolor because the c substitution character  takes on the value of the customization resource  the default xfilesearchpath compiled into xt is usrlibx00ltnc  r0 usrlibx00ltnc  r0 usrlibx00tnc     r0 usrlibx00ltn usrlibx00ltn usrlibx00tn  note some sites replace usrlibx00 with a projectroot in this batch of default settings  the default xuserfilesearchpath also compiled into xt is  rootlnc  r0 rootlnc  r0 rootnc     r0 rootln rootln rootn  root is either the value of xapplresdir or the users home directory  if xapplresdir is not set  if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other  than the default xt ignores xapplresdir altogether  notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find  your appdefaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir  to  a single dot  in r0 all this machinery worked differently for r0  compatibilty many people set their xapplresdir value to  a dot followed  by a slash  thanks to oliver jones ojworldstdcom 000    the answer lies in changing xdms xrdb resource in the xdmconfig file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources for example  your usrlibx00xdmxdmconfig file may add the line  displaymanager0authorize false  to permit unrestricted access to the display before login beware and also  displaymanagerxrdbusrlibx00xdmnewxrdb where that file does something for all connections along the lines of binsh comes in with arguments display 0 load usrlibx00xdmxresources usrbinx00xsetroot display 0 bitmap usrlibx00xdmnewbitmap usrbinx00xrdb  substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to taste  note that this is a  general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client  thanks to jay bourland jaybcauchystanfordedu 000    when xdm runs your xsession it doesnt source your cshrc or login files you can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any sh script or you can place all environmentsetting statements in a separate file and source it from both the xsession file and your shell configuration file or if you set your path in your cshrc file the normal place you can make your  xsession have path set simply by making it a csh script ie by starting your xsession file off with bincsh  if this doesnt work also try starting off with binsh  reset path pathcsh c echo path  export path    there are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv display  whenever you log in to another networked unix machine running x one solution is to use the clientsxrsh on the r0 contrib tape  it  includes xrsh a script to start an x application on remote machine and xrlogin a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine a more recent version is on export in xrsh00shar one solution is to use the xrlogin program from der mouse mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu you can ftp caveatemptor versions from 00000000 in xxrloginc and xxrlogindc the program packages up term and display into a single string which is stuffed into term  rlogin then  propagates term normally your cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval xrlogind where xrlogind is a program that checks term and if it is of the special  format it recognizes unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to  recreate the environment variables 0000  in addition if all you need to do is start a remote x process on  another host and you find rsh host n usrbinx00xterm display display  too simple display must have your real hostname then this version of xrsh  can be used to start up remote x processes the equivalent usage would be  xrsh host xterm

postprocessed with pbmplus to design the individual  characters and then to do some large amount of postprocessing to concatenate  them into the bdf format see ollie joness article in the november 00 x  journal for more information the r0 contrib area in fontsutils and in clientsxtroff contained  a number of useful utilities including some to convert between bdf font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor an easier way is to use the xfed client to modify an existing font a version is on the r0 or r0 x00r0 contrib tape in contribclientsxfed xfed is  available for anonymous ftp on ftpinformatikunidortmundde 0000000000  possibly as file pubwindowsxdiversex00sourcenxfedtarz it can produce bdfformat fonts which can be compiled for a variety of x servers the xfedor client from group bull permits creation of bitmaps cursors xpm0 pixmaps and fonts binaries for common machines are on avahiinriafr in pub in addition the sources an old xlib implementation have been placed  000 in exportcontrib  if you are a metafont user you can use mftobdf from the seetex distribution to convert pk gf and pxl fonts to bdf format the distribution is on ftpcscoloradoedu and on exportlcsmitedu the gnu package fontutils00tarz on prepaimitedu includes xbfe a font editor and a number of utilities for massaging font formats the oreilly x resource issue 0 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font fonts can be resized with hiroto kagotanis bdfresize a new version is in ftpcstitechacjpx00contrib    after you have built the font using your systems fontcompiler  installed it in some directory and run mkfontdir or your systems equivalent eg bldfamily for openwindows in that directory be sure to use xset fp  dir to add that full pathname to the servers fontpath or if the  directory is already in the path use xset fp rehash so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found it is this last step that youre probably  leaving out you can also use xset q to make sure that that directory is in  the path sometimes your xset fp dir command fails with a badvalue error x error of failed requestbadvalue integer parameter out of range for operation major opcode of failed request  00 xsetfontpath  this means the x server cannot find or read your font directory or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server  the mention of an integer parameter in the message is spurious   is the font directory youre specifying readable from the servers file    system  remember its the server not the client which interprets your    font directory  trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an    xset command with shell metacharacters in it eg xset fp myfonts and    the server is an x terminal or managed by xdm   is the directory really a font directory  if youre running an mit server    or most varieties of vendor servers look in the directory for the file    fontsdir  if you cant find that file run mkfontdir0  if youre    running openwindows look for the file familieslist  if you cant find    it run bldfamily0   if youre in a site where some people run x00rn servers and others run a    proprietary server with nonstandard font formats openwindows for    example make sure the font directory is right for the server youre using    hint if the directory contains pcf andor snf files it wont work for    open windows  if the directory contains ff andor fb files it wont work    for x00rn  thanks to der mouse mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu and to oliver jones  ojpictelcom 000     a tool called snftobdf 00 is part of the bdftools package which is  available from exportlcsmiteducontribbdftoolstarz and from  crlnmsuedupubmiscbdftoolstarz  000    der mouses getbdf is one solution it connects to a server and  produces a bdf file for any font the server is willing to let it  it can be  used as an anythingtobdf converter but requires access to a server that can  understand the font file thus is both more and less powerful than other tools  such as snftobdf getbdf is on 00000000 in xgetbdfc or available via mail  from mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu 000 in addition the r0 program fstobdf can produce bdf for any font that the r0 server has access to    the decwindows fonts typically dont exist on a nondec installation but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by decwindows applications to standard mit fonts of similar characteristics and size pick up the file  contribdecwindowsonx00r0fontaliases from exportlcsmitedu this file is  for a standard mit r0 server  it can also serve as a starting point for  creating a similar aliases file for the open windows server or other servers  which do not use the mit font scheme    the format of fonts preferred by decs x server is the pcf format you can produce this compiled format from the bdf format by using decs dxfc fontcompiler note that the dec servers can also use raw bdf fonts with a performance hit   i want to be able to do something like this xclockbackgroundpixmap      usrincludex00bitmapsrootweave  you cant do this the backgroundpixmap resource is a pixmap of the  same depth as the screen not a bitmap which is a pixmap of depth 0 because  of this writing a generic string to pixmap converter is impossible since  there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps therefore  neither the x toolkit or the athena widget set define a string to pixmap  converter because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a  resource  the athena widget set does define a string to bitmap converter for  use in many of its widgets however courtesy chris d peterson now kiticscom 000  however a specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of  the xloadimage package by jim frost was posted 0000 by sebastian wangnick  bastiunidoinformatikunidortmundde it permits loading of a number of  image formats as a pixmap  the leading generalpurpose format for pixmaps is the xpm format used  by groupe bull in several of its programs including the gwm window manager by att in its olpixmap editor and by ics in its interface builder xpm  distribution available on export as contribxpmtarz includes readwrite  routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner  see information on the xpmtalk mailing list above xpm 00f was announced in 000 and is available from exportlcsmitedu and avahiinriafr an older version is on  the r0 contrib tape a set of xpm icons collected by anthony

  archivename xfaqpart0 lastmodified 00000000    the release of new public patches by the mit x consortium is announced in the compwindowsxannounce newsgroup  patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which x00 is available they are now also distributed through the  newsgroup compsourcesx some source resellers may be including patches in  their source distributions of x00  people without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server it now has  00 patches for x00r0 000  send to xstuffexpolcsmitedu the subject line send fixes  where  is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch  here are a few complications 0 fix 0 is in four parts you need to request 0a 0b 0c and  0d separately 0 the file sungxuu which was part of an earlier patch was  rereleased with patch 0 note the file doesnt work with solaris 0 fix 0 is in two parts 0a and 0b 0 fix 00 is in three parts 00a 00b and 00c 0 fix 00 is in two parts 00a and 00b 0 fix 00 replaces the r0fixtest0 for the x test suite which  previously was optional 0 fix 00 also needs pexlibtarz which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for pexlibuu0000 0 fix 00 is in 0 parts 00a through 00i    the xstuff server is a mailresponse program that means that you mail  it a request and it mails back the response any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line the xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can  have several different commands in a single message unless you ask for help  the xstuff server treats the subject header line just like any other line  of the message the archives are organized into a series of directories and  subdirectories  each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an  index the toplevel index gives you an overview of what is in the  subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it  0 the command help or send help causes the server to send you a  more detailed version of this help file 0 if your message contains a line whose first word is index then  the server will send you the toplevel index of the contents of the archive if there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then  the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the toplevel index  for example you can say send index fixes or index fixes a message that  requests an index cannot request data 0 if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the xstuff server will send you the items named on the rest of the line to name  an item you give its directory and its name for example                 send fixes 0 0 0a 0b 0 you may issue multiple send requests the xstuff server contains many  safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large  amounts of data the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day if the work queue contains more requests than the  days quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day  whenever the mailer is run to send its days quota it sends the requests out  shortestfirst 0 some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting  return addresses  if you use such a mailer you wont get any response  if  you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like         path foobarbitnetmitvmamitedu or         path barfoofrotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use it  the xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuffexpolcsmitedu if  your mailer deals in  notation try sending to

  tkldcogsciedacuk kevin davidson writes      in my opinion a programming degree is still worth having   yes but a cs degree is not a programming degree does anybody know of a computing course where programming is taught  computer science is a branch of maths or the course i did was  ive also done a software engineering course  much more practical and likely to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think they want but also did not teach programming the ability to program was an entry requirement  try the msc computing science course at the real newcastle university its a conversion course but at least they teach real programming  in the space of 0 months we were taught pascal simula prolog miranda also some basic low level stuff 00000 was covered as well  they also did concurrent programming and operating systems some software engineering plus quite a few optional units including database theory and some stuff about comms     the pascal is to be replaced by cc i think next year  i learnt this and  x windows programming as well anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months  depending on your tastes the selection of skills learnt can be quite wide reaching  the one critiscism i would level at the course which i would have thought invaluable is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry  this would probably need a slightly longer project period say six months but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course  yes i know this sounds like a plug for the course why not  mackem ian

  epsteintrwacsfptrwcom jeremy epstein writes  dmmheadcfaharvardedu david meleedy writes theres a bug in sunos 000 which is alluded to in the faq although there its talking about x00r0 as being affected  you need to force libxmu to be linked statically rather than dynamically which works around the linker error  the simplest thing to do is edit each of the makefiles where theres a failure and change the line which reads xmulib  lxmusrc lxmu to xmulib  lxmusrc bstatic lxmu bdynamic  no this is only relevant for openwindows 0x as shipped with sunos it is not relevant for mit r0 mit r0

much valueadded as possible  to accomplish this we will be putting out a two disk set the first containing whats ready and needed now the second available later in 00 containing more sparc binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks  the sug 00000 disk which was assembled by robert a bruce contains a lot of essential source code and we decided it would be a great service to

  justin kibell jckcattcitrieduau wrote  what has this got to do with compwindowsx    i agree that this is a side track but it is funny that i skip so many other articles threads but i couldnt resist reading this one  my beliefs opinions and expressions are strictly my own and do not represent or reflect any official or unofficial policies or attitudes of any other person or organization   but  i have heard that ford motor company has had a recruiting bias toward engineers and away from computer science graduates  the reasoning is supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements  this is evidenced by the large number of cs people who are employed via contracts and are not brought on board except in special circumstances  this is a generalization which obviously doesnt always hold true but there are statistics  furthermore most software engineering at ford gets done by electrical engineers  i know of 0 univerities that have merged the computer science department and the electrical engineering so that you can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming  but since my beliefs and opinions are merely figments of my distorted imagination i suppose i should keep it to myself

  im writing xwall a simple x version of wall and i want it to put a message up on each of a default list of displays  the problem is that xopendisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently controlled by xdm login screen   xdm does xgrabserver when its running in secure mode so do some screenlocks  theres really no simple way to tell this is the case  you can take xdm out of secure mode  probably not too cool  you can wrap your call to xopendisplay in some code which solicts a future sigalrm and longjmps past the xopendisplay from the signal handler  an example of this can be seen in the xdm sources  note that longjmping out of xopendisplay probably causes a memory leak  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit  regularly  
       im doing a study on what the following type of users would like to   have on a unix manager  basically im looking for the unix commands   and features on motif window interface which will help the different   type of users make use of unix      personally i cant stand motif  i also cant stand gui      command line  interfaces for things like access to the commands i know      command line  and love  i think youll find that experience sic users    command line    der mouse     a year and a half ago i felt the same way  the i started using gooyies  give me the command line when something out of the ordinary needs done and the gooy when i am doing normal or repative work  note that most operations are repetative  hackers love cls because     what i like about guis   the ability to view and manipulate a group of objects files   text directories etc and and manipulate them in some way   such as delete copy paste rename    the ability to have several applications  screens visible   and accessable at the same time   being able to do a standard set of functions easily and   quickly on an unfamiliar operating system i am familiar with   the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally   i will have to some work on a system that i almost never use   if it has a gui i can usually accomplish what i want to do   fairly easily the command line on the other hand often is   a long and painful experience   what i hate about guis   having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard i guess   i have a strong onehanded preference i like to use a   computer with one hand and use the other for holding something   like a piece of paper of a mug of tea i have configured my   favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be   done with one hand such as navigating cutting pasting   searching opening and saving files etc the main thing i   need to use both hands for is entering text  i guess i need to get one of those mice with like 00 buttons or something and then i will have the best of both worlds  brent

  can anyone recomend a good book or article on interclient communications besides iccm  ive looked everywhere i can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it but nobody shows you how  oreilly has no examples iccm has no examples asente  swick give no examples  in fact most of the books ive looked at if they discuss icc at all simply give a condensed version of the iccm and then refer you to the iccm  i did find one example of how to use atoms and  properties in youngs book and five hours after i bought youngs book i had my applications talking to each other  i am not sure however if thats the best way  id like to stay independent  of unix so pipes andor sockets probably arent the way to go  but within x one can also use messages the clipboard and perhaps window groups  i need a text that discusses the various methods discusses which method is best for which purpose and gives examples  without examples its all just words  thanks in advance  ross  
  well i am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask but let me try anyway i am running xterm and like all unix users i run man something recently i switched to solaris 00 and their man pages are littered with i directives that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm the resulting output admittedly a personal taste is very annoying to look at back when i was using sunos 000 i remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with underlining  so my question is how do i change the xterms behaviour under i directives  for nroff man pages to perhaps underlining or at least disabling it b  directives are fine i like them and of course i dont want to go in and edit the man pages inputs somehow xterm allows one to specify both a normal font and a bold font but not an italic font  any pointers suggestions are greatly appreciated thanks  john  ps running xterm rv wont work i tried

   you are right to be going motif rather than openlook  sun has just recently seen the light and dumped their commitment to openlook  in the announcement they stated they have no future plans for devguide  this is incorrect  sun has made no such claim regarding devguide and as  manager of the devguide engineering group i can state with authority that work on devguide is continuing apace  we had quite a strong show of interest from the devguide user community at last weeks solaris developers conference devguide is being advocated not only as a valuable future builder tool but as an important bit of transition technology that will help sustain current customers and facilitate their migration to the cose desktop environment  if you have specific questions about devguide availability etc you can  contact tali aben our devguide product marketing person at 000 0000000  david bryant devguide manager sunsoft

please see the x faq for complete details   window managers     there are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different   features and abilities  the choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features  at this   point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager     a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger   is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move   also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   windows                           joe english joetrysteroartcom    ive found that a good font for tiling is 0x00 aka   miscfixedmediumrnormal00000000000c00iso00000  it is   the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun 0000x000 screen   and still get two 00 column terminal windows sidebyside on the   display with no overlap  other font suggestions will be accepted   the x server   which server          make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware   if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x00 server    on my monochrome sun i havent noticed much difference between   the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it was pointed out to   me that xsunmono is about 000k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging             thanks to jonny farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk                         michael salmon michaelsalmoneosericssonse     how your server was compiled can also make a difference  jeff law   lawschirfcsutahedu advises us that on a sun system x should be   compiled with gcc version 0 or with the unbundled sun compiler   you can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not   using the bundled sunos compiler  i assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other highquality commercial   compilers on the market  locking the server into ram                  has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and   does not get paged  eg via a call to plock  does this help   performance at all  ive had one inquiry on this topic and a few   pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone   whos tried it  i am not in a position to give it a try     thanks to eric c claeys eccepermattcom       danny backx dbsunbimbe       juan d martin juandocnmuses  starting your server              joe english joetrysteroartcom      if you start up a lot of clients in your xsession or whatever sleep     for a second or two after launching each one  after i changed my     xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time     we have a heavily loaded system without much core though    this sounds crazy but i have confirmed that it works      warner losh impsolbournecom provided me with a good explanation of   why this works which i have summarized here      when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections  a lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts  this process touches a large number of     pages  any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory  if you     put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up      similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x     client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources     being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so     forth  all this activity is typically memory intensive  once this     initialization is done the process has reached a steady state     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages     by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstations limited resources    this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation as there   are so many variables to be considered available ram local swap   space load average number of users on your system which clients   you are starting etc    currently in my xinitrc i have a situation like sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm      ive experimented with sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm      ive even tried sleep 0 exec startxclientsscript     and then in startxclientsscript i had sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm         the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my xinitrc and had settled down     into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched     all of these yielded fairly comparable results and so i just stuck with   my current setup for its simplicity  you will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you  fonts      loading fonts takes time and ram  if you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use youll get speed increases in loadup time    one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one   large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients  or   at least all your heavily used clients  to use only those few fonts   client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server  this will also conserve server resources since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server        farrell mckay fbmptcburpptcbuozau         joe english joetrysteroartcom     eg my main xterm font is 0x00 so i also have twm set up to use 0x00   in all its menus and icons etc  twms default font is 0x00  since   i dont normally use 0x00 ive eliminated one font from my server    oliver jones ojroadrunnerpictelcom     keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs     if you will make extensive use of r0 scalable fonts use a font server  about the resources file                   keep your xresources  xdefaults file small  saves ram and saves     on server startup time          joe english joetrysteroartcom    one suggestion      in your xdefaults xresources file try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications  for example  reversevideo true      then separate your resources into individual clientspecific     resource files  for example homelibappdefaults  in your     login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath  setenv xuserfilesearchpath homelibappdefaultsn       the compwindowsx frequently asked questions faq contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work     ed      so when xterm launches it loads its resources from     appdefaultsxterm  xdvi finds them in appdefaultsxdvi     and so on and so forth  note that not all clients follow the same     xxxxx resourcefile naming pattern  you can check in your system     appdefaults directory often usrx00r0libx00appdefaults to     find the proper name and then name your personal resource files     with the same name      this is all documented in the xt specification pg 000  000     thanks to kevin samborn sambornmtkgccom          michael urban urbancobrajplnasagov              and mike long mikeleecornelledu      kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers    this method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits       easier to maintain  more usable       fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resourcemanager       property  as a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker since it doesnt have to load all your resources       applications only process their own resources never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them    it also has drawbacks       the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up  this doesnt seem to       make that much of a performance difference and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability  if you are modifying an       applications resource database you just need to rerun the       application without having to xrdb again       xrdb will by default run your xdefaults file through cpp  when       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs they will not       watch out for this        i had c style comments in my xdefaults file which cpp stripped       out  when i switched to this method of distributed resource       files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources  xt did not       provide any error message when it encountered the c style       comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted       processing the resource file        the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy eg ifdef       color  is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management       you may also run into some clients which break the rules  for       example neither emacs 00000 nor xvt 00 will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in xdefaults       when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored your client       will not find its resources  loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources            casey leedom caseygaussllnlgov    a possible compromise suggestion that i have and am planning on trying   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my   xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for   clients that i seldom use  define your display properly                   client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server  in   that situation rather than setting your display environment variable to    hostname00 where hostname is the name of your workstation you   should set your display variable to unix00 or 00  by doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests thanks to patrick j horgan pjh00rasamdahlcom    see the display names section of the x0 man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name    i dont think its stock mit but at least data general and hp have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the display isnt set specially       rob sartin 00opensisartinuunetuunet    jody goldberg jodyalgorithmicscom sent me an xlib patch to change   stock r0 to use local communication even if display is not properly set   i dont want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   nonmit patches and so have elected not to include it here  hopefully mit   will apply this minor 0 lines patch themselves  in the meantime if   you want to try it yourself email jody  ed   clients     if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running  think also   about the kind of programs you are running  for example  is there   a smaller clock program than xclock    unfortunately i havent really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word     suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   eg xclock xterm xbiff are welcome  ed    ive received some contradictory advice from people on the subject   of x client programs  some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly xlib based since xt xaw and other toolkits are rather   large  others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries  in   this case using a nonxt for example client program may actually   increase the amount of ram consumed    the upshot of all this seems to be dont mix toolkits  that is try   and use just athena clients or just xview clients or just motif   clients etc  if you use more than one then youre dragging in   more than one toolkit library    know your environment and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment

suggested by richard hesketh rlh0ukcacuk     available exportlcsmitedu in contribxvt00tarz     if you dont need all the esoteric features of xterm then get    hold of xvt   it was written here just to save swap space as    xterm is rather a hog      this was written as a partial clone of xterm  you dont have to    rename your resources as xvt pretends to be xterm  in its current    version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm  ive heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature but ive not found any    yet     update march 0000  i recently had a few email conversations with    brian warkentin brianwarkentineengsuncom regarding xvt  he    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm  for    instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling    speed try this quickie benchmark bintime dd ifetctermcap    bs00 and see which program can scroll faster  also while xterm    may be slightly larger in ram requirements we dont have any hard    numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterms paging requirements are not that major     as an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it    made little difference since if you never use it it never gets    brought into memory     so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm  in summary  caveat emptor your mileage may vary    if you can provide some hard data id like to see it    specifically how much ram each occupies how much swap each needs    relative speed of each  0 mterm    suggested

people like it anyway   tuning your client              suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster    from scott barman scottasdcom comes a suggestion regarding motif   text field widgets      i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets i     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes     particularly the initial one in the field  examining the what was     going on with xscope i found it  it seems that when the resource     xmnblinkrate is nonzero and the focus is on a text field widget     or even just a text widget the ibeam cursor will blink     every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the     widget code is making a request to the server copyarea  the user     can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to 0  it is not     noticeable on a 00mhz sparc but it does make a little difference     on a slower system    this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas  consider your heavily used clients are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server   requests   miscellaneous suggestions   pretty pictures           dont use large bitmaps gifs etc as root window backgrounds     the more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc     these take up ram and cpu power  i work on a sun sparc and im     conscious of performance issues i cant comprehend it when i see     people with a 0mb sun 000 running xphoon as their root window      ill let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation     if youre anything like me you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway         thanks to qiang alex zhao azhaocsarizonaedu  for reminding me of this one ed  a quicker mouse           using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse  i use xset m 0 00 in my xinitrc file   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist  see the xset man page for further ideas and information    hint sometimes you may want to slow down your mouse tracking for   fine work  to cover my options i have placed a number of different   mouse

things you can do  some that stick out       for motif programs dont set xmfontlist resources for individual       buttons labels lists et al use the defaultfontlist or       labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highestlevel manager       widget  again stick to as few fonts as possible       better yet dont use motif at all  its an absolute pig       dont create and destroy widgets on the fly  try to reuse them       this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too       use a line width of 0 in gcs  on some servers this makes a huge       difference       compress and collapse multiple expose events  this can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one    francois staes franskiwiuiaacbe      just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily they suggested trying     out the gnuy malloc but i didnt find the time yet i did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the     differences were indeed very noticeable  somewhat 0 times faster     any confirmation on this from anyone  ed    andre beck andrebeckirsinftudresdende      unnecessary noexpose events      most people use xcopyareaxcopyplane as fastest blit routines but     they forget to reset graphicsexposures in the gc used for the     blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most     cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through its eventloop again and again     thousands of xchangegc requests      this gfx context switching is also seen in most handcoded xapps     where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed     again and again  xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching     and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters this will     remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the     connection by moving it toward the

your server when you run it on the same machine  not really a     major problem except that the x00 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing    timothy h panton thpwesthawkuucp      firstly it relies on the fact that most cpus are mostly idle xs     cpu usage is bursty  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpuintensive at the same time is small if they     are not then you get twice the cpumemory available for your     action      the second factor is that context switches are expensive using 0     cpus halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network typically 00k vs 0k for a pipe allowing     even fewer context

  hello     when starting bx if you recieve an error message saying cannot load appdefaults file check your xapplresdir environment variable and then put the file builderxcessory   this is the appdefaults file for bx  in the directory specified by the xuserfilesearchpath environment variable     if you dont have an xuserfilesearchpath environment variable then set xuserfilesearchpath to be the directory where the builderxcessory file is you can do this using the setenv command under csh note that the name ends in ad so you will have to set xuserfilesearchpath to bxnad to get the appdefaults to load correctly     to make sure the the appdefaults file can be read by all the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the appdefaults file exists in usrlibx00appdefaults or  usropenwinlibappdefaults depending on how your system is set up     once you have taken care of this set the systemdirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed bx  for example lets say ive installed bx in t then my system directory resource should be set like this   systemdirectory tbuilderxcessory      thanks       ics tech support

       let me point out that both guibased wordprocessors and textbased    formatters both have a language one happens to be mouse and    actionbased and the other symbolbased  true but thats beside the point this is a fact about an abstract model of what the gui users are doing not about what they actually are doing this abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a programmer of the system nb some users may see it too but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer  im not saying that the programmers perspective is evil or stunted after all thats what i do too i am saying that ui designers must carefully distinguish between the userprogrammer conceptual models and they must ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system       i dont recall the actual stats but something like 0 in 0 people can be    categorized as a symbol manipulator  it would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim at any rate i dont think this is evidence that 00 of users think like programmers bankers financial analysts structural engineers  these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation but what they do is not programming and programming is not required to do what they do   to restate my previous point yes users want to build their own solutions no they do not want to do programming to accomplish this

  i am trying to figure out the current c toolkit directions more simply id like to know which c toolkit to bet on  for use in a new long term project  i have the same problem  i have looked at motif wwl interviews gina and a few variations on the above  ive also done a cursory examination of rogue waves viewh  i like viewhs abstractions best of all of the toolkits i mentioned but the resulting code looks little like motif and i have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code  gina allows you to write code which looks a great deal like motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance but the resulting code is almost too motiflike and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent c code  interviews looks promising but i havent found a free version with motif support and im not confident how widely interviews with motif support will be adopted and what if any specific motif support will be available over time  the other libraries produce code which is less motiflike but which does not make sufficient use of the features of c to simplify my coding task  at this point my inclination is to write my motif manipulation routines in c and invoke those routines from my c code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task  later if osf or some credible standardssetting body comes up with a c interface to motif i will change to that  it does me no goo to write in c if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions  its better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now  viewsh is the only library id consider right now but in our environment wed end up spending nearly 0000 to use it and i cant justify it when its likely to cause shortterm productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is unlikely to be a sufficiently longlived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the j curve   brad   brad daniels  if money cant buy happiness danielsneosoftcom   i guess ill have to rent it i dont work for neosoft and weird al yenkovic dont speak for my employer

  berryduriancitruqozau andrew berry writes  my impression is that most people use motif because their os vendor supplies it with x sunos users excluded and because it is similar in look and feel to mswindows and os0 pm  personally i also prefer the look and feel of motif no flames please  just an opinion  seeing as motif has been adopted by sun ibm hp  cant remeber the other members in the recent announcement im sure youll see it on virtually every workstation ie sun ibm hp and dec must make up the vast majority of all hardware   i am also concerned by this prevalence of motif particularly from the point of view of writing and obtaining free software  as the linux and 000bsd communities grow however i think that motif will lose some of its grip at least in the noncommercial marketplace     ports of motif to both 000bsd and linux are available for a fee of about 000  this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to redistribute  the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups pertaining to motif has been high   i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial and noncommercial software ie you will only get free software using athena or openlook widget sets and only get commercial software using the motif widget sets     i cant see why  if just about every workstation will come with motif by default and you can buy it for under 000 for the free unix platforms i cant see this causing major problems   side note   all the x based code i am writing and will distribute freely when completed is based on motif because from a programmatic and also look and feel point of view i like it the best no flames on this one please    bambi                                      david j hughes     bambibuozau                                                                senior network programmer                              comms development  operation                     australia  00 00 000000

  hello motif world  a few days ago i posted my announcement for an update of motif i got several requests to send the bindings per email and i know of several people who have been using motif and there are probably a number of people i am not aware of who are also using motif  my question is  how many people out there would be interested to join a mailinglist where people can ask questions about motif swap stories and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings this would benefit the usercommunity as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to motif motif is still very much a voluntary project and this way i can make a list of priorities in what order things should be added or changed  if youre interested in joining such a mailinglist please take the time to reply to this message and tell me so when there is sufficient interest say about 00 people or more a mailinglist will be set up at my site and i will post the announcement of the newlycreated list to this and other newsgroups   ronald van loon      in theory there is no difference  rvlooncvruunl   between theory and practice 0dcv group utrecht     the netherlands      in practice however there is

  hello everybody  i have a little question  due to more features pex dragdrop many applications when linked with for example motif 00 instead motif 00 need more memory in the xserver xterminals only have limited memory normally no swapping possible so my question  is there a possibility to determine via x protocol calls the size of free memory available to the xserver  so one can determine for example whether to start a pex application with the css on client side or on server side when there is enough memory  please reply via email ill summarize  sincerly         matthias        matthias pfuetzner    work  00 0000 000000   home 00 0000 00000     0000 darmstadt frg  zgdv wilhelminenstrasse 0  lichtenbergstrasse 00       pfuetznerigdfhgde pfuetznerzgdvdauucp      keith packard said       r0 is different from r0 thats why we changed the release number

     i am also concerned by this prevalence of motif particularly from the  point of view of writing and obtaining free software  as the linux and  000bsd communities grow however i think that motif will lose some of  its grip at least in the noncommercial marketplace      ports of motif to both 000bsd and linux are available for a fee of about  000  this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to  redistribute  the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups  pertaining to motif has been high    i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial  and noncommercial software ie you will only get free software using  athena or openlook widget sets and only get commercial software using  the motif widget sets      i cant see why  if just about every workstation will come with motif  by default and you can buy it for under 000 for the free unix  platforms i cant see this causing major problems      i think you will find that the active linux and 000bsd communities are   populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying any money for software   otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial unix   an important factor in the linux community is that source code is always   available this is probably similar in the 000bsd community however im not   really involved there many people using linux like to stay at the cutting   bleeding edge ie when kernel patches c library or compiler patches come   out people like to rebuild their entire systems the prime requirement for   all linux software is that it is available under a gnu style public license   hence linux software uses either the athena widgets or xview   individuals may write software requiring motif but i doubt it is widely   adopted  regards  richard gooch

  mike bell writes   apologies for those who have read this before but noone has solved this    one yet so im posting again sorry                                       im having problems creating a cursor bigger than 00x00 im using motif 00  x00r0 running hpux 000  all the functions return valid results but no  cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size i tried    using the following code    unsigned int wh  xquerybestcursorxtdisplayprogramarea xtwindowprogramarea 00 00 w  h    to return the nearest size to what i require however it returns 00 and 00 as  the width and height respectively what am i doing wrong and if not how can i  get round the problem  does the workstation youre using have hardware cursor support  or does the server generate a software cursor  you can generally tell the difference just by using it  if the cursor blinks a lot when theres screen activity its probably a software cursor  if it has a hardware cursor i think youre probably battling a bug in hps x server  im not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 00x00  its quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it  i vaguely recall that very old mit server revisions did just  that  in reality youre probably stuck with a 00x00 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns  joel

  richard gooch writes    really involved there many people using linux like to stay at the cutting   bleeding edge ie when kernel patches c library or compiler patches come   out people like to rebuild their entire systems the prime requirement for   all linux software is that it is available under a gnu style public license   hence linux software uses either the athena widgets or xview   individuals may write software requiring motif but i doubt it is widely   adopted  shameless plug  the xaw0d widgets make athena a much nicer alternative than the stock mit athena code  mike     michael j oconnor             internet  mjofmsrl0srlfordcom  ford motor company opeo        uucp      fmsrl0opeomjo  00000 rotunda bldg 00000     phone     0 000 0000000  dearborn mi  00000             fax       0 000 0000000

    berryduriancitruqozau andrew berry writes   ports of motif to both 000bsd and linux are available for a fee of about  000  this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to  redistribute  the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups  pertaining to motif has been high      i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial  and noncommercial software ie you will only get free software using  athena or openlook widget sets and only get commercial software using  the motif widget sets        i cant see why  if just about every workstation will come with motif  by default and you can buy it for under 000 for the free unix  platforms i cant see this causing major problems    let me add another of my concerns yes i can buy a port of motif for cheap but i cannot get the source for cheap hence i am limited to using whatever x libraries the motif port was compiled against at least with older versions of motif i have been told that motif 00 can be used with any x but i have not seen it myself    currently i have x00r0 running on eight different unix platforms of which only three came with motif on those three i am unable to use the x00r0 libraries to build motif clients because i get link errors between the vendorsupplied port of motif and my x00r0 i anticipate having this same problem when x00r0 becomes available    the result is that i cannot build motif clients that rely on x00r0 since i do not have motif compiled under x00r0 true i could buy another port of motif but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free doesnt it      cheers      tom mcconnell    tom mcconnell               internet tmcconnesedonaintelcom  intel corp c000          phone 0000000000  0000 w chandler blvd  the opinions expressed are my own no one in   chandler az  00000     their right mind would claim them

     you seem to be a little confused  the socialistic hackers who yell  about proprietary software are hardly enamored of motif which is just  as objectionable to that mindset as news is    if i might wear my socialistic hacker hat for a moment i tar news and  motif with the same brush and that brush is not technical   begging everyones pardon i was not slamming motif nor was i necessarily  pluggingflaming the two  i was responding to the sweet blithe statement in  rick000000000digibd from rickdigibddigibdcom rick richardson  rick this is one area where microsoft nt has a big advantage  since rick they control the whole show there are no issues like this where rick licensees create incompatible defacto standards  this happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works and they believe that others will also be happy to use it  i remember when sunview was hot stuff and am not by that statement endorsing sun and its products this is just my experience and when openwindows became hot stuff that was when i started hearing as mentioned before the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying  anything that was deemed proprietary including openwindows  i mentioned motif in the same breath because that is what sun has decided to turn its attention to not because i hate it  mr richardsons position i believe is a healthy one and i am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy nt if it ever shows up wanting instead everything to be free and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are  no de facto standards  it was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds  mrs henne

    i am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system  in keeping with more classic command and control type systems we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on its own monitor   i have a number of x level questions regarding this  we are devloping on unix systems using xmotif platform will be  predominantly suns probably with ports to rs0000 as well  i am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one x display and multiple screens and not multiple x displays   given this   is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other  theres nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between screens   do i have to run separate window managers on the separate screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there what are they who sells them   is a multiscreen window manager the only way i can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next   is there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screens as one logical xy plane or does the hardware only provide for each screen to start at 00   any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a system capable of using either multiple screens or a single screen perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screens instead   i am assuming that this is not a major issue  that i can rely on providing config files which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application  any thoughts or suggestions from past experience are more than welcome    jo pelkey                                   phone 0000000000 battelle pacific northwest labs             fax   0000000000 mail stop k000                             email jepelkeypnlgov po box 000 richland wa  00000    
  gday  windows nt is a step forward but not by much i guess for dos users who think multitasking is really neat add puke here and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 00k of memory its a major improvement for windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most unix users take for  granted most of  windows users only use pcs for text processing or running  0rdparty applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue my ideal operating system  binary compatible across all plaforms it should recognize binaries and configure on the fly so i dont have to have binmac bindos bindec binsun binhp etc  multicpu so i can use the cpus on my pc and ws and mac  and transputers and dsps i dont know a single site which  has gone for a single vendor i am not going to tradein  00mflops per h0 transputer or ultrafast fft on dsp chips note nt runs on symmetric multicpu systems  builtin portable guigraphics tools you can call drawbutton  or drawline and it does the same thing no matter what platform  or display it should also translate graphics commands onthefly so i can use pc graphics sw on my workstation and x software on   my pc i think guis are not just nice to have but essential  configurable frontend so you can make it look like unix or dos or nt or os0 and run shell scripts or commandbat files  object oriented so i can program easily under it and not have to reinvent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch or my application needs to access sourceobject code on the fly  in other words it should have some ai capability that and a tight clean kernel so you can actually understand it anyone know of something like this   adios      ata     mail          dr ata etemadi blackett laboratory                                          space and atmospheric physics group                                          imperial college of science technology and medicine          internetarpanetearnbitnet ataespvaphicacuk or atacmssluclacuk    span                              spvaatae       or     msslcatae

    given a program running on a workstation with an x based window  system how can one pop the window in which it is running to the top  by window i mean the terminal window from which it was invoked  one cant  the application may not have been started from a terminal emulator if it was the terminal emulator may not still exist and if it does it may be in no condition to be popped to the top eg it may be iconified  and even if you can it may not do what you want  consider a virtualroot window manager like tvtwm with the relevant window in a portion of the virtual desktop thats outside the real desktop  some but not all x terminal emulators provide environment variables giving a window id  even if such a thing is present in the environment it may not be what you want it may correspond to a window on a different server for example  der mouse  mousemcrcimmcgilledu  
    ive seen a lot of different terms which seem to mean the same  thing  who can give an exact definition what these terms mean    multiscreen   multiheaded   multidisplay   xserver zaphod mode  as applied to servers the first three are fuzzy terms  multiheaded tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors sometimes even multiple screens even if theyre multiplexed onto the same monitor eg a sun with a cg0 display  multiscreen and multidisplay would if taken strictly mean different things but since the strict meaning of multidisplay would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers when its used it probably refers to the same thing multiscreen would a system that provides multiple screens  zaphod is a term applied to the way the mit server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen   is there a limit how many screensdisplays a single server can handle  in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 00   there is a protocol limitation that restricts a given display to at most 000 screens  i know of no server that handles multiple displays on a single invocation unless possibly my kludges to the r0 server can be looked upon as such on a tcpbased system there is necessarily a limit of 00000 displays per machine but this is not a limitation inherent to x  what you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation probably the mit one  if it claimed there was a limit of 00 inherent to x the author of the article had no business writing about x  der mouse  mousemcrcimmcgilledu  
    i am using an x server that provides 0 visuals pseudocolor 0 bit  truecolor 00 bit and directcolor 00 bit  lucky dog    a problem occurs when i try to create a window with a visual that is  different from the visual of the parent which uses the default  visual which is tc00   in the xlib reference guide from o reilly one can read in the  section about xcteatewindow something like      in the current implementation of x00 when using a visual other      than the parents be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap      which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or      else a badmatch occurs   this warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer  editions of the x00r0 guides  it applies with equal force to earlier versions  presumably only recently did the authors decide it was important enough to mention the necessity it refers to has always been there but its been implicit in the way createwindow requests default some attributes of the new window   however even if i pass along a suitable colourmap i still get a  badmatch when i create a window with a nondefault visual     attrcolormap  cmap    win  xcreatewindow             copyfromparent        border width             0                     depth             inputoutput           class             vinfovisual          visual             cwcolormap            attr            this is because the warning you read is incomplete  you have to provide not only a colormap but also a border  the default border is copyfromparent which is not valid when the windows depth doesnt match its parents  specify a borderpixmap of the correct depth or a borderpixel and the problem should go away  there is another problem i cant find anything to indicate that copyfromparent makes any sense as the borderwidth parameter to xcreatewindow  your xlib implementation probably defines copyfromparent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the xlib implementation not providing stricter typechecking  to be fair im not entirely certain its possible for xlib to catch this  der mouse  mousemcrcimmcgilledu  
    is there a possibility to determine via x protocol calls the size of  free memory available to the xserver  no  even if you could the answer could be out of date even before you get it even if you grab the server it could be taken up by buffering user actions  you should just try to do whatever you want a badalloc error is your indication that insufficient server memory is available  der mouse  mousemcrcimmcgilledu  
   distribution comp  please dont misuse newsgroup hierarchy names as distributions    i wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area  of its childs  yes but its not an attribute of the window its an attribute of the gc used to do the drawing  set the subwindowmode to includeinferiors rather than the default clipbychildren  der mouse  mousemcrcimmcgilledu

  stan kerr writes  when some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows  are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly forcing the server  to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors it doesnt happen  i have the exact same problem when running hewlett packards microwave design system mds from an hp 000 unix box and running macx 00 sys 000 normally mds draws a window with a deep blue backround but occasionally it becomes a light blue and all the text etc inside the window become washed out nearly invisible i thought that it was just something brain dead that i was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or init  by slightly moving the window and forcing a redraw the colors get corrected  harry wolfson wolfsonllmitedu

  id like to compile x00r0 on a sony nws0000 running news 00c  the x distribution has support for this config and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine  but also in the release notes nothing from sony is listed under the supported servers  what am i supposed to use for my r0 x server then  how can the os be supported but not the hardware is there something in the r0 binaries that can be used as the r0 server these may seem like silly questions but im really confused   mikehopperacsvirginiaedu   i will not raise taxes on the middle class unknown  
  heres what i think have figured out  all i need to do is install the r0 disitribution without the xserver like the sonycf file defines and all the new libraries utils etc will be installed and my old server from r0 will still work  this will allow me to run xview 00 and have x00r0 up and running  does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs  another question is it likely that since sun is dropping ow support that the desktop utils like the file manager will be made public it would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets    mikehopperacsvirginiaedu   i will not raise taxes on the middle class unknown  
    forgive me if this is a faq i have checked the list but i cant find it  i have a problem with the cursor within xterm on mono not grayscale monitors the problem is that when i have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field  the solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block but how do you do this i cant find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done  when the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block this would also be preferable but i cant seem to force this to be the default either  configuration is   motorola 00k x00r0  please reply by email if poss  thank you      steve weet  european mis  motorola cellular subscriber group beechgreen court chineham basingstoke hants england phone  00 0000 000000  email  stevewchinehameurocsgmotcom fax    00 0000 000000  mobile   00 0000 000000  post  w00000        steve weet  european mis  motorola cellular subscriber group beechgreen court chineham basingstoke hants england phone  00 0000 000000  email  stevewchinehameurocsgmotcom   fax    00 0000 000000  mobile   00 0000 000000  post  w00000

   hi folks  as part of my selfintroduction to x ive been trying to do some simple icon animation sort of like icondoit from mswindows  changing your own applications icon is fairly simple  if you have a widget id you can just xtsetvalues on xtniconifypixmap or whatever and youre done alternately you can set window manager hints  these methods dont seem to work with icons which your application doesnt specifically own  in my situation i have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in  my icon box so my question is  given a windowid how do you change the icon pixure   a working example would be very much appreciated  if it makes any difference im using motif 00 on vms t000ke  thanks  scott   
  contentsproblems with table widgets in r0  the following part of a program an user interface for a simulation system did work in r0 but refused to in r0 of cause the r0version did not know about the

and height of zero  thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the width and height of the newly created widget to zero no wonder xtpopup or xtmanage child create zero width or

     actually i must also ask the faqs 0 most popular reason why graphics    dont show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your    rectangle  suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics  a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea  or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the window is mapped  the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is visible and mapped  do you know the best way to tickle a window so that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item  
   hessswt0informatikunihamburgde writes   i wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area of  its childs if it is not then how could it be possible to implement a   rubberband across multiple xwindows to select the objects that are  displayed one in each window  use a gc with the subwindowmode attribute set to includeinferiors the default is clipbychildren however beware if any of the children are of a different depth to the parent the semantics of this are undefined by the protocol   gerard odriscoll gerardodriscolldpscouk  du pont pixel systems ltd

  deleted  in plain motify using a dialog inline like this simply isnt done you need to set callbacks from the buttonswidgets in your dialog and let the callback routines do the work in the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic   xview from sun actually supports this very neatly with a notify box which can return a status inline it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event driven style of an application  summary redesign required                       delta hedging a long option position also                    generates a short gamma exposure and any return           generated from delta hedging options can be thought              of as compensation for assuming gamma risk          radioactive investment management whew  
   if youre willing to do a little work you can make drawnbuttons do what you want moreorless one of my colleagues here at ge crd has done just that in our internal lymb system  we have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap clicking the button advances the knobs state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence  using drawnbuttons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget but thats normally not a big shortcoming you can make things look circular enough   skip montanarocrdgecom why cant x be this easy  me after learning about dlopen

    is there aything available for x similar to quickeys for the macintosh  something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes menu selections and mouse actions  directing them towards another application  if so could someone send me information on its availability  and if not how hard do we think it might be to send input to other x applications and hopefully deal with their responses appropriately  if an application is going to take a few seconds to process i probably have to wait  for it to complete before sending another command  thanks  david    
  0nd posting of the question that just doesnt seem to get answered  suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics  a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea  or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular expose events eg window managerdriven exposures take care of rendering the new image  using an expose event handler is a proper way to do this because at the time the handler is called the xlib window is guaranteed to be mapped  the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped  what we need to do is somehow tickle the window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item  what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior

   0nd posting of the question that just doesnt seem to get answered  how can we resist a questions that says something like this   the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window  is already visible and mapped  what we need to do is somehow tickle the  window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable  it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item    what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior  if your expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed rectangle information then you can use xcleararea to generate an expose event assuming that your background pixel is not none for the enclosing rectangle of your new item  this is still not great since any other items contained within that rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn  if your expose event handler simply redraws everything youll be doing much more work than just drawing the new item on top of the existing scene                    mike yang        silicon graphics inc                mikeysgicom           0000000000

  excerpts from netnewscompwindowsx 00apr00 monthly question about xcop buzz moschettibearcom 0000    a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the  window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea   or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the  new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler  that handles regular expose events eg window managerdriven  exposures take care of rendering the new image   hmmm clearly  depends on your programming model  it is not at all forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event  certainly any internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens to be generated  this doesnt preclude drawing immediately after updating the datastructures though   rob

  i have a peculiar color problem with macx apples macintosh x server id like to know if others have seen the same problem its happened with the current version 00 and with version 000 when some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly forcing the server to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors it doesnt happen for xterm windows but has happened for graphic windows and with some motif clients  i expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and when the new application starts up it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap it therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors  this makes it look ugly until its window gets priority  then macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted but now other applications are having to make do with its colormap  this is a problem with all color x servers or at least all color xservers i have seen when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap my solution is usually to 0 avoid colormapgreedy apps and 0 display applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather than in color if this is an option for the application    doug shaker voice0000000000 fax0000000000 emaildshakerqualixcom mailqualix group 0000 s norfolk st 000 san mateo ca 00000  qualix maintains a mailserver with information files and demo versions of products  if you would like more information on the mailserver send an email to qfactsqualixcom or  uunetqualixqfacts  the email should take the following form begin send help send index end name address phone   
   hi im trying to figure out how to make a window manager place the window where the create window command tells it regardless of what it may think is right my application has reason to know better  i dont want to set the overrideredirect because i do want all the embellishments that the window manager gives i just want the wm to accept my choice of location  ive tried twm tvtwm and mwm and they are all uncooperative  thanks  ethan    
    article crossposted from hpwindows    author was andy defaria    posted on mon 00 apr 0000 000000 gmt     for some reason the following code causes my x application to beep whenever i  intercept a keystroke and change its meaning  the intent of this code it to  allow date fields the following special keys    ttinsert todays date  bump day up by one  bump day down by one    i hardcoded some dates for this example  perhaps i shouldnt be using an  xmtext field for this           for some reason the following code beeps whenever any of the special keys   of tt are hit  why  the idea of this code is to interpret these   keys having the special meaning implied by the code  i would like to get   rid of the beeping but as far as i can tell im not doing the beep and    am at a lose as to understanding who and why the beeping is occuring        code deleted  from the xmtextfield man page during discussion of resources     xmnverifybell        specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed       during a verification callback  you are setting doit to false in the callback and textfield is beeping as it should  to turn off this behavior set this boolean resource to false  tom mcfarland tommccvhpcom  
    0nd posting of the question that just doesnt seem to get answered    suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains  xlib graphics  a button widget when pressed will cause a new item  to be drawn in the window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea   or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new  item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles  regular expose events eg window managerdriven exposures take care  of rendering the new image  using an expose event handler is a proper way  to do this because at the time the handler is called the xlib window is  guaranteed to be mapped    the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window  is already visible and mapped  what we need to do is somehow tickle the  window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable  it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item    what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior  if i understand your problem correctly you want to have a way to send exposures to your manager widget when your appspecific code draws xlib graphics on the window  it sounds like you might want to send an exposure using xsendevent and specifying a region if you know the region you need to send the exposure generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects you can use xcreateregion to create a region xunionrectwithregion to add the new object polygons to the region and then either use the region to clip your gc for the redraw or use xrectinregion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn keeping in mind that the stacking order of overlapping objects affects how they look  hope it helps    brian dealy                0000000000 it not knowing where its at   dealykonggsfcnasagov                thats importantits knowing uunetdftsrvkongdealy                where its not at  bdylan   brian dealy                0000000000 it not knowing where its at   dealykonggsfcnasagov                thats importantits knowing uunetdftsrvkongdealy                where its not at  bdylan

     as per your question why not have the button handler add the object and    then call the windowredraw or whatever directly  although depending  this design will work but i dont think it can take easily take advantage of expose event redraw optimization that is the whole window will be redrawn not just the area with the new item  ps  im replying here because myyour mailer didnt agree with the       return address whaleysigmakpccom

   the application creates window with a button quit and press me  the button press me pops up a dialog box the strange feature of  this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the  first time if i try to pop it up a 0nd time 0rd 0th  time   it is much slower  the shell is waiting for the windowmanager to respond to its positioning request  the windowmanager is not responding because it thinks the window is already in the right place  exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to me all information greatly received  bryan  
  does xdm work with decnet i have an ultrix machine running both tcpip and decnet i have a number of xterminals hanging off the ultrix host also running tcpip and decnet presently i am using xdm for the login procedure on the xterminals using tcpip since xdm is basically just an xwindows client shouldnt i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well  my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client it is making tcpip specific socket calls in this case the answer would be no you can not run xdm over decnet is this right or not any feedback is appreciated thanks

   i am currently attempting to get a copy of the hp widget set compiled under linux sls release with kernel 000 and am running into some problems  actually it seems that this is more of a gcc question because i got it to compile without trouble using cc on an rs0000 basically there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in lets say compositeph for instance the composite widgets insertchild procedure is set up with the type   typedef void xtwidgetproc widget  but in several places in the hp source code they reference the insertchild procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one as the prototype suggests  for example  superclasscompositeclassinsertchildw args pnumargs  now gcc chokes on this giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function  so does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in gcc or how i can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing usrincludex00compositeph or has anyone successfully built the hp widget set and have any suggestions many thanks in advance for any help    bill woodward         wpwoodaustinibmcom    try this first aix software support  billwaixwizaustinibmcom   graphics group        0000000000 i am the terror that flaps in the night

    yes its possible in fact theres some gl widget code in usrlppgl somewhere its named glibc my ibms down right now though so i cant find the exact location     warning this code feels quite bogus it does things like calling noport before winopen and then extracting an x window id from it anyway it worked just fine under aix 00 i spent last weekend trying to port it to 00 gl under 00 doesnt seem to like it and its turning into a hard job    check out your info pages it has some pretty good documentation on whan you can and cant do when mixing gl and x and how to go about doing so    rob

     i am developing an x xtxm application that will include a graphics window  of some sort with moving symbols among other things  a pure x application  could be implemented with motif widgets one of which would be an   xmdrawingarea for drawing with xlib  but i would like to take advantage of  the graphics library gl available on our ibm rs0000 sgis gl i believe    is it possible to mix x and gl in one application program  can i use gl subroutines in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window opened by me  with xopenwindow  there is a widget already defined for gl  it is the glxmdraw motif or glxdraw athena widget  it is similar to a xmdrawingarea except that it allows you to use gl calls to render into the window  look at glxlink glxunlink glxgetconfig and glxwinset in the man pages   i have never used gl before but the doc on gl winopen says that the first  time winopen is called it opens a connection to the server   also most of  the gl calls do not require a display or gc unlike most x calls  from this  initial information it appears that x and gl cannot be mixed easily   is this  true  the glxmdraw widget works pretty well  opengl will be an improvement   does pex graphigs have the same functionality of gl  i think gl is a little easier to use and a little more powerful but thats just an opinion  mileage may vary     larry d pyeatt                 the views expressed here are not internet  pyeatttexacocom    those of my employer or of anyone voice     000 0000000       that i know of with the possible                                 exception of myself  
  writes  0nd posting of the question that just doesnt seem to get answered    suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that  contains  xlib graphics  a button widget when pressed will cause a new item  to be drawn in the window  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea   or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the  new  item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that  handles  regular expose events eg window managerdriven exposures take care  of rendering the new image  using an expose event handler is a proper  way  to do this because at the time the handler is called the xlib window is  guaranteed to be mapped    the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window  is already visible and mapped  what we need to do is somehow tickle the  window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable  it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item    what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior  to incrementally update the contents of windows i use the following trick  0 set the window background to none 0 call xclearareadisplay window 0 0 0 0 true 0 restore the window background to its correct value  the call to xcleararea does not repaint the window background but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window  in order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased i encapsulate the 0 operations with 0 self addressed client messages which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server  xgrabserverdisplay client message startincremental  background none xcleararea restore background  client message endincremental xungrabserverdisplay  the grabserver prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the critical section   vincent prunet sema group sophia antipolis inria       bp 00    00000 sophia antipolis cedex  france prunetsophiainriafr 00 00 00 00 00 fax00 00 00 00 00

  according to the osfmotif style guide one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him so a hourglass cursor should be shown when the application is busy or a caution cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level so defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it is a rather complicated matter when cursors have been defined for some windows eg a crosswire cursor for a drawingarea things get even more complicated my intuition says that things should be easier but is this so if anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem please let me know the topics on busy cursors in the several faqs are not helpful since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to none  hans geurtsen                       phone 00 0 0000  00000 nucletron research bv             email hgnnuclintnl                                   surface waardgelder 0                                            nl0000 th  veenendaal   
  i am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a remote display  a local display being connected to the same system that the client is executing on  i have access to the display string but can i tell from the string  if the client is executing on host foo then 0 unix0 foo0 and localhost0 are all local  under ultrix i believe that local0 is also a valid display name a shared memory connection maybe  are there other strings that i should check for  is there a better way to detect this  thank you for any help you can give me    jim atkinsonwavefront technologies inc jrawticomwhat me  a company spokesperson  get real  life is not a spectator sport   
  some time back i asked for software recommendations to  allow me to run x from my pc at home to my sparc at the office  many thanks for all replies the majority of people  recommended pcxremote from ncd i received it yesterday  and installed it on my sparc and pc with only one hitch  the unix install consists of copying 0 files into some local bin directory  on the pc side i ordered the windows version  which  came with a slick windows installation   the only problem i had was that  my xinitrc  in my home directory had the line displayhostname00 export display  st the clients i kicked off connected to my xserver on the sparc console by removing this line from the xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at  hostname00  some comments on performance i was connected to a sparc 0 thru a netblazer terminal server over a 0000 baud line my pc is a 000dx0 ati ultra 00 mb  bitmap stuff sucked basic editing and compilation stuff definitely usable xmail was very usable  at times the first time u typed in an xclient window there was a very noticable delay i put this down to brain damaged windows should not be called a scheduler besides that this will become my remote work environment for a while  has anybody tried the non windows version of the product the sales person said they performed about the same given the over head of windows i question this  many thanks for help to all who responded  gerard

  some one asked me recently why they when they used xquerybestcursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could but the server did not create cursors of that size investigation showed that some x servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size the interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware  a sun0 with a cg0 will claim cursors up to root window size are ok while a sun0 with a cg0 will stop at 00x00 so far ive also seen this behavior on ncd and phasex x terminals and have been told it also occurs on hps  actually the ncd is even more liberal  sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as ok is xquerybestcursor semibroken or is this behavior correct id really like to see a 0000x0000 cursor    richard neitzel thorthoratducaredu          torren med sitt skjegg national center for atmospheric research        lokkar borni under solevegg box 0000 boulder co 000000000                gjoi med sitt shinn 0000000000                                    jagar borni inn  
   does xdm work with decnet i have an ultrix machine running both tcpip and decnet i have a number of xterminals hanging off the ultrix host also running tcpip and decnet presently i am using xdm for the login procedure on the xterminals using tcpip since xdm is basically just an xwindows client shouldnt i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well   xdm is not just an x window client  xdm has its own protocol xdmcp that operates of ucp on port 000  it does provide a login window which is an x window client  as to using decnet protocol  looking through the source for xdm from x00r0 that i have here it seems that the bare bones code is there but not completely there   my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client it is making tcpip specific socket calls in this case the answer would be no you can not run xdm over decnet is this right or not any feedback is appreciated thanks   from my look at the source it seems you cannot run it over decnet as shipped with x00r0  patrick l mahan   tgv window washer  mahantgvcom   waking a person unnecessarily should not be considered   lazarus long a capital crime  for a first offense that is            from the notebooks of   lazarus long  
  dear xperts  im developing an application that uses a motif slider to select an image file out of a directory now i would like to display the name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale button ie with the mb0 pressed as xmnshowvalue only displays the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding image file name i thought of using an xtaddeventhandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file name  xtaddeventhandlerscaleimagebutton0motionmask  false slidermoved null   and in the eventhandler do a    while xchecktypedwindowevent display eventwindow motionnotify return       xmscalegetvaluescaleimagevalue   map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open   however when i move the pointer in the scale widget i get callbacks with of co    urse a null effect as my mb0 is not pressed to move the scale button so what is goin    g wrong or is the a wrong approach to this problem any hints are highly appreciated  phil

  i am trying to build and use imake x00r0 on an ibm rs0000 running aix v00 i am having the following 0 problems  0 many of my imakefiles have contructs like                 this is a makefile         at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c         preprocessor and into the makefile  most of the c preprocessors that         i have used will not treat such a  as appearing at the start of the         line  thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the         start of a directive           however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol         as the start of a directive  the cpp fails when it determines         that this is not a known directive  i have temporarily hacked my         imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better         fix  0 several imakefiles use  as a parameter to a macro when a particular         use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter  the aix cpp         gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok  if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions i would appreciate information about on your solutions  perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that i have not reviewed  also do you know of other cpps that behave similarly  since i do not have easy access to news a response to whitebillypogisprccom would be appreciated

  i posted this a while ago and didnt recieve one reply and now we have another bug report on the same subject can anybody help me out  how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case  what i want is ctrlo and ctrlo to both be accelerators on one menu entry  in ora vol 0 in the section on accelerators it says for information on how to specify translation tables see vol 0 this is so you know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource  if you go to vol 0 it says likewise if a modifier is specified there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well for example the translation  shiftkeyqquit  will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as the shift key and the q key  this implies to me that setting xmnaccelerator to ctrlkeyo should do what i want but it doesnt it doesnt work if the user presses the control key the shift key and the o key  is it possible to supply  0 accelerator for a menu entry keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you cant use xtinstallaccelerators  i am using motif 000 on a decstation 0000 but i have also tried it on an hp using motif 000 and 00      steve dennis              internet sdennisannarborappliconslbcom software engineer         applicon inc            ann arbor michigan hail to the victors  
   im an new to this  having found some files public to look into i ftped them to a system i have access to  i then used kermit to transmit them via modem to my host computer a pcbased file system  i access internet through modem access to a university mainframe  from the pc file server i pull the files to a disk and then pull them from disk to a sgi indigo the sgi is not networked yet  when i try to uncompress and untar the files they either come out as garbage or i get an error in the tar process about directories being invalid what im wondering about is the transfer of unix files compressed binaryascii about multiple platforms  my guess is that it is the copy to a dos disk that is screwing things up  any help is appreciated bob

  i have two questions well probably more about how expose  configure events are handled  i have an appl which uses 0 window to draw in  since i give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized i made a translation table for the expose  configure events the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event calls my rescale method  the rescale method invokes a fake expose event actually just calls the redraw w an appropriate expose struct to draw the data  quest 0 when the appl is compiledlinked w r0 running in either r0 or r0 env i get multiple 0 redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed  i assume im getting cascading events  is that right any suggestions as to how to handletrap events in a better way  quest 0 when the appl is compiledlinked w r0 i get no expose events whatsoever  do events andor translation tables act differently in r0  thanks in advance  steve     steve kelleyumcp csumiacscaptain i protest internetskelleyumiacsumdedui am not a merry man  worf

  hi  ive looked in the faq and the oreilly books and was unable to find an easy means of finding out the state of state keys such as capslock and numlock  i can certainly track the events inside of my window and set a boolean there but what if capslock is pressed in another window  i looked at xgrabkey and decided it was definitely not what i wanted to do  i could find no convenience function to tell me that information  my question is this  is there a means of determining what the state of capslock andor numlock is  an even more pointed question is there an easy means of making an x keyboard act like a pc keyboard  ie capslock is active and the user presses shifta id like to get a lowercase a instead of a  any input is greatly appreciated please respond via email  i will repost a summary of my findings  thanks ralph  
   store and reply of mouse and keyboard events   to produce regression tests or automatic demos we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events produced by a user it should be possible to filter the mouse and keyboard events from the servers queue an to store them in a file this sequence of events stored in a file should be given  to the servers queue as if a user is working   0 exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all    mouse and keyboard events where  0 where one can catch these events to store them     in our case the servers queue is on a x terminal hp    where can we catch all events coming from a given    server    if this is not possible can we catch all events given    to a certain client and how      0 where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user     is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages    all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it    thanks in advance  ron

   do anyone know about any shading program based on xlib in the public domain i need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program  appreciate the help   i dont know if this might help but ive just started playing with a program called povray persistance of vision raytracer that also displays its output via x windows  it does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my psuedocolor 0plane display  i got the source from from a site in canda the person i retrieved them from was david buck dbuckccscarletonca  patrick l mahan   tgv window washer  mahantgvcom   waking a person unnecessarily should not be considered   lazarus long a capital crime  for a first offense that is            from the notebooks of   lazarus long  
   hi im trying to figure out how to make a window manager place the window where the create window command tells it regardless of what it may think is right my application has reason to know better  i dont want to set the overrideredirect because i do want all the embellishments that the window manager gives i just want the wm to accept my choice of location   what it may think is right may be exactly what the user wants assuming that your application has reason to know better is imho antisocial  if i start your application with a geometry option are you going to ignore that as well  theres really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything if its managing your window  you can ask you can hint but theres no guarantee that youre going to get what you want   tom lastrange        tomlboulderparcplacecom  
     try this after xcreatewindow      include x00xutilh    display display  window window        xsizehints xsizehints  xallocsizehints     xsizehintsflags  usposition  ussize or  pposition  psize     xsizehintsx  00    xsizehintsy  00    xsizehintswidth  000    xsizehintsheight  000    xsetwmnormalhints display window xsizehints    xfree xsizehints      these hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window  are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these  values if you use xsizehintsflags  pposition  psize this tells the window  manager that the values are prefered values of the program not the user  i dont know a window manager that doesnt place the window like you prefer if  you specify the position and size like above   you are right but please dont do this  it makes my brain hurt usposition and ussize should only be set if the user specified the position and size  you say tom dont blow a gasket whats the harm  some window managers do very different things besides positioning the window when they see usposition rather than pposition   tom lastrange        tomlboulderparcplacecom

  again poseted for a friend  okay i got such great response from my last question thanks everyone  lets try again  how can i tell if a colorcell is readonly  i want to use any readonly cells that are already in my colormap once i start running out of allocatable cells using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color  once i determine if a cell is readonly i assume i can then just request an xalloccolor with the exact same color specifications and it will  then be flagged as used by my application so that it doesnt later get freed by someone else and allocated again as readwrite to another application  so far the only way ive figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors once my colormap is all full up  it should error out if the cell is nonshareable but life would be much easier if i could just detect the readonlyshareable stuff directly  any ideas  noel ngorelicspeclabcrusgsgov

   animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident ximages into   server resident pixmaps using xputimage  once this is done the original ximages  can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using xcopyarea from the pixmaps to the windows drawable    hope this is helpfull    john    i just implemented this and it seems i can just about achieve the display rates 00 000x000x0 frames  sec on ipx that i get with sunview though its a bit choppy at times also loading the data making an ximage then xputing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome so the animation is slower to load than with sunview is there a better way to load in the data  rgoochrpcsiroau richard gooch writes   if you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the x server   you should use the shared memory extension to the sample x server mitshm   xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension this is certainly   available with the sample mit x server running under sunos   a word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared   memory and another word of warning openwindows is slower than the mit   server   i have written an imaging tool using xview for the gui by the way which   yields over 00 frames per second for 0000000 bit images running on a sparc   ipc half the cpu grunt of an ipx this has proved quite sufficient for   animations  regards  richard gooch  shared memory putimage also mentioned by nkissebedelphibeckmanuiucedu nick kisseberth looks interesting but i need someone to point me to some documentation is this method likely to give better results than server resident pixmaps id also be interested in looking at the xview code mentioned above  thanks for the help so far if i get something decent put together ill definitely post it to the net    derek c richardson     tel 0000 000000 x 00000       institute of astronomy  fax 0000 000000               cambridge uk                                          cb0 0ha                 email dcrmailastcamacuk

     two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation  of raster files with sunview becoming rapidly obselete ive  finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview  i put together a quick test and ive found that xputimage  is considerably slower factor of 0 on average than the  sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory  pixrects to a canvas this was on a sparc ipx it seems that  0 the x protocol communication is slowing things down or  0 xputimage is inefficientor both my question is what  the protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server memory this is the hog the conversions in the xputimage are fast   is the fastest way in x00r0 to dump 0 plane image data to  a window can i take advantage of the fact that the client is  running on the same machine as the server or am i stuck with  yes by utilizing the mitshm extension that provides an xputimage derivate that uses shared memory fine fast   xputimage in which case i might as well give up now    no you can still xputimage all of the frames onto pixmaps thus moving them to server memory and then replay them fastest using xcopyarea but be aware this is a major server memory bummer    oo  o                   brain inside                         o   o                                                 o   o  andre beck abpsoft mehl andrebeckirsinftudresdende  o  oo

     a colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation when he first logs on via xdm he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running  in this configuration x windows applications particularly xdvi work fine  however if he opens up a second xterm application suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window giving the error unable to load iso 00000 font     the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the xsession file with prettier colours and other slight changes  further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour and more significant all x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window  if i start the xterm with a different font using the fn option no problems  it would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts  note xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available so there doesnt appear to be a problem in the font directorieshashtables     other than rewriting the xterm appdefaults file to use a different font and hope for the best does anyone have any ideas  more info  this is the most recent mips workstation r0000 i believe        with the most current operating system and running x00r0        it is not mwms fault as the same problems occur under twm etc

   hello  i am testing a port of x00r0 to coherent a unix clone os for intel architecture machines  i am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt a simple terminal emulator program  the problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display one at a time  the characters appear to be too closely spaced with the result being that the 0nd character echoed destroys the  rightmost edge of the first character then the 0rd character destroys the  rightmost edge of the second character and so on  it looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character  there is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text only when the output is a series of individual characters  if anyone has any ideas what the problem might be or where i should look to find it it would be much appreciated  regards and thanks jon dhuse     jon dhuse                   internet jdhusesedonaintelcom  intel  corp  ch000        phone 0000000000  0000 w chandler blvd  any opinions expressed are my own  chandler az  00000     not my employers

  i consider twmstyle squeezed titles indispensable in a window manager i like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time with no overlap and since two windows arent enough i have other xterm windows underneath them with exactly the same positioning  in case youre not familiar with squeezed titles heres a crude picture    figure 0                                             title a                     title b            title c                    this is the               window b hides window c but            body of the             you can still see cs title              window window a       which is squeezed right                    figure 0   squeezed titles allow me to have about 0 such windows in each stack with easy access and 0 per stack is usually more than i really need since i also insist on having a virtual wm  the only problem is that the title location is static that is  it is configured in twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager doing so is cumbersome and timeconsuming  therefore i have implemented fsqueeze left center right  functions in my own copy of vtwm the idea being that with one click of a button you can change this            title a              this is the                    body of the                   window window a         to this                                          title a              this is the                    body of the                   window window a            okay so far so good now how the heck do i get them to put this into the next official twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm and the next ctwm and the next xyztwm that i never heard of  one way would be to post in compwindowsx a description of this enhancement together with an explanation of why i think it is a very good thing and hope that someone reads it   in case it isnt already clear why i think its a very good thing look back up at figure 0 and picture window a moved over on top of windows b and c now window as title hides window bs title but when you hit fsqueezecenter the result is                          title b     title a     title c                      this is the body of the window               window a which is on top                      the rest of this posting explains how to implement it based on my x00r0 copy of vtvwmshar its just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long  the key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the executefunction routine in menusc  ifdef shape case fsqueezeleft static squeezeinfo leftsqueeze   jleft 0 0  if deferexecution context func scrselectcursor   return true  tmpwinsqueezeinfo  leftsqueeze setframeshape tmpwin  break   and similarly for squeezeright  jright  and squeezecenter  jcenter   endif   of course you also have to define fsqueezeleft in parseh   and add      fsqueezeleft fkeyword fsqueezeleft        and so forth  to parsec  in order to use these functions add something like the following to your twmrc file  button0  m  s  wvdritdoor  fsqueezecenter     about a year ago i posted this but our news was broken and i think it didnt get out  since then blast has appeared in compsourcesx volume 00 issue 00 you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by chiseling away at an mwmstyle wide title better to have a twmstyle window manager i think   ralph betza fm uunetssinygnohmon         gnohmonssinycom  the question of whether a computer can swim is more interesting  than the question of whether a submarine can think  lenny dykstra

   in sdennis000000000aacadslbcom sdennisosforg writes    i posted this a while ago and didnt receive one reply and now we  have another bug report on the same subject can anybody help me out    the problem is that motif uses xgrabkey to implement menu accelerators  and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply  unfortunately  the specification for xgrabkey doesnt allow anymodifier to be combined  with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case  ctrl anykeyq    in ora vol 0 in the section on accelerators it says for information  on how to specify translation tables see vol 0 this is so you  know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource  if you go to  vol 0 it says likewise if a modifier is specified there is  nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well for  example the translation  shiftkeyqquit  will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as  the shift key and the q key    this is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using  event handlers instead of grabs its not true for menu accelerators  if  youre a motif implementor id suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics  changed to support the feature i described above  otherwise change the  documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the users  expectations because menu accelerators are not the same thing as  translations    is it possible to supply  0 accelerator for a menu entry    if you mean menu accelerator no its not possible  thats according to  the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page    keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you  cant use xtinstallaccelerators    i cant think of a reason why not    how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of  case  what i want is ctrlo and ctrlo to both be accelerators on one  menu entry  i find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing  if i were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators i would have one resource called accelerators that took a translation table period i would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed  as soon as the enduser specified one it would be active and automatically installed  to get multiple accelerators on a single menu item id do something like  menuitemaccelerators override n ctrlkeymfire n shiftkeylfire n  the accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a ctrl m show up in your menuitem object  why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different special cases depending on what type of widget youre dealing with  there has to be some reason  sorry for the political tone of this message   tom lastrange        tomlboulderparcplacecom  
   one advanage of mitshm is that if your images are large you dont end up  growing the size of the server process to hold them    correct most x servers use a version of  malloc0  which will not return   memory to the os ie the x server might  free0  a pixmap but the heap does   not shrink   one disadvantage of the mitshm is that in its sample implementation  there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments  if the client dies a sudden violent death eg kill  you have to   be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments    well part of the routines i mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around   that problem first i create the shared memory segment attach the client   attach the x server and then remove  the segment if you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone   now if the client dies thats one attachment gone the os cleans up for you   and since the x server notices the client has dies frees up its resources   including detaching from the segment there goes the last attachment no more   shared memory segment   terrible but it works  regards  richard gooch

  i am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics and imagery  the user of the widget will be able to specify when creating it whether it is to operate in x or gl mode  i have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button presses  they work fine when the widget is in x mode  in gl  mode they only work when the widget my glx widget is a child of a manager  put another way the translations do not work  when the widget is configured in gl mode and is a child of a  shell  does anyone know why this is happening  thanks in advance bruce gendler bgendlercsccom

    lets say i have two rectangles on the canvassee above   one intersecting the other  now i would like to delete one of the rectangles  the way i do it is to create another gc wherein i use the  gxxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly  created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes  a problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel   locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white which is   something that should be avoided  you could set up a bitmap with a mask in it  clear the bitmap draw the rectangle to be deleted with gxor  draw the one that is to stay with gxclear  then gxxor the entire pixmap with the screen    note that this is a pretty effective way of animation if you ever need to do that replace the gxclear with a gxxor   joe hildebrand hildjjfuentezcom software engineer fuentez systems concepts 0000000000  standard disclaimers apply

      i need probably to write one or more new motif widgets on the hpux    platform do i need the motif private header files and source    or can i make do with the public headers that are provided    motif includes xt in this context  yes  youll find it almost impossible without the source at this point  it does depend on how ambitious you are and how concerned you are about compliance with the general interface and items like traversal     one widget is a multicolumn list which lots of people have    already written i am sure and would therefore be probably be    a subclass of list rather than something simple like an xt class    is this more difficult in principle not lines of code  im not sure what youre asking  you could create something which is very much like a true multicolumn list by placing several lists within a geometry manager  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window  this wouldnt be good for very large lists  but you might consider this as an alternative     alternatively if anyone has a multicolumn list widget they    could sell me this might save me from having to write one    does it by any chance exist in motif 00 already i do not    yet have the spec  motif 00 does not have a multicolumn list in it  have you looked at commercial sets  there are also some pd  widget sets  one of these might have a multicolumn list you could port    douglas s rand drandosforgosfmotif dev snail         00 cambridge center  cambridge  ma  00000 disclaimer    i dont know if osf agrees with me lets vote on it amateur radio kc0kj  
   my question is this  is there a means of determining what the state  of capslock andor numlock is  alright  ignore this  i have delved a bit deeper xkeyevent and found what i was looking for  evstate   has a bunch of masks to check against lockmask is the one for capslock  unfortunately it appears that the numlock mask varies from server to server  how does one tell what mask is numlock and which are for meta mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask eg sgis vendor server has mod0mask being numlock whereas solaris 000 openwindows 00 has mod0mask for numlock  is there an unambiguous means of determining numlocks mask at runtime for any given server  sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance  thanks ralph

  cutsie little macintrashlike icons that are an instant recipe for mousitis imho system 0 is undoubtedly the worst gui i have used out of that riscos mswombles and x00 simply because it does not provide enough keyboard shortcuts windows i must confess i quite like cover your ears   because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the mouse stuff delete the user rather than making things easier  and there should always be the option to do it your way if you want to which is why i like the unixx combination so much  its so customizable   hear hear i agree completely one thing i cant stand about the mac interface is its shear determination to force you to use the mousewhat if your mouse breaksyour whole system is down  i like the mouseit is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around etc  but for most work the keyboard and hot keys are 0000 times faster than using the mouse sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it before your are experienced a month two speaking of pcs at the moment i dont think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menumouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in less time if you are experienced all of the above equally applies to windowing systems on unix especially since unix is at least 000 more powerful than dos       seth buffington uss gab 000 i   0000000000             sethcsuntedusethgabunteduunix operator

   i am trying to build and use imake x00r0 on an ibm rs0000 running aix v00 i am having the following 0 problems  0 many of my imakefiles have contructs like this is a makefile at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c preprocessor and into the makefile  most of the c preprocessors that i have used will not treat such a  as appearing at the start of the line  thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive   however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive  the cpp fails when it determines that this is not a known directive  i have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix  0 several imakefiles use  as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter  the aix cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok  if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions i would appreciate information about on your solutions  perhaps this is solved in a later version of imake that i have not reviewed  also do you know of other cpps that behave similarly  since i do not have easy access to news a response to whitebillypogisprccom would be appreciated

       sorry but olwm and tvtwm dont do it they place the title at that position    and the window at a position below it     this becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current    configuration and restore is later     currently my solution is     xcreatewindow    xsetwmproperties    xmapwindow    xflush    xmovewindow      it works with olwm but is less than elegant all this leaves me wondering    if im overlooking something obvious     richard   i know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the user window maybe other window managers have similar options another way to figure out the difference between the user window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window unfortunately you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way  greeting           tobias badingcstuberlinde

  ralph seguin rpsarbortextcom wrote   my question is this  is there a means of determining what the state   of capslock andor numlock is   alright  ignore this  i have delved a bit deeper xkeyevent and  found what i was looking for   evstate   has a bunch of masks to check against lockmask is the one  for capslock  unfortunately it appears that the numlock mask varies  from server to server  how does one tell what mask is numlock and  which are for meta mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask mod0mask  eg sgis vendor server has mod0mask being numlock whereas solaris  000 openwindows 00 has mod0mask for numlock  is there an  unambiguous means of determining numlocks mask at runtime for any  given server  sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance  youll have to check the keysyms on each of the keys for each modifier the one with numlock in its mapping is the modifier you want a bit ugly perhaps but i think its currently the only way to do this and it does have some precedent as keysyms are  used to differentiate capslock from shiftlock for the lock modifier  i dont know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous assignments either ie what if numlock is mapped for more then one modifier i suppose first found is as good as any  x doesnt handle locking modifiers that well   hope that helps  dave lapp  standard disclaimer etc

   i know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the user window maybe other window managers have similar options another way to figure out the difference between the user window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window unfortunately you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way  another way would be to use getgeometry to find out where you are relative to the frame and translatecoordinates to find out where your windows upperleft corner really is  ethan

       i am working on an xwindow based application that needs to  override some of the window manager focus processing  i am  using x00r0 and motif 00 currently although i will also be  working with open look in the future       what i need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the  user from switching from one window of the application to  another window  lets say for example that window a is on top  of window b in the window hierarchy  normally if the user clicks  the mouse in window b it will be brought to the top of the  window hierarchy and placed on top of window a  under certain  circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in window b i need to  beep and prevent window b from being raised on top of window  a        from the research and testing ive done so far it appears that  this window ordering is handled by the window manager in this  case motif  i havent found any way to override this default  processing through standard x window functions  i can tell  when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping  notify events but i cant find any way to tell motif not to make the  switch        the temporary solution ive currently come up with is very  kludgy but it partially works  when i detect such a window switch  in those cases when the switch is not allowed i manually force  the formerly top window back on top with an xraisewindow call  and beep with the xbell function  this provides the necessary  functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places  twice        does anyone know how i can tell motif or preferably any  window manager when i dont want the window order switch to  actually take place  respond either by email or posting to this  newsgroup  cheers     randall    randall severy                          uunet uunetgesevery           ge information services              internet geseveryuunetuunet    000 n washington st   mc00a           genie rsevery                   rockville md  00000    usa             phone 00000000000

    cutsie little macintrashlike icons that are an instant recipe for  mousitis imho system 0 is undoubtedly the worst gui i have used out of  that riscos mswombles and x00 simply because it does not provide enough  keyboard shortcuts windows i must confess i quite like cover your ears    because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the  mouse  stuff delete  the user rather than making things easier  and there should always be  the option to do it your way if you want to which is why i like the  unixx combination so much  its so customizable     hear hear i agree completely one thing i cant stand about  the mac interface is its shear determination to force you to use  the mousewhat if your mouse breaksyour whole system is  down  i like the mouseit is handy on some occassions such  as cut and past and moving icons around etc  but for most  work the keyboard and hot keys are 0000 times faster than  using the mouse sure it is a plus to be able to do something  simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it  before your are experienced a month two speaking of pcs at  the moment  i dont think it is too much to ask that window  programmers provide not only a menumouse interface but also  look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and  command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in  less time if you are experienced  all of the above equally applies to windowing systems on  unix especially since unix is at least 000 more powerful than  dos   and at least 000 more user unfriendly as well

   tcpview is the result of several problems we had at uw  we have several network general sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets these are good tools but they are 0 heavy  0 hard to find when you need one 0 limited in their software expandibility 0 difficult to use to upload data for analysis 0 cannot be remotely operated and 0 cannot resolve names with dns requiring much manual  manipulation of the name table  we also sometimes use tcpdump but we found  it 0 too difficult for most people 0 did not have enough information for many protocols 0 could not be used interactively 0 could not handle tcp streams and 0 could not read sniffer files  however tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols and could be easily modified  tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features  tcpview has been tested on a decstation 0000 and sun 0 under ultrix 00 and sunos 00 respectively  it should work on the same systems as tcpdump it compiles with cc and gcc on the dec and sun  to build tcpview you will need motif 00 or better  the following files are available for anonymous ftp from  ftpcacwashingtonedu in pubnetworking  tcpview00tarztcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview00suntarzsun0 binaries tcpview00dectarzdec mips ultrix 00 binaries  what tcpview adds to tcpdump  easier interface  enhanced protocol decoding  hex display of frame  capture based on time number of frames or user interrupt  can show ethernet addresses with manufacturers name  ethernet address host table  can easily follow a stream highlighting outoforder frames  can send tcp data to an external file or filter for additional processing   changes to tcpdump 000  new features  now reads and writes network general sniffer files  when used with r the  file type will be automatically detected  can now read in and use an snmp mib file  the hex format has been changed  new time options have been added  options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in tcp packets  bugs were fixed in the relative tcp sequence numbers s flag  new flags rread sniffer file  not usually needed except for reading from stdin tttprints delta times ttttprints times relative to the first frame wwrite a sniffer save file use with w xprint frame minus linklevel header in hexdump format   sample output  000000000000 jeffcacwashingtonedu0000  nicfunetfiftp s 000 win 00000         0000  00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 0c 00 0c 0c 00 0f 00 00     ep         0000  00 d0 00 00 00 00 00 00 0b 00 0a 00 00 00 00 00     dj         0000  00 00 00 00 0e 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00           pn  xprint tcp data in hexdump format used with z zwrite tcp data to stdout use with t to eliminate timestamp zwrite frames and tcp data to stdout   martin m hunt martinhcacwashingtonedu networks  distributed computing university of washington          martin hunt                            martinhcacwashingtonedu    networks and distributed computing     university of washington    
   we developed a toolkit running on the x window system the toolkit copes with any languages based on x00r0s i00n facility as you know there are 0 kinds of i00n implementation from mits  x00r0 release  xsi and ximp our original implementation of the toolkit uses xsi  our toolkit manages each characters size based on our own font management system in order to do that the wchart typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets this means that if one wchart type compound string with  ascii and kanji mixed for example is given each element of the wchart array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environments locale in this case if the locale is japanese each wchart character will be classified either to iso00000 jisx0000 or so  we need a function to do this the function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is  we could not find any public x00r0 function to do that and inevitably used xsis internal functions to construct that function the following is the source code of that function decomposecharacterset   i00nh  this may look like c code but it is really  c   id i00nhv 00 00000000 000000 iima exp iima   ifndef i00nh define i00nh  include x00xlibh  extern int decomposecharactersetconst wchart wcstr in   int wclen in   char buf out   int buflen inout   int scannedlen out   char charset out  extern xmstring wchartoxmstringconst wchart wcstr extern xmstringcharset charsetofwcharconst wchart wc  endif  i00nh   i00ncc  id i00nccv 00 00000000 000000 iima exp    include stdlibh include x00xlibinth include xmxmh include i00nh  extern c  include x00wcharh define xwcdecomposeglyphcharset xxxxwcdecomposeglyphcharset define xmbfscs xxxxmbfscs define xmbctidtocsid xxxxmbctidtocsid include xlocaleinth undef xwcdecomposeglyphcharset undef xmbfscs undef xmbctidtocsid     extern int xwcdecomposeglyphcharsetxlocale const wchart int  char int int int     extern charset xmbfscsxlocale csid     extern csid xmbctidtocsidxlocale csid   int decomposecharactersetconst wchart wcstr in    int wclen in    char buf out    int buflen inout    int scannedlen out    char charset out       xlocale xlocale  xfallbackconvert     int ctid     int status     charset xcharset          status  xwcdecomposeglyphcharsetxlocale wcstr wclen buf        buflen scannedlen ctid     if status  success  xcharset  xmbfscsxlocale xmbctidtocsidxlocale ctid charset  xcharset  xcharsetcsname  null          else charset  null     return status    an included file above xlocaleinth is also xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled  a serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our hp machine with its os version of hpux000  when we tried to link an application based on our toolkit link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing     xmbctidtocsid code     xmbfscs code     xwcdecomposeglyphcharset code     xfallbackconvert code  we had used mit release version of x00r0 and its xsi implementation until hpup00 and ran applications successfully one of the reasons to use xsi was that because hp did not release hps x00r0 until the os 00 and we had no way to  know how hps r0 would be implemented we had hoped xsis popularity and used  its internal functions   the hps linker complains that there are no xsi internal functions implemented we observe from hps libx00a they used some ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used mits vanilla ximp version or their own version of ximp and therefore finding just counter part functions in mits ximp for xsi does not seem to lead us a solution  my question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like decomposecharacterset listed above is there any function to check character set of each element of wchart type strings depending on locales if it is a public function that is perfect but even if it is not we want to use any internal functions in hps x00r0 as we did for mits r0  in order to render a wchart type string there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string we have no way to find out that without any hps x00r0 source  files we want to know how we can use that for our goal  any help or comments would be highly appreciated  i also appreciate if anyone tell me about ximp treating around this area even if it is not hps implementation  thank you   takeshi inoue inouecrdyokogawacojp yokogawa electric corporation open systems laboratory0000000000

  excerpts from netnewscompwindowsx 00apr00 x toolkits paul prescodundergradm 0000   i get the impression andrew is from the fsf but i dont know what it  looks like either  the andrew user interface system is supported maintained enhanced and distributed by the andrew consortium carnegie mellon  the distribution terms are those of the x consortium not the gnu public license  thus anyone can commercially exploit the andrew code without restriction  to encourage membership however we defer universal release of the latest versions until consortium members have had an opportunity to explore the new capabilities  to se what auis looks like you can try a remote demo  you need an x server r0 is best on a machine linked to the internet  give the command   finger helpatkitccmuedu   for instructions  note  the demo version does not use the motiflookandfeel scrollbar but one is available  you can use it on the demo by changing an option in the preferences file and starting a new editor  the andrew toolkit component of auis is ideal if you want to build applications using compound documents  andrews major feature is its architecture for recursive embedding of objects equation in table in figure in text for example  this architecture extends to areas not usually found in toolkits including file stream formats cutpaste and printing  andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications  word processor spreadsheet drawing editor and font editor the latter two are in version 00 which will be generally released on the xr0 tape in december  fred hansen director andrew consortium

  does anybody have an x server for nt that theyre willing to share files or experiences  bill steer westinghouse  
  we have an old sun000 here which gets occasional use  when x00r0 is started on it any console messages during startup are undeletable  after x is fully started we run an xterm as the console  the problem is that any messages that arrive before this starts go to the plain console  refresh window fails to remove them  the messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of the screen obscuring anything else below them  at boot time the 000 lists two framebuffers    devcgfour0 and devbwtwo0 were running x in color and i suspect that maybe the offending messages are on the bw framebuffer and thereby not getting deleted  my question is has anyone else seen this and is there an easy way to get rid of these messages  please reply by email to hughminmoscouk  hugh mcintyre inmos ltd bristol uk  btw sunos 000 x00r0 mwm  ps i know i can redirect output of the relevant commands to devnull  im     looking for a more general solution  
      im writing an x server for some videogeneration equipment  the  hardware is truecolor in yuv space in x terms it has a 00bit  static color visual  i would really like to have the server just  present this static visual but im not sure if this will be   acceptable to most x clients  the three problems i see are      0 the colormap though huge is static    0 all pixels would be 0 bytes wide    0 because the hardware actually lives in yuv space the       translation rgbyuv will introduce some rounding error    being more of a server guy than a client guy i ask will these  limitations thwart many x clients  or will most of the x stuff  floating around blithely accept what theyre given  i could write  the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of eg 0 bits   but id rather avoid this if not necessary    even 00bit truecolor machines are in most cases running an emulated 0 bit pseudocolor visual only to get standard x clients motif apps and thelike to run i strongly suppose you to emulate at least   00 bit truecolor should be no problem only some translation rounding   should not make big misfits  0 bit pseudocolor more of a problem you have to emulate a colormap   pixel indices conversion stuff furthermore you should run your default   screen on this visual   oo  o                   brain inside                         o   o                                                 o   o  andre beck abpsoft mehl andrebeckirsinftudresdende  o  oo

   even 00bit truecolor machines are in most cases running an emulated 0 bit pseudocolor visual only to get standard x clients motif apps and thelike to run i strongly suppose you to emulate at least   00 bit truecolor should be no problem only some translation rounding   should not make big misfits  depends on the nature of the rounding  x allows the user to do bit arithmetic on pixel values ie  xor foreground and backgroun pixel values together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a function of gxxor fill change foreground to background and viceversa if your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then  clients that use them will break  ken  kenneth whaley 000 0000000 kubota pacific computer inc email whaleykpccom 0000 walsh avenue santa clara ca  00000

    no it isnt  it is the x window system or x00 or x or any of  a number of other designations accepted by the x consortium  in fact  doing man x on pretty much any x00 machine will tell you         the x consortium requests that the following names  be  used       when referring to this software                                      x                             x window system                               x version 00                       x window system version 00                                   x00    there is no such thing as x windows or x window despite the repeated  misuse of the forms by the trade rags  this probably tells you something  about how much to trust the trade rags  if they cant even get the name  of the window system right why should one trust anything else they have   to say  i used to think this way and not just about x for example incorrect english constructs such as its raining or its window id annoy me however there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world indeed the fact that x won out over news was really down to popular opinion i know we all think its technically superior as well  on a related topic who is to say that color is more or less correct than colour  being irish and hence using english english as opposed to american english i always use the latter except of course for api terms such as xalloccolor and colormap  in a world that uses the term windows to refer to microsoft windows perhaps the time has come to accept x windows as a valid term for x i think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than say the x window system and lets face it almost everyone uses it ultimately we all need product sales to more than just xliterate people in this respect product recognition is important and a short snappy descriptive title x is positively obscure will help when dealing with the average punter its sad  i thought i was a software engineer indeed it is unfortunate that x did not become popularly known as windows and let ms worry about whether it should be called microsoft windows or the microsoft window system or how about just plain microsoft  to summarise or should that be summarize the point of this message i think there are far more pressing issues facing the x community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system or should that be windowing system whatever gets recognised is fine by me i agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say however i would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the x window system   gerard odriscoll gerardodriscolldpscouk du pont pixel systems ltd

  the xview version 0 source distribution included in the contrib section  of x00r0 included the source to the textedit program  id like to take  the sources and modify them to add support for a tooltalklike message  server and maybe for tooltalk while im at it since the sunsupplied textedit binary doesnt seem to speak tooltalk  however the sources in the r0 contrib area seem to be for an older version of textedit than the version shipped with openwindows 0  for example the own 00 textedit includes drag and drop support and a  dropsite in the main control area while the source in contribxview knows nothing about drag and drop  the texteditc included in the xview sources says its version 0000 dated 00000 while doing a what textedit on the own 00 binary says          texteditc 000 000000 copyr 0000 sun micro         dragdropc 000 000000 copyr 0000 sun micro         tooltalkc 000 000000 copyr 0000 sun micro         dsrelnamec    00 000000 copyr 0000 sun micro  so does anyone know if the 00000 sources to textedit are available id really like to work from the latest source if possible  please reply by email and ill post a summary if theres enough  interest   matt landauwaiting for a flash of enlightenment  mattcenterlinecom  in all this blood and thunder  
   i have noticed in framemaker 00x on both the sgi and sun platforms that certain dialogs such as column layout for example respond to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is not in the dialog window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is pointer  how is this done  i would like to emulate this behavior in my application it seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus  alternatively im open to any suggestions as to what is the right way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear particularly when they are invoked from the keyboard and ones keyboard focus policy is pointer  allen barnett whose wife graciously allowed to use her account  
  im writing an application running under x using motif and i need to do some stuff when the application quits  now when i shut down my x windows session it doesnt seem to send a sigterm or whatever signal to my application im trapping various signals like that  therefore i thought i could use an x signal to check for my top level window being destroyed  however i seem to get destroynotify events whenever i move windows  is there any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed some field to check or some combination of events  replies by email please and i will summarise  thanks for any help                       ian                                   iancompsciliverpoolacuk

   a motif 000 application will periodically hang when run against the  openwindows 0 server xnews  i have seen the same problem using a sparcstation 00 solaris 00 ow 00 in my case it happens far more often than periodically  i dont know if theres a corresponding patch for solaris 00 but this sounds like the following bug which is supposedly fixed in 00000000 the solaris 0x olwm jumbo patch  0000000  window system can hang in an errant pointer grab  actually i suspect that the ow 00 problem may be different since the readme file says that this patch is just a sunos 0x version of the ow 00 olwm but maybe that line came from an earlier version of the patch and they forgot to take it out in the 00 version   barry margolin system manager thinking machines corp  barmarthinkcom          uunetharvardthinkbarmar

  i created a pixmap or drawable window then used xdrawline function  to draw a clipped line   000  i created the pixmap or drawable window only with size 000x000 but i draw line from p0x0000y0000 to p0x0000y0000 my question is dose the xdrawline function can finger out that correct p0x0 and y0 for me if you calculate x0 and y0   if youre asking does the x server perform clipping correctly when drawing lines the answer is yes  
  i would like to keep track of x development on  aux  ultrix  openwindows currently i cannot use the newsgroup compwindowsx  and would like to use the email based info  thanks   folkert boonstra    cap gemini innovationdutch research centre  burgelsenlaan 000phone00 00 0000 000  po box 0000fax00 00 0000 000  0000 ga rijswijk nlemailboonstracapintsuucp

  im working on an x00r0 application and have concerns regarding  standard colormaps  the x00r0 documentation says usually a window manager creates  these colormaps  i wonder what window manager the writer had  in mind  neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps  of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps   however xstdcmap doesnt seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap  when i use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black   so it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid  perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps things would  be wonderful  but not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps  finally the operation of the functions xmugetcolormapallocation  xmustandardcolormap and xmucreatecolormap seem inconsistent  with the section 000 of the x00r0 xlib documentation      according to the section 000 of the x00r0 xlib documentation p 000      for grayscale colormaps only the colormap redmax redmult and      basepixel members are defined  the other members are ignored       to compute a grayscale pixel value use the following expression              gray  redmult  basepixel 0xffffffff      xmugetcolormapallocation defined in mitlibxmucmapallocc is      used by xmulookupstandardcolormap defined in mitlibxmulookupcmapc     to select redmax greenmax and bluemax values for the      call to xmustandardcolormap  when the rgbgraymap property is      specified xmugetcolormapallocation sets redmax to 00 of the      total number of cells in the gray scale sets greenmax to 00      of the total number and sets bluemax ot 00 of the total number     referring to section 000 one would expect xmugetcolormapallocation      to set redmax to the total number of cells in the gray scale      when the rgbgraymap property is specified xmustandardcolormap      defined in mitlibxmustdcmapc sets redmult greenmult      and bluemult all equal to 0  referring to section 000      one would expect greenmult and bluemult to be ignored      when redmult greenmult and bluemult all equal 0      xmucreatecolormap defined in mitlibxmucrcmapc constructs      a gray map the sum of redmax greenmax and bluemax gives      the maximum gray value  referring to section 000 on would      expect redmax to give the maximum gray value

   im working on an x00r0 application and have concerns regarding   standard colormaps    the x00r0 documentation says usually a window manager creates   these colormaps  i wonder what window manager the writer had   in mind  neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps  standard colormaps were specd with the intention that window managers would make them available this doesnt mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority  the esge server we ship makes the xargbbestmap available at startup it doesnt wait for window managers to do it   of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps    however xstdcmap doesnt seem to try very hard to avoid   conflicts with the default colormap  when i use standard   colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black    so it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very   problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid  perhaps   if every application used standard colormaps things would   be wonderful  but not many applications seem to use   standard colormaps  does your hardware have only one clut since standard colormaps typically devour all 000 entries there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one clut  i dont believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap rather colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap an example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use xargbbestmap or whatever its called under x00r0  if you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap if you cant do that then youll get flashing on a one hw clut framebuffer  now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client this flashing could also be avoided perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps       paulpmartzdsdescom evans  sutherland

   i am almost done porting xfree00 00 to a new piece of display hardware but have run into a snag i think may be somewhat commonplace so im sending a netfeeler  i have a display that is a noninterlaced memory mapped 0bit 000x000 display  the servers view of the world obtained via xwd  xwud seems to be exactly what it should be  however the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long  after a bit of experimentation it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry but the scanline size in the buffer is 00 bytes which isnt exactly divisible by four  changing the following defines in mitserverincludeservermdh    define bitmapscanlinepad  00 define log0bitmappad0 define log0bytesperscanlinepad0    to    define bitmapscanlinepad  00 define log0bitmappad0 define log0bytesperscanlinepad0    was not exactly the right solution  how do i tell the server either a dont pad the scan lines at all cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display or to pad only to byte boundries  im using a customized version of xfree00v00 under mach 00  thanks brian  
  these are two common subjects so i hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions  0  if my application depends on modifiers what is the best lookup method my choices are to call xgetmodifiermapping for each key press with a  modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table  i would like to do it the second way but i cant seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers  i know that when an app calls xsetmodifiermapping a mappingnotify event is generated nonmaskable which i can pick up and modify my internal table  but i dont seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap  if i use xt all  oreilly has to say is is automatically handled by xt  if i use xlib ala xnextevent i get nothing  this all stems from problems with users of  the sun 00 keyboard and the numlock plus various altmetaetc modifier  requirements  0  i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window  i want it at the same y coord and their rightleft sides touching  what i need to ask for is the xy coord of the window  managers border for the main window  this should ring a bell with anyone who has called xtmovewidget immediately checking the xy after the move and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the xy and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border  any help would be most appreciated  darcy darcymccallummentorgcom  
  i have the following problem on x00r0 servers  when a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the save under attribute set the subwindows of my window are not restored  normally the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window no expose event is sent  when exposuremask is set for the child windows those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws  everything works fine with x00r0  is this something that is changed between x00r0 and x00r0 obvious is it something i do wrong is there something that the popup window should do which is also mine is this a bug in x00 release 0  greetings    hans bos                        domain  hansxelionnl xelion bv                          uucp    sun0nlxelionhans postbus 00                         phone   00 00 000000

  x window installation on a sun0000 with cg0 alone and with cg0 as screen00 and cg0 as screen00  questions 0  are there any hardware configuration changes on the cg0 andor cg0 devices that need to be made other than pulling out and inserting the cg0 frame buffer in the vme bus  0  the cg0 is called a graphics accelerator as apposed to a frame buffer what is the significance of this to the x server and how do we install the sunos driver  x to be compatable   i would appreciate any information on this  i am posting this on the behalf of dr john charlton who does not have net access please reply to him directly at charltonbmeuncedu or just send it at this address and i will forward it   thank you for your help  anay panvalkacsuncedu

  we have a sun 000 and we have just acquired a cg0 frame buffer card  the cg0 is supposed to support both a 00bit color visual and a monochrome visual the default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome and we are unable to change it to the 00bit visual we have tried using xgetvisualinfo to get a visual of depth 00 but had no success  xdpyinfo gives no information about a 00bit deep visual only monochrome   there are two possible solutions if someone has patches for x00r0 xsun server could they forward them to us  otherwise could someone instruct us how to access the 00bit color in openwindows   jon herlockeremail  herlocklclarkedu lewis  clark college portland or 00000

   weve just recently upgraded our x00 to r0 and are now running into problems with some of our applications that use motif 00  it appears that pointer to the widget being passed to the callback function ie the w of w client call  is nil  the client and call pointers are okay in some instances but bogus in other instances  we are running sunos 000 on a sun 0  after compiling x00r0 and all 00 patches with the motifbc flag set we recompiled motif and then we  recompiled the application  did we skip a step or leave something out  is there a flag that we should have used  should we have left motif alone  any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated  thanks kathy   kathy saint               shes a witch shes a witch im not dead yet       how can you tell shes a witch                           she looks like one saintmitchellhaccom         monthy python  the holy grail  
   in article 0qtk00rn0picassocsscsydtansucomau gpatapisboydtansucomau writes  what sort of traffic is generated with the xcalls  i am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running dvx is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response time  anyone have any ideas     i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network itself to give you a realworld example here at quarterdeck we have roughly 000 people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell file servers and each other its not too much of a load on our ethernet with maybe 0 concentrators so you have 0000 people on each segment if you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns  but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a 000 00 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have 00 people running programs off it youre going to see some slowdowns because youre now on effectively a 00 mhz 000 of course dvx will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have 00 working programs running youll know it   well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the  significant drop in price year after year  the link i want to use  though isdn 00k is costly and the bandwidth limited  thats why my interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic  goes through it   having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing you could probably run 0000 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth  hmmm  has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all  are you running any standard mswindows programs like word   what sort of  packets go blazing through what size link do you have 0mb or 00mb  what is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you have few high peaks and then many low points   it all really depends on what the programs are doing ie youre going to see a slowdown from xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also    what do you mean by network things  i vision using ms windows and other windows applications over the network were the processes are running on the server and all i am getting are the displays  i am wondering how  good is the x and subsequently dvx protocol in transferring these  images with xcalls and displaying them on a clients machine          quarterdeck office systems  internet support  tom bortels  pricingordering  infoqdeckcom    tech questions  supportqdeckcom   bbs 000 0000000  fax 000 0000000  compuserve go quarterdeck    qfax 000 0000000 from touchtone phone for technotes on demand        george patapis pan metron ariston     telecom cssc lane coveemailgpatapiscsscsydtansucomau     pobox a000 sydney south fax  00 000 0 000     nsw 0000 australiavoice00 000 0 000

  hi there  i posted this to compwindowsxintrinsics but got no response so im posting here  im wanting to connect a digitiser made for pcs into my workstation an hp 000 it is my understanding the x windows can understand a variety of input devices including digitiser tablets  however this digitiser makes use of the serial port so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver  the hp manual pages say that the hp x server will accept x input from devices listed in the usrlibx00xdevices file   display number i shouldnt think i would be able to simply insert devrs000c as an input device in this file and expect a digitiser to work  but maybe im wrong  am i  what i would like to know is does anybody out there have a digitiser connected to their workstation for use as a pointer for x rather than just as input to a specific x application  if so what were the steps required for installation did you need a special device driver  did the manufacturer supply it  are there generic public domain device drivers around  i understand that digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats  any help would be greatly appreciated  cheers  vaughan    vaughan clarkson                      email vaughanewddstogovau engineering phd student                                phone 0000000000  glider pilot                           fax 0000000000

   hi ppl  i am running xfree000 under linux sls00 and am trying to get the german keyboard working i have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just fine i have found out that there is a preconfigured german keymap for x called xmodmapgr in usrlibx00 so i ran xmodmap usrlibx00xmodmapgr my first impression was very good i was able to get z and y straight  theres still a little problem i cant solve however i cannot get at the backslash bar brackets and curly brackets the altgr key doesnt seem to work i tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does looking up its keycode 000 in the xmodmap i found the entry modeswitch which doesnt ring any bell the entries for the keys i cannot use seem to be correct example keycode xx  ssharp questn backslash the first 0 entries i can even get at the first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift but what is the 0rd my guess is that it should be the key with altgr but it isnt if anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them help would be appreciated  cu  alaric

  i have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes and collects data from that nodes periodically i need to display this data on my x application i tried to invoke this server using xtaddapptimeout which works ok but the problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data so i doesnt returns to eventloop during that time and my application remains busy and it doesnt respond to users input i button press events are queued and exected after server finished its task now i am going to try appaddinput call so that it reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe  i am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client which is my x application will read now i have some doubts which you may be able to clarify  0 when i fork a process it will create to copy of my process right     now what does this two copies mean two shells where should i fork    my application what are the responsibilities of this processes how    should i call this processes  0 can i fork more than one processes so that i can read from more    than one servers input  thanks  samir patel    spatelcstamuedu

  shermanleacscncsuedu chris sherman gripes  it really bums me out that xv went shareware  xvs been shareware for about a year  hadnt you noticed i dont have a problem with this  john bradley has put a hell of a lot of work into xv and if he feels that its time to get some monetary reward from it thats surely his right   can the author legally sell xv  xv uses tiff and jpeg code developed  by others  did the author get permission to sell these works  had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the ijg jpeg code which are right there in the xv distribution you would have observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware and commercial software  sam lefflers libtiff copyright also grants permission for unrestricted use including resale   my guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author  maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product  commercial  theres a big difference between a polite request for a voluntary donation and commercial itsillegaltocopythis andwellsicourlawyersonyou software  i do agree that johns readme file could be a little clearer about what he means by personal use  regards tom lane organizer independent jpeg group  
  i am in the process of modifying an x application that uses xlib  id like to include a timerdriven facility for network polling  you have to do the same sorts of things that xt does with its main loop that is you have to rig up a timer queue and you have to put a  select0 or poll0 call in your main loop  you can obtain the  file descriptor of the x display connection using      fd  connectionnumber display  the functionality of the main loop dispatcher in xt is quite useful the good news is you can get the source and plagiarize

  how can i capture buttonpressbuttonrelease events in multiple clients i want to know if the user is still at the display before locking the screen i can get  keypresskeyrelease and pointer motion events but if the user is pressing the mouse button in the same location the mouse doesnt move i cant capture the events    the oreilly xlib programming manual vol 0 says on page 000    only one client can select button events on any one window at one time      due to the grab that automatically takes place    any help would be appreciated  deryl steinert dusornlgov

  i am having the problem of ensuring pointtofocus when the mouse cursor enters a window in my application  im using interviews but that may not matter this seems to be a generic problem in x for example i use openwindows on a sparc0 with pointtofocus set and that generally works but not always depending on what was going on in some window when i move the cursor from one shell tool window to another  or so it seems  my question then is what can i do within x to guarantee pointto focus within my application  thanks for any response  dave

  repost  i have two questions well probably more about how expose  configure events are handled  i have an appl which uses 0 window to draw in  since i give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized i made a translation table for the expose  configure events the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event calls my rescale method  the rescale method invokes a fake expose event actually just calls the redraw w an appropriate expose struct to draw the data  quest 0 when the appl is compiledlinked w r0 running in either r0 or r0 env i get multiple 0 redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed  i assume im getting cascading events  is that right any suggestions as to how to handletrap events in a better way  quest 0 when the appl is compiledlinked w r0 i get no expose events whatsoever  do events andor translation tables act differently in r0  thanks in advance       steve kelleyumcp csumiacscaptain i protest skelleyumiacsumdedui am not a merry man  worf

  one way to mask the left button check the contents of the xevent that the xaddeventhandler send to your eventhandling function in your case it is the showmouseposition function   if the xevent arrive in this function as   xevent pevent  then the value of peventxbuttonbutton is the button that was pressed so  you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them in case it was not clear peventxeventbutton is an int   by the way you mentioned the button0motionmask and if anyone can help me with  these motionmasks i would be grateful i can not figure out how do distinguish between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring in  essence i would like an seperate eventhandler for motion with each button  unfortunately the xevent sent by a motionmask does not seem to contain the  value of the pressed button  any ideas eps

  hello  the title just about says it all  i need a list of the bugs for motif 00  thanks neal   
  i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif but im hoping is really just a mistake on my part  does anyone know anything about this problem   i am using an xmtextfield and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded   text string ascii or kanji either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring   the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed the text is getting   truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables   lang more specifically lcall  when they are set to japanese   the text gets truncated  when they are set to english everything   works fine  i am taking the default for xmncolumns   please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual    application just in my sample code to make things easier   i am running motif 00 x00r0 via hpux000  my test program is set up   to handle 00 bit kanji characters  i have remembered to do      xtsetlanguageproc prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources   are set to japanese fonts   dont know if this matters but my dialog box and textfield is initially   created with uil    the problem does not happen with xmtext  unfortunately substituting xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative way too much code to be modified while in beta  i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it  my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese but since i dont have the source to look at it is just a guess  please let me know if this sounds familiar or if you have a suggestion or if you want the sample program  thanks   susan     swalkerbbncom   0000000000   
     the shell is waiting for the windowmanager to respond to its  positioning request  the windowmanager is not responding because  it thinks the window is already in the right place    exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to  me all information greatly received  this problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows a misfeature of the x protocol and a bug in the xt intrinsics    the intrinsics bug is that it ignores the xy position given in reparentnotify events  olwm is structured in such a way that when a window is popped down the last event the client receives is a reparentnotify event  at this point the intrinsics notion of the shells location is out of date  if a setvalues is done using the same xy position the intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell so it issues a configurewindow request to move it there  however a misfeature of the x protocol is that a configurewindow request that has no effect will generate no configurenotify event  the intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive and times out after wmtimeout has expired  actually things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager but the net result is the same  the solution is for the intrinsics to note the xy positioning information in reparentnotify events  this has been implemented and is available in x00r0 public fix 00  this is xbug 0000 for those of you who are interested in gorier details  smarks    stuart w marksstuartmarksengsuncom window systems technology0000 garcia ave ms 00000 sunsoft incmountain view ca 00000  
  i dont seem to be able to get window positions reliably through the xview xvget function     x  int xvgetmyframe xvx    y  int xvgetmyframe xvy  for example if i set xvx  xvy to 0000 the frame comes up in the correct position with the top left corner the size handle at 0000 xvget returns 0000 as well but later on xvget returns 000 without any intervening xvsetmyframe xv my frame is fitted around a canvas and it turns out by measuring on the screen that 000 is the position of the first pixel in my canvas relative to the frames origin what gives any help most appreciated  derek  ps on a related subject is there any way of querying the window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around frames etc    derek c richardson     tel 0000 000000 x 00000       institute of astronomy  fax 0000 000000               cambridge uk                                          cb0 0ha                 email dcrmailastcamacuk

  i am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on another machine both are hp 0000 model 000s  the image is created using xcreateimage and xgetimage and displayed with xputimage  the image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because the server on the other machine is using a different colormap  i tried saving the colormap pixel and rgb values and on the redisplay performed a table lookup against the new colormap  this didnt work because some rgb combos dont exist in the new colormap  is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values or is there a simpler way to solve this problem  i tried using xinitcolormap but couldnt get that to work either  any help would be appreciated   don lemoine naval surface warfare center dahlgren division dahlgren va 00000 0000000000 dlemoinxobunswcnavymil

   i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif but im hoping  is really just a mistake on my part  does anyone know anything about  this problem     i am using an xmtextfield and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded    text string ascii or kanji either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring    the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed the text is getting    truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables    lang more specifically lcall  when they are set to japanese    the text gets truncated  when they are set to english everything    works fine  i am taking the default for xmncolumns    please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual     application just in my sample code to make things easier     i am running motif 00 x00r0 via hpux000  my test program is set up    to handle 00 bit kanji characters  i have remembered to do       xtsetlanguageproc prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources    are set to japanese fonts     dont know if this matters but my dialog box and textfield is initially    created with uil       the problem does not happen with xmtext  unfortunately substituting  xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable  alternative way too much code to be modified while in beta    i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone  wants it  my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not  properly allocating memory for japanese but since i dont have the  source to look at it is just a guess  the problem was that textfield was improperly walking the string it used the character count instead of the byte count a significan oops  the problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic patch from hp support services  tom mcfarland tommccvhpcom

    if i use xt all   oreilly has to say is is automatically handled by xt  if i use xlib ala xnextevent i get nothing  this all stems from problems with users of   the sun 00 keyboard and the numlock plus various altmetaetc modifier   requirements  thats not all it says  the coverage of modifiers is in chapter 0 of volume four or chap 0 in older athena editions where there is about  00 pages on how to specify translations to capture various combinations of keys or buttons  the xlib route uses xlookupstring and there is a lot of coverage of how that works in volume one  chapter 0  you should read this to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything complicated  adrian nye oreilly and associates

  i just got a bug report and a fix for this exact problem from fisheriscpbellcorecom greg fisher    the most serious problem i have identified has not  been incorporated  this problem occurs when the table widgets  geometrymanager is invoked by a child  this will work correctly if  the table widgets parent complies with the xt protocols  however if  they do not as is the case for some motif widgets and they ignore  xtcwqueryonly then the sizing will be incorrect          in order to see this problem the following events must  happen  0 a child of the table widget must request a new size  0 the table widget must query its parent for a new size having set     xtcwqueryonly  0 the parent must ignore the xtcwqueryonly bit and resize the table     widget  as part of the resize xmptableforgetproposedlayout is     called  this will set twtablecurrentcols and     twtablecurrentrows to zero  0 the table will continue setting up the new size working under the     assumption that it is working with a proposed and not actual     layout  at the end it will call xmptablesaveproposedlayout  this     will save twtablecols and twtablerows and restore their     values from twtablecurrentcols and twtablecurrentrows     however these have already been set to zero  0 since the table widget has already been resized it will not need a     second resize  0 next another widget managed by some ancestor of the table is     resized  this results in the parent of the table requesting the     tables preferred size  since twtablecols and twtablerows are     zero this will return 0x0 as the preferred size  0 the parent is very likely to grant this request resulting in a     loss of the whole table from the display    he isolated the problem a proposed a workaround which seems precisely correct  here is the new implementation of xmptablenewproposedlayout which will be released with the next update in 0 weeks  xmptablec  void xmptablenewproposedlayout tw      xmptablewidget tw      xmptableconsidersamesize       tw      xmptableproposedcolsandrows    tw      xmptablequeryparentforresize   tw      query only no resize              since we only made a query we should still need to continue       however motif is broken so that we actually may already have       been resized  in that case the proposed layout is already       forgotten so we should just quietly exit           if  twtableresizestatus  rsduetorequest               xmptablemakecolsfitquerywidth  tw          xmptablemakerowsfitqueryheight tw          xmptablegetproposedchildsize   tw          xmptablesaveproposedlayout     tw            else the resize has already been done  our proposed layout would       have been forgotten in the process         the xptable the fix is identical except of course for the names  xptablec  void xptablenewproposedlayout  tw      xptablewidget  tw      xptableconsidersamesize       tw      xptableproposedcolsandrows    tw      xptablequeryparentforresize   tw      query only no resize             since we only made a query we should still need to continue       however some manager widgets are broken so that we actually may       already have  been resized  in that case the proposed layout       is already forgotten so we should just quietly exit           if  twtableresizestatus  rsduetorequest               xptablemakecolsfitquerywidth  tw          xptablemakerowsfitqueryheight tw          xptablegetproposedchildsize   tw          xptablesaveproposedlayout     tw            else the resize has already been done  our proposed layout would       have been forgotten in the process          david smythdavidjpldevvaxjplnasagov senior software engineer0000000000 do not use vmail yet cccp x and object guruoffice 000c000 jet propulsion lab ms 0000000 0000 oak grove drive pasadena ca 00000   that sun windows thingy whats it called  you know its really awful  x  motif  thats it  motif yuck

   in article 0000qdeckcom supportqdeckcom technical support writes in article 0qtk00rn0picassocsscsydtansucomau gpatapisboydtansucomau writes  what sort of traffic is generated with the xcalls  i am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running dvx is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response time  anyone have any ideas     i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network itself to give you a realworld example here at quarterdeck we have roughly 000 people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell file servers and each other its not too much of a load on our ethernet with maybe 0 concentrators so you have 0000 people on each segment if you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns  but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a 000 00 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have 00 people running programs off it youre going to see some slowdowns because youre now on effectively a 00 mhz 000 of course dvx will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have 00 working programs running youll know it   well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the  significant drop in price year after year  the link i want to use  though isdn 00k is costly and the bandwidth limited  thats why my interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic  goes through it  since i dont think tom always gets time to read this group ill take the liberty of responding to some of this  if you really want tom to reply you should send mail to supportqdeckcom  a 00k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 00mbps ethernet that we typically run  how restrictive it will be depends on  what you run and how you run it  i would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like smoking clover would make the link  useless for anyone else  on the other hand probably 00 xclocks quietly updating every 00 seconds or so wouldnt impact it too much  in the real world you will be somewhere in between these two extremes  going by the way i personally use x on a daily basis i wouldnt want to have to share that 00k link with more than 00 other people  having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing you could probably run 0000 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth  hmmm  has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all  are you running any standard mswindows programs like word   what sort of  packets go blazing through what size link do you have 0mb or 00mb  what is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you have few high peaks and then many low points  our corporate wan is as unique as any other  the usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave  the only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a 00k link to ireland that they often use to run a dos text based client end of a clientserver database  remotely from the dvx machine behind me since the server end is or was always at this end california it is faster to remotely run the client via desqview x and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server  as i warned you this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a 00k isdn link  running word for windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent lets break it into pieces and look at it  tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from windows calls into x popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic  restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be  does the server that its displaying on have backing store  if so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic if no backing store then what was being covered up  if it was a  solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily  if it was a full color backdrop of ren  stimpy we may have to send it back to the x server bit by bit  dvx will do its level best to only redraw that small area but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be  repainted  assuning a 0000x000 screen with 0 bits per pixel thats 0000000 bits that has to be sent  worst possible case youre looking at about 00 seconds in reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts  that will be tranlatable into higher level x calls    it all really depends on what the programs are doing ie youre going to see a slowdown from xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also    what do you mean by network things  i vision using ms windows and other windows applications over the network were the processes are running on the server and all i am getting are the displays  i am wondering how  good is the x and subsequently dvx protocol in transferring these  images with xcalls and displaying them on a clients machine  x was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network  its  pretty good for this  x programs are best dos text programs are almost as good since we conert them to x easily  something like winx is a hybrid we intercept the calls windows makes to its graphics driver mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to x  the calls windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network  we go to a  lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level xlib calls we can but we are somewhat limited because we only know what windows and its applications tell us      quarterdeck office systems

   why did x designers decide to not associate the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the display it is being drawn on  in x00 the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing requests  that is the servers drawing model was stateless  this caused problems with performance and network traffic so the x00 redesign included the graphic context to codify the drawing state  most application designers who want to draw things in several different colors create a gc for each color during initialization then pass the gc id in each drawing request  for more information see scheifler and gettyss article in the 0000 acm transactions on graphics

    most graphics systems i have seen have drawing routines that also specify  a color for drawing like    drawpointxycolor or drawlinex0y0x0y0color or  fillrectanglex0y0x0y0color     with x i have to do something like   xsetforegroundcurrentcolor  xdrawpointdwxy    why split this into two functions why did x designers decide to not associate  the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the  display it is being drawn on  for flexibility anyway what you say is not really true the color information is associated with a graphicscontext not with a display and the gc is a parameter to the drawing routines  so if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of width 0 you can make 0 gcs for those cases and then simply do  xdrawlinedpywingcredx0y0x0y0 xdrawlinedpywingcbluex0y0x0y0  for this effect  this is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer but also much more efficient and flexible you would not include all the other parameters like line pattern with cap and joinstyle drawmode and so on in every drawing call so why do it for color  btw stay away from xdrawpoint if you dont really need it to draw random points for image transfers there are image routines   oo  o                   brain inside                         o   o                                                 o   o  andre beck abpsoft mehl andrebeckirsinftudresdende  o  oo

   hi ive just installed the new xarchie 000 and it all works fine except  on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the program dont work at all but on the bw terminal it works fine i can set the icon to an xbm file with twmrc but that doesnt give the neato change when busy action other programs with similar actions eg xmail xbiff work fine  the xinterface author george ferguson suggests it might be a problem with the x intrinsics but isnt willing to hack around to fix it himself but i know zero about x programming so i dont think i can find it   does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem  andrew    andrew jaffe                                     ajaffeoddjobuchicagoedu dept of astronomy and astrophysics u chicago 0000 s ellis ave                                000 0000000 chicago il 000000000                           000 0000000 fax  
   i am using xdm on x00r0 with ow0 and xview0 on sun0s and sparcs running   sunos 000  prior to using xdm i used to set path and other environment  variables like manpath helppath arch etc in my login file  with xdm  the login file doesnt get executed and therefore neither the olwm  rootwindow nor my applications know about these variables       you  should  try  having  a  xsession  script in home to do these things  xdm will  start  up  your  process  using  the  system  version usually usrlibx00xdmxsession which should check whether you have your won and change to that if you do  take a copy of the  system  one and edit it        note that this file requires x access to be set   gordon lack  the contents of this message may reflect my personal opinion  they are not intended to reflect those of my employer or anyone else

   our group is interested in using a pixmap format for multicolored iconsbuttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from resource files using pbmplus we can easily move tofrom xpm to our other environments of mswindows and os0 pm  we were wondering if xpm or some other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the x consortium for r0 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by x   along the same subject line is the reason the standard x pixmap is not used because it doesnt have an associated colormap and other attributes or is it more involved just wondering why there arent editors for pixmaps out there for the original format  email replies preferred thanks in advance  john sigler      texas instruments email siglerhp000itgticom standard disclaimers go here  
                 evolution of sco newsgroups and mailing lists                       many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful    information on sco open desktop since 0000

  we are adding a motif wrapper to a family of data display programs  these programs are each written as a main loop with these steps  use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data   otherwise block new data comes quite often  use msgop to check for messages and if true read them   otherwise continue messages are user commands and not often  update the display according to latest data and messages  we typically have several of these running in windows plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run  xt and xm also have a main loop model that we must fit into oreilly vol iv ch 0 discusses adding a filewatcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time  we can openup our existing main loop and call it as a workproc the problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate neither is letting the program freerun because others are hurt  the unix select call lets you block until any of several io are ready we want that for the x main loop except not file io any suggestions or examples most welcome  we run sgi personal iris and indigo systems  morris hirsch aka morrissg00nuscnavymil or 000 000 0000

      these are two common subjects so i hope someone has had to deal with these    specific questions     0  question 0 deleted     0  i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right    of my main window  i want it at the same y coord and their rightleft    sides touching  what i need to ask for is the xy coord of the window     managers border for the main window  this should ring a bell with anyone    who has called xtmovewidget immediately checking the xy after the move    and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the xy    and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border     any help would be most appreciated     darcy    darcymccallummentorgcom  i have done this before but im not sure i used the best approach although i tried several methods  you have to run up the window heirarchy using xquerytree until you get to the root window  now this is not so simple because some window managers slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window so be sure to take that into account for further calculations  calculate the position and widthheight offsets for each window using xgetgeometry  be sure to take the borderwidth into consideration remember a windows borderwidth is on the outside of a window so the windows xywidthheight must be adjusted accordingly  all of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the windowmanager is using  now to place the new window you have to use the same numbers to calculate  where you want to place it because the windowmanager will reparent it on the outside of where you place your window if i remember correctly  disclaimer all of this is from memory and i no longer have the code  but i did get it working under several window managers correctly  feel free to call or email for further info                mcgary    mike d mcgary                voice 000 0000000 intellection                  fax   000 0000000 0000 lbj freeway suite 000   arpa  mcgaryintellectioncom dallas texas 00000           uucp  intellectioncommcgarycsutexasedu  
  i have been using a hds xterminal and really like it what is really powerful is that it can run the x server without running a window manager one can then run a special client x program called a window manager either 0 run  motif or openlook from its own firmware limiting the network traffic  but having no home or 0 run motif or openlook from some home place like a sparc or vms  this is powerful especially since i can exit one window manager without killing windows and then start up another manager some of my vms tools need special metamouse combos that work in one manager and not the other  well the question is    on a sparcstation running openlook does anyone know how to   break apart olwm from the olwmslave program basically i   want to run only the server and go somewhere else to run   the window manager   please respond my email as well as posting because of the large volumes in windowx  thanks      scott moody   000 0000000   there are no answers  just cross references      scottshuksanboeingcom        uunetbcstecshuksanscott  
   three qs  0 is it reliable  i use it all day every day maintaining our ftp site and answering mail via supportqdeckcom and i can honestly say that in the last few months ive never had my machine go down due to any sort of tcpip network manager instability of course ive crashed my machine quite a few times on purpose during beta testing and that sort of thing but the tcpip portion is quite stable  however keep in mind that dvx and the network managers are only going to be as stable as the software they sit on top of so if your underlying network kernel is flakey you cant expect dvx to be terribly stable  0 how does it send the information from a ms windows app over the x00 protocol does it just draw everything as graphics into one window or does it use multiple windows and essentially work more cleverly  it just goes as a window that has graphics drawn into it to vastly oversimplify what goes on we just take the windows graphics api calls and translate them directly to xprotocol unfortunately windows was not really written to be networkaware so sometimes we see a speed penalty when an app does something stupid like sending a big white bitmap to erase something rather than just drawing a white box fortunately that sort of thing is rare  0 if i want to run ms word for example remotely do i have to run a separate copy of ms windows remotely and then start ms word from that or can ms word be started remotely on its own  you need to run ms windows which word then runs inside you could run multiple windows programs within the one winx window and windows has ways to automagically start winapps when you start windows so in practice its not really a major problem i have my system set up so that i can run winx which automatically starts word fullscreen for windows so i never see any part of windows but word           quarterdeck office systems  internet support  tom bortels  pricingordering  infoqdeckcom    tech questions  supportqdeckcom   bbs 000 0000000  fax 000 0000000  compuserve go quarterdeck anonymous ftp qdeckcom 00000000 leave your email address as password

  i recently corrected the resolution on my sparcstation by changing usrlibx00xdmxservers from 0 local usrbinx00x 0 ar0 000 dpi 000 to 0 local usrbinx00x 0 ar0 000 dpi 00  i determined that my 00 0000x000 monitor was 00 dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution  however this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely after some research i believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by family weight slant and pointsize  i believe that x is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it  since i have only 00dpi and 000dpi fonts on my path the results are inaccurate  i do have some speedo fonts but not for the family i am using helvetica  i think this is incorrect  the fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display  this never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres  this is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts  for instance the command  xfd fn bitstreamcharter000  will invoke a 00dpi font despite the fact that this is a speedo font  the command    xfd fn adobecourier000  will invoke a 00dpi font or a 000dpi font depending on my font path despite the fact that x knows my display is 00 dpi and that it can generate an 00dpi font for me  unless i my applications specifies a resolution x appears to pick a stupid default  is this a bug  is it a feature  if so why  is there anything i can do to get around this problem  people have suggested that i lie about my resolution and specify a single font path 00 or 000 not both this would at least make my app consistent but i like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say yup thats an inch  anyone have a set of 00dpi bitmapped fonts i can use  system info sun sparc 0000 w00 mb sunos 000  xdpyinfo version number    000 vendor string    mit x consortium vendor release number    0000 screen 0   dimensions    0000x000 pixels 000x000 millimeters   resolution    00x00 dots per inch  xset q font path   usrlibx00fontsmiscusrlibx00fontsspeedousrlibx00fonts000dpiusrlibx00fonts00dpi   thanks           rbrodersoraclecom       bob brodersen 0000000000 applications architect applications technology group applications division                   oracle corporation redwood shores ca 00000

   hi im new to this group so please bear with me    two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation  of raster files with sunview becoming rapidly obselete ive  finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview  i put together a quick test and ive found that xputimage  is considerably slower factor of 0 on average than the  sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory  pixrects to a canvas this was on a sparc ipx it seems that  0 the x protocol communication is slowing things down or  0 xputimage is inefficientor both my question is what  is the fastest way in x00r0 to dump 0 plane image data to  a window can i take advantage of the fact that the client is  running on the same machine as the server or am i stuck with  xputimage in which case i might as well give up now    all help appreciatedthanks    derek    the fastest way is to use an x server with shared memory extension it uses shared memory if it is a local x server hence images dont have to be duplicated and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension is not available or if its  not the localhost  sriram

  dear netters     could you mail the source code of the book     advanced x window application programming by johnson and reichard      to me      if you need any source code just ask me      thank you very much                                       sincerely                                      zeng qiyong   zengqiyong suny at buffulo  
  given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice i would say that the shareware notice is unenforceable  all you need to do is make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed under the first part of the copyright notice  of course this would be circumventing the authors wishes on the subject but id say if youre not going to pay him no matter what youd be on relatively safe ground with that approach  in fact given the internal contradictions of the copyright notices id guess none of it could ever be enforced but not being a lawyer i cant be positive  regardless the fees hes asking are not excessive and i would encourage anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible  even though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the author it would be reasonable to do so to support his efforts if nothing else   brad    brad daniels  if money cant buy happiness danielsneosoftcom   i guess ill have to rent it i dont work for neosoft and weird al yenkovic dont speak for my employer

with some of the open look ui       features added      yes openwindows 0 will use dps instead of news  news is dead       this means tnt is dead too      xview and olit will be supported but probably not enhanced after the       next release  i dont know if there will be a source release of       xview 00 or not      the cose environment will include at least some of suns deskset       ported to

specification of a graphical user interface gui     a gui determines the look and feel of a system  the shape of     windows buttons and scrollbars how you resize things how you     edit files etc      the open look gui is specified developed and maintained jointly by     sun microsystems and att or usl      see also bibliography   what is openwindows     openwindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the open look     graphical user interface specifications  its compatible with the     x00 window system from mit as well as currently suns news and sunview     so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems     it comes from sun and also with system v release 0 from certain vendors     openwindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews after the     program used to start it and the main executable itself respectively     it should not be called windows or open look or openlook as     these terms are either wrong or apply to something else     a commerical openwindows source licence costs about 0000 for the server     plus about 00000 for deskset and another 00000 for tooltalk     the current versions of openwindows for various platforms are sunos 000 on sun 0 00 solaris 0x sunos 00x on sparc 00 solaris 00 sunos 0 on sparc 000      see also mixing x00 and openwindows where can i get it   what are olit xview and tnt     these are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs     that conform to the open look specifications  see the bibliography     for documentation on the individual toolkits  heres a brief summary      olit was atts open look intrinsics toolkit for the x window system     it used a widget set and was probably the easiest for people who were     already x00xt programmers to learn  you could buy the source from att     although you didnt get the same version tht sun ship  sun includes the     olit library in openwindows qv it is also often included in     system v release 0  it was written in c  the release of olit in     openwindows 00 was olit 00  olit support passed to usl then a     division of att now owned by novell who replaced it with moolit qv     note that because of the nature of xt subclassing you will probably     want or need olit source in order to develop a large application or     anything else that uses subclasses     see the proceedings of the 0000 x technical conference      xview is suns toolkit for x00 written in c  xview is similar in     programmer interface to sunview  theres even a shell script to help     migrate source code from sunview to xview xview is often said to be     the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with x windows     the xview toolkit is included in openwindows and full source is     available by anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu and elsewhere     the current version of xview from sun is 00     despite rumours to the contrary  some even from within sun  the     xview toolkit is not about to be dropped by sun  xview will be     included in the next release of openwindows unlike news     on the other hand the xview toolkit is not likely to receive as much     attention from sun in the future as olit      the news toolkit tnt was an objectoriented programming system based     on the postscript language and news  tnt implements many of the     open look interface components required to build the user interface of     an application  its currently included in openwindows      the current version of tnt from sun is 00 release 0 contains some     incompatibilities with tnt 00 and tnt 00 but sun are committed to     supporting the api at least until they stop news support some time     later this year and replace it with display postscript  wail     you might ask what is committed to means in this context the     answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing     sun currently asserts that it is committed to olit however      the c user interface toolkit uit consists of an objectoriented c     class library layered on top of xview and a tool to generate code from     devguide 0 gil files  the uit also includes features that simplify     event management and the use of postscript and color  it is said to be     compatible with openwindows v0 and v0 and presumably v000 since the     release mentions that it works on solaris 0     uit is not an official sunsupported product but an ongoing project of     various people within sun  it can be found on exportlcsmitedu in     the mit contrib directory as uitv0tarz use binary mode   where does motif fit in     it doesnt   motif is an alternative graphical user interface that     is being developed by osfit has a look and feel reminiscent of     microsoft windows and the os0 presentation manager  there are no non     commercial motif toolkits available although the motif source is sold     reasonably cheaply by osfalthough motif is currently available on     more platforms than openwindows the open look gui is almost certainly     used on many more machines simply because sun and sysvr0 have such a     large installed base     suns cdware volume 0 contains a roadmap for improving motif     applications by converting them to olit  there are also notes in     the periodic table olit demo openwinhomedemoolittable   what is moolit     moolit is a version of olit from attusl that lets users choose between     a motif and an open look ui feel at runtime  it will be part of system v     release 00     contact joanne newbauer jouslcom 000 0000000   what about that display postscript thing     sun and adobe have agreed that sun will include the dps extension to x     in the next release of openwindows  dps is essentially a badly designed     hack on top of a slow level 0 postscript interpreter intended to give a     very small subset of the functionality of news whilst simultaneously     being harder to use as i understand it  the only real advantage it     has over news is that the manual is much smaller being generally less     complete dps is also available on more kinds of machine     performance on our rs0000 is not suitable for interactive work     what it will be like on the sparcstation remains to be seen     note that whereas xnews fonts are shared by both subsystems the dps     extension to x does not make type 0 postscript fonts available to     ordinary x00 programs  it is not like atm on a pc in this regard     there is at least one thirdparty version which does make fonts     available however    what are olwm and olvwm     they are window managers  a window manager is the part of the x window     system eg x00 that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows     on the screen and for managing the users interaction with the windows      olwm is the standard open look window manager     its included with all of the openwindows qv implementations and     you can also get the source by ftp since sun donated it      olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a virtual desktop hence the     v in its name  it shows a little map on the screen with the     currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle you can     move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys  this     lets you run several clients applications and move the display around     from one to the other  olvwm was derived from the openwindows 00 olwm     by scott oaks you need to have xview 00 to compile it     get olvwm from an ftp site such as exportlcsmitedu in the contrib     directory there are three patches   can i use my favorite window manager with openwindows instead of olwm     yes  if you use twm for example or mwm you wont be able to use     the pin and unpin feature of olwm and you probably wont see the     footers some windows use to display certain messages      if you use twm youll want to use the fdelete function to unpin menus     and get rid of programs that dont have a quit button when not run     under olwm     for twm put this in your hometwmrc lefttitlebutton target  fdelete     where target is a 00x00 icon from usrincludex00bitmaps     alternatively try  add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm lefttitlebutton menu  fmenu olmenu  menu olmenu      quit         fdelete       for mwm you can doubleclick on the menu icon on the left of the title     bar to dismiss a popup window i am told      see the manual page for your window manager twm etc    can i use olwm and olvwm without openwindows or on an x terminal     the openwindows xnews server combines sunview news postscript and x00     this means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems     unfortunately it means that some openwindows programs need either news     or sunview support and thus wont run on an x terminal  this includes     pageview in particular      you can use olwm or olvwm see above on an x terminal or a nonopen     windows display and most open look clients eg olit or xview ones     will work perfectly well  you may find that you get complaints about     fonts not being found  if so see the fonts section below     if you are running the window manager builtin to an ncd terminal you     may have problems with input focus setting input true in the terminals     xdefault file in usrlibx00xdm may or may not help          what configuration files do i need to know about      xinitrc and xsessionrc      the first time you run openwindows a xinitrc file will be created in     your login directory home  if it already exists you might have to     edit it somewhat its simplest to move it and any other old x00 files     you have to another directory and then merge the old and new files      if your site uses xdm you should use xsession instead of xinitrc     since xdm doesnt look at your xinitrc file      openwininit openwinmenu and openwinsys      these are optional files you can create in your home directory     depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use     look in openwinhomelib normally usropenwinlib for these files     without the leading  and copy any you want to change  you may need     to edit your xinitrc to get them recognized  if you are not on an     x terminal you will want to run a console window such as cmdtool c     shelltool c xterm c or chuck muscianos contool program so that     system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen     note that openwinsys is not executed unless you edit xinitrc      xdefaults      you can put x windows resource specifications in here  in particular     it is a good idea to include at least openwindowsfocusleniencetrue input true     these allow nonicccmcompliant programs to receive input even if they     forget to ask for it      props the program that runs when you select properties from the default     root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choices into xdefaults     dont put comments in xdefaults since props deletes them      startupps      this is the news user profile file read by openwindows actually xnews     on startup this is documented in the news programming manual near the     back  the most useful thing to put here is postscript code to change     the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a     syntax error in the postscript means that xnews will either not start up     at all or will get broken in strange waysthe news manual gives code     that is both incorrect and insufficient     warning things in this file rarely work on both openwindows 0 and 0      note that the mouse speed is best set in your xinitrc with xset m see     the man page for xset man xset and xset help for more information      heres what homestartupps  should look like if you want a delay of     about a third of a second 000000 microseconds and a repeat rate of     twenty or so keys per second 00000 microseconds between repeats for     openwindows 0  youll have to experiment a bit because the repeattime     is the delay between keys sent and thus doesnt include the time to     process each key which is probably higher on my 0000 than on your     supersparc 0000 gti injection   again this is for openwindows 0   dont want the demos  see p xxxii of news toolkit reference manual  includedemos false def  userprofile begin     keyrepeatthresh 0 000000 timeval storetimeval def     keyrepeattime 0 00000 timeval

beginpackage tnt 0 0 findpackage beginpackage  classrepeatkeys pop force repeatps to autoload  endpackage endpackage endpackage      if you change these parameters you can test them without restarting the     openwindows server like this  psh i startupps welcome to x00news version0  psh i welcome to x00news version0 classinit classrepeatkeys send  now press controld      you can also either of these two files startupps and userps to make     the root window be retained so that a postscript drawing on the     background wont be erased when you move windows frambuffer retained true put     will do this  note that this may increase the amount of memory used     by the news server xnews dramatically          see also trouble shooting it wont let me type trouble shooting is there an easy way to edit xdefaults environment variables   how can i configure open look for a lefthanded mouse and keyboard     you can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons but be prepared for one     or two occasional surprises  see also man 0 xview for a list of     keybindings you can change at least for xview programs      with openwindows 00 you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings     and then let sunview handle them  the status returned by svenv should     tell you whether your server is running under sunview or not put this     in your xinitrc      if eval svenv env     then xmodmap

but     effective screen saver  see man screenblank     under solaris 0 youll need to copy screenblank from an older system as     its not supplied  then add a new file in etcrc0d to make the system     run screenblank automatically    how do i cut and paste between xterm and openwindows programs      to go from xterm to textedit say      select the text you want to copy by dragging the select mouse button       in xterm      press copy in the xterm this key is l0 or metac the oreilly       xview manual gets this wrong      move to the textedit window and press paste l0 or metav      if this doesnt work see trouble shooting cut and paste     to go the other way from textedit to xterm      select the text in textedit  no need to use copy      move to the xterm window and press adjust the middle mouse button      you can also use the copycut and paste buttons   copypaste is boring what shortcuts are available      quick copy within textedit mailtool etc      click select to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go      press and hold down the paste or cut button      select the text you want to copymove  youll see that its underlined       or crossed out as appropriate  in the jed demo it goes grey      let go of the paste or cut button      the text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret      drag and drop to move a selection      select the text you want to copy or move by dragging or multiple       clicking the select or adjust mouse button      put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection      press and hold down down the select mouse button and move the mouse       pointer a little to the right youll see the cursor changes to be the       first 0 letters of the text or some other icon      still holding select down move the mouse over the point where you want       to drop the text      you may see the mouse pointer change to a riflesight or target to show       that its ok to drop things here      let go of select and the text is movedthis works in text fields of       dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows      drag and drop to copy a selection      this is the same as using drag and drop to move a selection except that       you must hold the control key down as well as the select mouse button   what are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere      see the man page for textedit0 for some of them     in general the editingmoving commands go in the opposite direction when     shifted  eg ctrlw deletes a word and ctrlw deletes the word to the     right of the insert

under either solaris 00 or 00 im not sure which     or not yet in other words      if you have framemaker there is a utility to import them im told     the 00 fonts supplied with openwindows are fully hinted though and     comparing them to the microsoft windows and apple truetype fonts is     interesting  the f0 font format is described in a publication from the     sun openfonts group listed in the bibliography below  documentation on     the unbundled version of typescaler is also available from sun openfonts      you can buy f0 fonts from sunpics monotype linotype urw and probably     other major foundries      sunpics newsprint software supports type 0 fonts   improving font rendering time     although the sun type renderer typescaler is pretty fast its not as     fast as loading

mftobdf from the seetex distribution to convert tex pk fonts to     x00 bdf format which you can then use with either x00 or oenwindows      you can also use der mouses getbdf to get bdf fonts from a

item   cut copy and paste dont work at all openwindows only     oh dear  use ps xuaww  grep xv  to check that svxvselsvc is running     and that either you or root started it depending on whether you started     openwindows with openwin or by logging in through xdm     if not start it  if it dies check that there is no tmpsvxvselsvc     before restarting it  you may need to be root to remove it or you can     reboot your workstation     check that there is space in tmp use df tmp and also see if there     are a lot of files there with names like tmpttytxta00000 if there are     several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it times out      quit any deskset tools such as mailtool filemgr and cm calendar start     a terminal emulator and remove and tmpttytxt and tmptext files     that are still there  its simplest to quit openwin and start it again     after doing that if cut and paste was broken but if it starts working     again you can just carry on  note that files in tmp not owned by you     might be in use by another worker comrade so dont remove those without     checking first       if you get error messages that look like xlib  connection to 00 refused by server xlib  internal error during connection authorization check error cant open display     try on the machine running openwindows or x00 xhost machine     where machine is the computer on which you ran the command that failed     if you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you     using your display you will have to type the bizarrelooking xhost hostname     or xhost happyboy if happyboy is the name of your workstation     this lets any user on happyboy access your display      with openwindows 00 you can also use xauth and the programmers guide      describes how to do this in chapter 0 p 000  this is more secure     also check the man page for fbtab0 to stop other users accessing the     framebuffer directly      also note that there is a sun patch for openwindows 00 under sunos 000     to fix a serious security problem  it is available through your local     sun answer center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftpuunet     00000000 system in

that lets you change or     disable the list of hosts that can access the display      if you start getting this message after youve been logged in overnight     there might be a cron job thats removing the unix sockets in tmp     that are used to communicate with the server when display doesnt have     a hostname before the  or is empty  have the system administrator     change the cron script to skip sockets    i get console error messages on my screen and they dont go away sun 0 or 0     if refresh makes the messages vanish but new ones come along later you need to run xterm c from your xinitrc or start one up in the background and then  choose save workspace from the workspaceutilities menu  better still pick up contool and run that  get it from exportlcsmitedu in the contrib directory  it will monitor the console and open flash its icon or beep when a message appears its very easy to configure      if refresh from the workspaceutilities menu doesnt make the messages     go away a sun with a cg0 frame buffer has two screens  you can move the mouse off the righthand by default edge of the screen and onto a whole new but monochrome display called 00  see the man page for openwin i have a shell script that checks for this and if theres a devcgfour0 does openwin dev devcgfour0 dev devbwtwo0 if you are running x00 or openwindows 0 you might need to add this to your xinitrc or other startup file      eval svenv display unix00 env     olvwm display unix00   later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically you can also run switcher e 0 to get rid of the messages  also see the note about contool above   is there an easy way of editing xdefaults     use props which appears in the default root menu as properties     this starts props a property editor which will rewrite your     xdefaults after removing comments  it then applies any changes     keep comments by using comment instead of  for example commentfont palatinoitalic00   how do i get the file manager to use emacs instead of textedit     set the default editor to sh c exec emacs font lucidasanstypewriter00 file     you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one   how do i run openwindows in inverse video     this tends not to work under openwindows 0 with opwnwindows 00     there are various ways including using bg and fg options  if youre     using openwindows 0 on a sun 0  probably the best you can do short of     upgrading the workstation to a sparc is to use xterm instead of cmdtool   why dont flat checkboxes work     a known bug may make guides output dump core if you use these     a workaround is to edit the guide output as its only guides output     thats broken not the actual checkbox code     this applies only to versions of devguide before devguide 00  if youre     still using an ancient devguide you should upgrade as soon as possible     the new one is fantastic   when i leave openwindows my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays   on the screen     try running clearcolormap if this helps put it as the last line in     the shell script you use to start openwindows eg openwin   when i use snapshot the system crashes or the server hangs or something     this was a bug related to some systems only  the only workround was to     use some other screen dump program such as xwd xv 000 or xgrabsc       why have some of my function keys stopped working     keys f00 and f00 changed from sunf00 and sunf00 to sunxkf00 and sunxkf00     respectively in openwindows 0  applications must be recompiled or you     might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to     change your keyboard layout back again   when i type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit i get the sunview version     see under trouble shooting strange error messages below      see also next item   mixing x00 and openwindows     see also next item      note that openwindows 00 includes the x00r0 core distribution to patch     level 00 but not the contrib directory  these notes apply to     openwindows 00 although you could also the do same sort of thing with     openwindows 00 and x00r0      install the x00 libraries in usrlibx00you can intermix openwindows     and x00r0 or x00r0 theyre all compatible in this respect     put the x00 binaries in for example usrbinx00      put usrbinx00 last in your path so that you get openwindows versions     of programs instead of x00 ones where appropriate although this is a     matter of preference  in any event put the openwindows bin directory     first  see the preceding item for more details on that  if you have     bin or usrbin theyre the same directory on sunos earlier in     your path than openwinhomebinxview youll get sunview programs instead     of openwindows ones      set ldlibrarypath so that usropenwinlib is last after the x00     library directorythis doesnt matter with openwindows 00 but with     older versions youll get error messages from x00 programs if you dont     do this  the messages are generally harmless see next item although     xdm core dumps if this isnt right      set openwinhome to the directory containing openwindows if it isnt     usropenwin      see also environment variables especially xfilesearchpath   i get error messages on my screen about ldso libx00so0 not found     set ldlibrarypath to be usropenwin  if you also use x00 use      usrlibusr0libusropenwinlib     if you put this in a shell script or your profile use     openwinhomeusropenwinlib instead of usropenwin this is for     binsh for csh it is different   i launch my

running openwindows to use answerbookit wont run under     x00 on an x terminal or on anything else because it uses news to draw     the postscript text and pictures     if you are using openwindows 00 you need to use the openwindows 00     compatible navigator its called navigatorow0 on the answerbook cdrom     if all answerbook users are using openwindows 00 you can replace     navigator wih navigatorow0 altogether rename the old one first to     satisfy your sense of paranoia     the navigatorow0 binary is also on cdware vol 0     note that the data files are in postscript so you can

patch   when i run several programs the colors on the screen all change when   i move into a different window colormap flashing          this is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time     however you can minimise the effect with the following procedure       start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve       run cmapcompact save        to create the owcolors file       put the line cmapcompact init        near the start of your startup file xinitrc       exit and then restart the window system       cmapcompact init will push those colors owcolors to the end of the colormap and reserves them      also note that controll0 locks the colors of the current window and     controll0 unlocks them  this is described in the olwm manual page   pageiew uses the wrong colors or makes the colormap flash see above     this problem was reported by people for some reason running the motif     window manager mwm with openwindows     try running pageview like this openwinhomebinreservecolors svmono openwinhomebinpageview openwinhomebinreservecolors discard   xdm breaks things     command tool doesnt like being run without a unix controlling

herenote that there is also a usenet     newsgroup alttoolkitsxview although it doesnt sem to have very     wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles     per monthyou should also look at the faq in compwindowsx   how do i set the font of individual scrolling list items     panellistfont takes an int rownumber and an xvopaque fonthandle     panellistfonts take a null terminated list of xvopaque fonthandles     there is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font     you have to make sure that you always specify panellistfont when you     insert a new row into that list or write a convenience function     insertrowlist row string that hides the nasty bits   how do i keep an xview popup window displayed after a button is pressed     in the button callback do         xvsetbutton panelnotifystatus xverror null     this will keep the window visible     you might also need to investigate the menunotifystatus attribute   how do i make an xview

can the best possible performance from x   windows on your workstation without purchasing more hardware    performance is a highly subjective issue  the individual user must   balance speed versus features in order to come to a personal   decision  therefore this document can be be expected to contain many   subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts    this document is specifically concerned with x  there are of course   many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation   however they are outside the scope of this document       people seriously interested in the whole area of system     performance might want to look at the oreilly nutshell handbook     system performance tuning by mike loukides  imho it contains a     wellwritten comprehensive treatment

maintains the informative and   well written compwindowsx frequently asked questions document   its focus is on general x information while this faq concentrates   on performance    the compwindowsx faq does address the issue of speed but only with   regards to the x server  the gist of that topic seems to be use x00r0 it is faster than r0   please see the x faq for complete details   window managers     there are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different   features and abilities  the choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features  at this   point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager     a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger   is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move   also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   windows                           joe english joetrysteroartcom    ive found that a good font for tiling is 0x00 aka   miscfixedmediumrnormal00000000000c00iso00000  it is   the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun 0000x000 screen   and still get two 00 column terminal windows sidebyside on the   display with no overlap  other font suggestions will be accepted   the x server   which server          make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware   if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x00 server    on my monochrome sun i havent noticed much difference between   the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it was pointed out to   me that xsunmono is about 000k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging             thanks to jonny farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk                         michael salmon michaelsalmoneosericssonse     how your server was compiled can also make a difference  jeff law   lawschirfcsutahedu advises us that on a sun system x should be   compiled with gcc version 0 or with the unbundled sun compiler   you can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not   using the bundled sunos compiler  i assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other highquality commercial   compilers on the market  locking the server into ram                  has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and   does not get paged  eg via a call to plock  does this help   performance at all  ive had one inquiry on this topic and a few   pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone   whos tried it  i am not in a position to give it a try     thanks to eric c claeys eccepermattcom       danny backx dbsunbimbe       juan d martin juandocnmuses  starting your server              joe english joetrysteroartcom      if you start up a lot of clients in your xsession or whatever sleep     for a second or two after launching each one  after i changed my     xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time     we have a heavily loaded system without much core though    this sounds crazy but i have confirmed that it works      warner losh impsolbournecom provided me with a good explanation of   why this works which i have summarized here      when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections  a lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts  this process touches a large number of     pages  any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory  if you     put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up      similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x     client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources     being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so     forth  all this activity is typically memory intensive  once this     initialization is done the process has reached a steady state     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages     by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     xinitrc  you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstations limited resources    this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation as there   are so many variables to be considered available ram local swap   space load average number of users on your system which clients   you are starting etc    currently in my xinitrc i have a situation like sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm      ive experimented with sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm      ive even tried sleep 0 exec startxclientsscript     and then in startxclientsscript i had sleep 0 exec xclock   sleep 0 exec xbiff   sleep 0 exec xterm   sleep 0 exec xterm         the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my xinitrc and had settled down     into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched     all of these yielded fairly comparable results and so i just stuck with   my current setup for its simplicity  you will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you  fonts      loading fonts takes time and ram  if you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use youll get speed increases in loadup time    one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one   large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients  or   at least all your heavily used clients  to use only those few fonts   client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server  this will also conserve server resources since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server        farrell mckay fbmptcburpptcbuozau         joe english joetrysteroartcom     eg my main xterm font is 0x00 so i also have twm set up to use 0x00   in all its menus and icons etc  twms default font is 0x00  since   i dont normally use 0x00 ive eliminated one font from my server    oliver jones ojroadrunnerpictelcom     keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs     if you will make extensive use of r0 scalable fonts use a font server  about the resources file                   keep your xresources  xdefaults file small  saves ram and saves     on server startup time          joe english joetrysteroartcom    one suggestion      in your xdefaults xresources file try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications  for example  reversevideo true      then separate your resources into individual clientspecific     resource files  for example homelibappdefaults  in your     login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath  setenv xuserfilesearchpath homelibappdefaultsn       the compwindowsx frequently asked questions faq contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work     ed      so when xterm launches it loads its resources from     appdefaultsxterm  xdvi finds them in appdefaultsxdvi     and so on and so forth  note that not all clients follow the same     xxxxx resourcefile naming pattern  you can check in your system     appdefaults directory often usrx00r0libx00appdefaults to     find the proper name and then name your personal resource files     with the same name      this is all documented in the xt specification pg 000  000     thanks to kevin samborn sambornmtkgccom          michael urban urbancobrajplnasagov              and mike long mikeleecornelledu      kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers    this method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits       easier to maintain  more usable       fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resourcemanager       property  as a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker since it doesnt have to load all your resources       applications only process their own resources never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them    it also has drawbacks       the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up  this doesnt seem to       make that much of a performance difference and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability  if you are modifying an       applications resource database you just need to rerun the       application without having to xrdb again       xrdb will by default run your xdefaults file through cpp  when       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs they will not       watch out for this        i had c style comments in my xdefaults file which cpp stripped       out  when i switched to this method of distributed resource       files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources  xt did not       provide any error message when it encountered the c style       comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted       processing the resource file        the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy eg ifdef       color  is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management       you may also run into some clients which break the rules  for       example neither emacs 00000 nor xvt 00 will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in xdefaults       when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored your client       will not find its resources  loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources            casey leedom caseygaussllnlgov    a possible compromise suggestion that i have and am planning on trying   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my   xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for   clients that i seldom use  define your display properly                   client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server  in   that situation rather than setting your display environment variable to    hostname00 where hostname is the name of your workstation you   should set your display variable to unix00 or 00  by doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests thanks to patrick j horgan pjh00rasamdahlcom    see the display names section of the x0 man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name    i dont think its stock mit but at least data general and hp have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the display isnt set specially       rob sartin 00opensisartinuunetuunet    jody goldberg jodyalgorithmicscom sent me an xlib patch to change   stock r0 to use local communication even if display is not properly set   i dont want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   nonmit patches and so have elected not to include it here  hopefully mit   will apply this minor 0 lines patch themselves  in the meantime if   you want to try it yourself email jody  ed   clients     if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running  think also   about the kind of programs you are running  for example  is there   a smaller clock program than xclock    unfortunately i havent really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word     suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   eg xclock xterm xbiff are welcome  ed    ive received some contradictory advice from people on the subject   of x client programs  some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly xlib based since xt xaw and other toolkits are rather   large  others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries  in   this case using a nonxt for example client program may actually   increase the amount of ram consumed    the upshot of all this seems to be dont mix toolkits  that is try   and use just athena clients or just xview clients or just motif   clients etc  if you use more than one then youre dragging in   more than one toolkit library    know your environment and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment    thanks to rob sartin

reducing the number of savelines   to reduce memory usage   oliver jones ojroadrunnerpictelcom    jonny farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk   0 xvt    suggested by richard hesketh rlh0ukcacuk     available exportlcsmitedu in contribxvt00tarz     if you dont need all the esoteric features of xterm then get    hold of xvt   it was written here just to save swap space as    xterm is rather a hog      this was written as a partial clone of xterm  you dont have to    rename your resources as xvt pretends to be xterm  in its current    version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm  ive heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature but ive not found any    yet     update march 0000  i recently had a few email conversations with    brian warkentin brianwarkentineengsuncom regarding xvt  he    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm  for    instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling    speed try this quickie benchmark bintime dd ifetctermcap    bs00 and see which program can scroll faster  also while xterm    may be slightly larger in ram requirements we dont have any hard    numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterms paging requirements are not that major     as an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it    made little difference since if you never use it it never gets    brought into memory     so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm  in summary  caveat emptor your mileage may vary    if you can provide some hard data id like to see it    specifically how much ram each occupies how much swap each needs    relative speed of each  0 mterm    suggested by der mouse mouselightningmcrcimmcgilledu

         suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster    from scott barman scottasdcom comes a suggestion regarding motif   text field widgets      i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets i     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes     particularly the initial one in the field  examining the what was     going on with xscope i found it  it seems that when the resource     xmnblinkrate is nonzero and the focus is on a text field widget     or even just a text widget the ibeam cursor will blink     every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the     widget code is making a request to the server copyarea  the user     can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to 0  it is not     noticeable on a 00mhz sparc but it does make a little difference     on a slower system    this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas  consider your heavily used clients are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server   requests   miscellaneous suggestions   pretty pictures           dont use large bitmaps gifs etc as root window backgrounds     the more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc     these take up ram and cpu power  i work on a sun sparc and im     conscious of performance issues i cant comprehend it when i see     people with a 0mb sun 000 running xphoon as their root window      ill let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation     if youre anything like me you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway         thanks to qiang alex zhao azhaocsarizonaedu  for reminding me of this one ed  a quicker mouse           using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse  i use xset m 0 00 in my xinitrc file   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist  see the xset man page for further ideas and information    hint sometimes you may want to slow down your mouse tracking for   fine work  to cover my options i have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window

00          programming thoughts              joe english joetrysteroartcom      to speed up applications that youre developing there are tons of     things you can do  some that stick out       for motif programs dont set xmfontlist resources for individual       buttons labels lists et al use the defaultfontlist or       labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highestlevel manager       widget  again stick to as few fonts as possible       better yet dont use motif at all  its an absolute pig       dont create and destroy widgets on the fly  try to reuse them       this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too       use a line width of 0 in gcs  on some servers this makes a huge       difference       compress and collapse multiple expose events  this can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one    francois staes franskiwiuiaacbe      just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily they suggested trying     out the gnuy malloc but i didnt find the time yet i did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the     differences were indeed very noticeable  somewhat 0 times faster     any confirmation on this from anyone  ed    andre beck andrebeckirsinftudresdende      unnecessary noexpose events      most people use xcopyareaxcopyplane as fastest blit routines but     they forget to reset graphicsexposures in the gc used for the     blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most     cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through its eventloop again and again     thousands of xchangegc requests      this gfx context switching is also seen in most handcoded xapps     where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed     again and again  xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching     and

programs     on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display goal reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server    im not in a situation where i can easily try this but i have received   the following confirmation    michael salmon michaelsalmoneosericssonse     i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big     difference i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion this     helps a lot on my poor little ss0 with only 00 mb it was     essential when i only had 0 mb    casey leedom caseygaussllnlgov      the x00 server and the client are competing for the same cpu as     your server when you run it on the same machine  not really a     major problem except that the x00 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing    timothy h panton thpwesthawkuucp      firstly it relies on the fact that most cpus are mostly idle xs     cpu usage is bursty  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpuintensive at the same time is small if they     are not then you get twice the cpumemory available for your     action      the second factor is that context switches are expensive using 0     cpus halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network typically 00k vs 0k for a pipe allowing     even fewer context switches   other sources of information

  im new to xlib programming im having a problem i hope someone here can help me with i create a window and i want it to have some background color say red and draw an oval in it further when i resize the window i want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window whether it is larger or smaller im using aixwindows on an rs0000  my problem is this when i resize the window only the original part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into everything else is a greythe oval tries to redraw itself but gets clipped i can see that it would be the right size if i could see all of it but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created  for example i start out the window at 000x000 in width and height if i resize it to 000x000 the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 000x000the rest is grey further the oval only shows up in that 000x000 area  what am i doing wrong how can i get a window to resize and redraw a  rescaled image in it to take up the full size of the window  second question could someone tell me what xaw and xmu are  thanks chris

  some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need and it seems that someone out there just might have done it  already  and can point me to some tools that would help what theyd like to do is given a window that is taking a long time to draw because either  the data  is  arriving  over a slow link or the display is across a slow link they would like to first paint a lowresolution version of  the picture  and then repaint it in higher resolution  thus the picture might first be generated in 00 resolution with each  0x0  square  of pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color  next each 0x0 square would be replaced by 0 0x0 squares finally the 0x0 version  would  be painted  since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link the lowres version obviously wouldnt be  transmitted as  a bitmap that wouldnt help at all  instead there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the  lowres  picture  as  a small  bitmap  and  blows up each pixel into a square sorta like the magnifier programs do  this brings up the question of whether the  x server  can help  that is when a window is opened is there a way to ask that a filter program be run to process the pixels  or  is  the only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process permission denied  and have it open a local window  it seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up such  a  program  remotely and then accepts bitmaps compressing each one by some amount and sending them to the remote program to  expand but  if  there is something that x itself can do to help its be nice to hear about it  i looked in several fms  but  if  its  there  i obviously  dont  know  the keywords   if someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all we might want to get a copy  oh yes this is to run on some suns  part of the idea  is  to  build demos  that  can  show such things as if this were run across say a 0000bps link this is how fast the pictures would appear  then  the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for    if the auto industry were like the computer industry a car would  now cost 0 would get 0000 miles to the gallon and at random times would explode killing all its passengers

   ive written an application for sparcstation 0 gx under openwindows 00  the application uses xview stuff to create my window and the sun xgl graphics library for rendering into the canvas  the application does realtime 0d animation but it does not update the the display fast enough im using notifysetitimer xview call to periodically kick off my update routine and its not happening fast enough i want it to update 00 times  second its only doing about 00 also it appears to be compute bound because if i run anything else while my appplication is up the update rate slows down even more  any ideas  thanks

   i have a problem which many of you might have run into  we use lots of  ascii terminals and use them to the max  meaning lots of attributes line  draw etc   now what i need to do is come up with a working xterm which  will emulate our advanced ascii terminals as closely as possible    this means needing all attributes to work including bold and line drawing  the only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in  which one is bold and the other normal while both have linedraw fixed  spacing and several sizes    the only standard fonts which work are the fonts like 0x00 and 0x00b under  misc  they work great except i need a font one size larger 00x00  now  00x00 works well but there is no bold counterpart    to make matters worse i need the fonts in some form i can use for tektronix  xterminals  it seems they like pcf format although i should be able to  convert a bdf format    anyone have any suggestions            mark a davis     lake taylor hospital  norfolk va 0000000000x000      sysadministrator  computer services    marktaylor  marktayloruucp       this would be tedious but if you have the time you could get the bdf file i can email it to you if you dont have it or dont have easy access  to the x source and could make your own bold font from this  since each glyph is just a bitmap you could write a program to convert each glyph to a bitmapreadable file use bitmap to make each glyph bold and convert the results back to bdf format  then use bdftopcf to create the pcf file  then stick the pcf in usrlibx00fontsmisc or wherever and include it in fontsdir and voila youll have what you need    ernie coskrey            000 0000000    ncr corporation  mcpd columbia erniecoskreycolumbiascncrcom           0000 platt springs road                                            west columbia sc 00000 im out there busting my buns every night  tell your old man to drag walton and lanier up and down the court for 00 minutes  roger murdoch copilot

releases readme  xm is a user interface framework for the c language built upon x00 and the xtoolkit it is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets xm was initially created for the motif widget set now support for the athena widgets was added applications created with xm run in both environments without changes although many nice features are only available when using motif in some situations xm extends the underlying toolkit ie providing a combobox borrowed from mswindows but never tries to replace it  data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases  xm has nothing common with motif besides the general idea to encapsulate motif widgets in c objects and the  in its name many ideas for the xm architecture came from digitalks smalltalk version which provides an easy to use framework for windowspmmac applications in the very first time of development i used the windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar smalltalk and xm dialogs   top level objects in xm  windows systemdialogs and toolboxes which use the automatic layout   feature of various composite widgets in motif and xaw  userdialogs which can be individually laid out with a user interface   builder a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this   distribution  controls children of top level objects statictext staticimage pushbutton checkbox radiobutton edit listbox combobox groupbox panearea drawing toolbar  the staticimage and all the button classes can display bw xbitmap format or color gif format pictures as an alternative to a label text  event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects xt callbacks to member functions of xm objects   commoninteractii is built upon the xm drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the commoninteract system research project of our institute in 0000 an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media ie sound alternative input devices if you are interrested look into the june 0000 issue of the joop sigs publications  journal of object oriented programming  there should be our paper about commoninteract but be aware that it is our state of the art from 0000 commoninteractii is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor it currently supports only drawing primitives lines rectangles circles but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also known problem the xm drawing class has no redrawing strategy always redraws the whole window even after minimal changes like selecting an object this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed   about this first release  xm is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems so i think i can call it a beta release which can be used to develop applications for any noncritical purposes commoninteract may be called a pre alpha release its development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications  platforms this release was compiled and tested on   hp0000000 running hpux 000   sun sparc running sunos release 000   pcat000 running linux v000pl0  caution although the whole stuff was initially developed using an att standard c compiler  this release is tested only with gnu g 000 or above the next release will be tested with both

  bernwardmoepidoopende bernward averwald writes  yes dont confuse the mouse cursor with the text cursor in the xterms the latter is only controlled by the application back in the days of x000 i did analyse the xterm code the cursor  was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character i doesnt seem to be changed til now but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via xtappaddtimeout or similar   xtappaddtimeout doesnt work in xterm because despite appearances  to the contrary xterm is not really an xt based application  other sources like timeouts and inputs are never checked in xterms main loop so dont be surprised when you try this and it doesnt work    kaleb

  dplelungtainforescom david levine writes  hey folks im attempting to use imake to manage makefiles for a development effort and was curious to find out if anybody else is experiencing problems with any target that has subdirs generated by imake on solaris 0 platforms   for example make makefiles chokes in the very first subdirectory   ie target subdirmakefiles not found   you dont give the precise error message but i assume that the making of the target fails because make cant find the rules  weve seen this happen with sunos 0x make as well and aat this point im not sure why it happens it seems to happen with large makefiles the entries near the end get lost small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem as it does in your example  in the mit r0 distribution  r0sunos0patch this can happen with the target makefiles in one of the doc directories  at first i thought this was a bug with make on my sun but i built and used gnumake with the same results attached youll find the first makefiles target rule from the generated makefile  this is really weird are your really sure that you were using gnu make  casper

  as quoted from 0000may000000000000moepidoopende by bernwardmoepidoopende bernward averwald   back in the days of x000 i did analyse the xterm code the cursor   was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character i doesnt  seem to be changed til now  but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via  xtappaddtimeout or similar   the server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous though see also desqviewx which does this in its dos windows  do you really want xterm to wake up every half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt  brandon  
   after looking at the scaling code i realized the follwing    0 my problem with the resolution 000x000 foints is due to an installation       problem    0 that the x server or font server will rescale the best font it can find      to meet your requirements         this means that if you server return a response like the following       adobehelveticamediumonormal000000p0iso00000       you can ask for the follwogin          adobehelveticamediumonormal000000000p0iso00000        and it will generate it for you  you should try to always use       known pixel sizes    bill jones     
  thanks to everyone who mailed help unfortunately the end problem was a really stupid oversight on my behalf the code was 000 perfect but it might help to add controlc to my makefile  anyway the mangled name was telling me it couldnt locate the control constructor  i just want to reaffirm what a valuable book this one is im enjoying evry page   
      im posting this request again since the last one had no title     im looking for x server software on dos or windows     ive already seen desqviewx and xvision but would like to be aware  of other solutions namely public domain or shareware implementations     id also like to know in the commercial case about possible problems  incompatibilities available window managers and libraries etc     if you have any experiences in this area please let me know      c u     bye       mario valente      try linux available on the internet

   i understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets                         callbacks and actions  the problem i face now is that i have a quite long piece of application code that performs a lot of drawing into a window i want to connect this to a widget no problem so far i could use a callback function or an action to do this processing any events afterwards  but because the drawing takes some while i want the application code sequence to be able to be interrupted by events then i want to handle the events and resume with processing the application code at the point it was interrupted it seems to me that this isnt possible but how can i give the user the impression that his inputs are immediately processed   has anybody an idea  please answer via email  thanks in advance  soenke   soenke voss                                                faculty of economics soenkewiwi00unibielefeldde                          university of bielefeld                                                              w0000 bielefeld 0                                                                         germany  the only difference between me and a madman is that i am not mad  salvador dali

  excerpts from netnewscompwindowsx 00may00 re colors and x windows a john cwiklamorrisonwri 0000    the problem is that we need solutions for applications now  and although   i would love to have most of the things mentioned here somebody has to write   it   what id like to see is this scenario   each widget view whatever describes its colors via a palette  palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information  they are not directly tied to the object that uses them  palettes are held in the server  a palette can accomadate up to the number of hardware color cells of color descriptors   when the input focus is in a particular widget that widget has access to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette  all other widgets transiently get the closest approximation that can be generated by a union of the colors from the current palette and any free colors that are left over   a widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index pixel into its associated palette   the bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server

      i understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets                           callbacks and actions    the problem i face now is that i have a quite long piece of application code  that performs a lot of drawing into a window i want to connect this to a  widget no problem so far i could use a callback function or an action to do this processing any events afterwards    but because the drawing takes some while i want the application code sequence  to be able to be interrupted by events then i want to handle the events  and resume with processing the application code at the point it was  interrupted  it seems to me that this isnt possible but how can i give the user the  impression that his inputs are immediately processed    use a workproc  see xtappaddworkproc0xt  you should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks this is the hard part  then in the callback that starts the drawing you call xtappaddworkproc to call your workproc the first time  your workproc should be a function that returns a boolean true when you are finished and false when you want to keep processing  if you return false the workproc is automatically reinstalled    note that this method is better that using a timeout loop since events get processed in a more precedenceoriented manner  if you are using the same ada bindings i am however you are hosed and should look into xtappaddtimeout0xt   joe hildebrand hildjjfuentezcom software engineer fuentez systems concepts 0000000000  standard disclaimers apply

  hi netters  we have a problem with makedepend it doesnt know how to correctly process if clause in c preprocessor statements it evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are for example makedepend chokes on one of x00 include files as distributed by sun  namely xosh  if     definedsunos00  definedstdc        include stringh        define  index   strchr        define  rindex  strrchr else    bsd  stdc         include stringsh endif   sunos00  stdc   here makedepend evaluates both if and corresponding else statements to true and tries to open the file stringsh which doesnt exist under solaris0 we also have a lot of if statements in some of our legacy code we got and built makedepend off the net  it didnt fix the problem  in all fairness it should be noted that makdepend manpage suns distribution mentions this problem  bugs      if you do not have  the  source  for  cpp  the  berkeley  c      preprocessor then makedepend will be compiled in such a way      that all if directives will evaluate to  true  regardless      of  their  actual  value  this may cause the wrong include      directives to be evaluated  makedepend should  simply  have      its own parser written for if expressions  has anybody come up with some solutionfix to makdepend other than writeyourownparser and willing to share it with us  since we often experience delays in our newsfeed  please reply  directly to my email address  ill post a summary  thanks in advance       michael turok                                                         information resources inc        email  mltbluesinforescom           000 fifth avenue                voice  000 000 0000 ext0000       waltham ma 00000 usa             fax    000 000 0000

  i have an application that wants to walk the server window hierarchy looking for a window with a specific property   i think what happens is that xquerytree gives me an array of n children but by the time i get to the nth child window it has been destroyed  then i get a badwindow error and my application exits  how can i make this robust  ive thought of the following   0      set up an x error handler that longjmps back to where i         made the offending call  is this safe  do i have to         longjmp or can i just return  badwindow is an x protocol error  if you write a custom error handler which does not do exit0 the error handler will return and let your program carry on  so using a xseterrorhandler is the way to go but never mind the longjmp   0      register for destroynotify on all the windows returned from         xquerytree    too hard

   help  ive got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across the top a toolbar  i wanted to add eventhandlers to these pushbuttons on enterwindowmask and leavewindowmask so that i can put up some descriptive text about the function of each pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it  ive done this fine but ive turned up the following problem  when the pushbuttons are sensitive i get callbacks on both of the above events but when they are not sensitive i only get callbacks on leavewindow events  this seems odd  i would expect this to be an allornothing type of thing  is this a bug  if not can someone explain this behavior  thanks  mark
