directory on the wuarchive  they are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions dmorfxexe and dtaxexe you can also find a version of aaplayexe there with which you can view files you create with dtaexe or dtaxexe  i downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing  away the afternoons since  the programmes are all a bit buggy and definitely notreadytospreadtothemasses but they are very well written   the interface is frustrating at first but it gets easy once you figure out the tricks  i have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph without using the splines option  not sure why since i dont have the source  i think it was written for tp 00  if anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing  to work right tell me it took me several hours the first time just to figure out that if i just used the durned splines then  it would work  jna jna0000usledu  ryan rapcisufledu    hello      i am looking to add voice input

documentation about nextstep version of renderman available i can create very complicated scenes and render them using surface shaders  but i can not bring them to life by applying shadows and reflections  as far as i understand i have to define environmental and shadows maps to produce reflections and shadows but i do not know how to use them  any advises or simple rib or c examples will

chould do only zero or full intensity for each primary i dont think youd get great equivalent 00bit photographs  i have not suggested to do so i wrote about problems and the problem were clearly visible with 0 bit bw images not to mention 00 bit images   description of experiment deleted   if the 0 bit images are viewed quickly and in sync with screen then 000 intensities could be better than we have  i dunno   more deleted   in any case getting black color with slow machines is problem i could try it on our 0 bit screens but i dont know how to render pixels with x in constant time i recall our double buffer has other image color and one bw  that doesnt help either maybe i should dump photos to screen with low level code how  a few years ago a friend and i took some 000 greylevel photos from a 0 bit mac plus screen using this method displaying all 000 levels synchronized to the 00hz display took about 00 seconds after experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well giving respectable contrast the quality of the images was pretty good there were no visible contrast bands  to minimize the exposure time the display program built 000 different 0 bit frames the first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 000 the second only for pixels that had value 000 etc these frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to or onto the screen in sequence creating these frames sometimes took 000 minutes on that old mac but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway and yes we wrote directly to the screen memory mea culpa  our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center it took an extra week to have the film developed and printed because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print whod have guessed  regards jon rowlands    a few years ago a friend and i took some 000 greylevel photos from a 0 bit mac plus screen using this method displaying all 000 levels synchronized to the 00hz display took about 00 seconds  why didnt you create 0 greylevel images and display them for 0000000000000 time slices  this requires the same total exposure time and the same precision in timing but drastically reduces the imagepreparation time no         kenneth

programs of the ppmtools to print hardcopies of colored x windows my problem is  i dont like xpr it gives at least the x00r0 version does louzy output the hardcopy looks very grainy to me instead i use pnmtops this takes full advantage postscript and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a graylevel image to black and white dots  so if you have a postscript printer try xwdtopnm xwdfile  convert to ppm ppmtopgm   to graylevel for smaller file to print pnmtops noturn   to postscript lpr print  pnmtops has several neat options but use them with care if you want your image to be 0 wide use pnmtops noturn scale 000 width 0 noturn prevents the image from being rotated if it is wider than it is high width 0 specifies the paper width not the image width  see below scale 000 is used because if the image is small it may fit within a width less than 0 and will thus be printed smaller than 0 wide if you first scale it up a lot it will certainly not fit in 0 and will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified paper width  in short pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size but it will not blow it up automatically  hope this helps marcel    x

kjbmgluvesa00zip  this is a universal vesa driver  it supports most video boardschipsets include the speedstar00 and 00x up to 00 bit color  terry  ps  ive tried it on a speedstar00 and 00x and it works   not with all software  for instance it doesnt work at all with animator pro from autodesk it cant detect any svga modes when  running univesa this is really a problem as we need a vesa driver for both aa pro and some hicolor stuff   just out of curiosity are you using the latest version 00  versions previous to this did not fill in all of the capabilities bits and other information correctly  i had problems with a lot of software until i got this version  i dont think the author got around to posting an  announcementof it or at least i missed it but 00 was available in the  directory indicated as of 000  i sure did use version 00 it works fine with most software but not with animator pro and that one is quite important to me pretty useless program without that thing working imho so i hope the author can fix that  daniel            daniel falk             dont quote me no comments                                              ebenezum the great wizard

you could share the info with me  this is for a project i am contemplating of doing  thanks in advance  please reply via email if possible  hbj   some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same direction  ie on a closed cube all normals point outwards  you can use the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal by making sure that all points are either in clockwise or counterclockwise order  how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a  set of points edges and faces   say that you had a cube with all faces that  have their normals facing outwards except for one face  whats the best way to realize that face is flipped and should have its points reordered   i thought i had a good way of telling this but then realized that the algorithm i had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise order for a 0d polygon  id like something for 0d data  any hints tips references would be appreciated  steve

the ati ultra plus 0mb cant do plus the ati costs 000us street price      how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a  set of points edges and faces   look for edge inconsistencies  consider two vertices p and q which are connected by at least one edge  if pq is an edge then qp should not appear    if both pq and qp appear as edges then the surface flips when you travel across that edge  this is bad    assuming warningwarningwarning that you have an otherwise acceptable surface  you can pick an edge any edge and traverse the surface enforcing consistency with that edge        0 pick an edge pq and mark it as ok     0 for each face f containing this edge if more than 0 oops        make sure that all edges in f are consistent ie the face        should be pqqrrssttp  flip those which        are wrong mark all of the edges in f as ok        and add them to a queue check for duplicates and especially        inconsistencies  dont let the queue have both pq and qp      0 remove an edge from the queue and go to 0  if a marked edge is discovered to be inconsistent then you lose  if step 0 finds more than one face sharing a particular edge then you lose       otherwise when done all of the edges will be consistent  which means that all of the surface normals will either point in or out  deciding which way is out is left as an exercise      kenneth

points edges and faces  this algorithm works well for me  algorithm to attempt to find outwardfacing normals  first mark all faces as unknown  then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices  pick an arbitrary face and mark it counterclockwise  using the edge dictionary orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face  and recurse for all surrounding faces consistently orienting the entire surface  find the average of the vertices in this surface  using that point calculate a volume measurement taking into account the faces orientation  if the volume turns out to be positive assume the faces are oriented correctly  if it is negative reverse their orientations mark them clockwise  if any faces are still unknown after this choose another face and go through the algorithm again  at the end faces marked clockwise must have their indices reversed

information on stereoscopic imaging on a sun workstation  for the most part i need to know if there is any hardware available to interface the system and whether the refresh rates are sufficient to produce quality image representations  any information about the subject would be greatly appreciated      thanks     one thing  a small change in initial conditions can cause a huge  change in final conditions  there are certain things about the way  the plate tektoniks and volcanic activity effect a land scape that  is while not entirely random unpredictable  this is also true with  fractals so one could also conclude that you could model this  fractally   yeah and its also true most long complicated sequences of events calculations or big computer programs in general  i dont argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals i just question whether you should  the fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we cant model should be replaced with a random number generator  that has been useful for instance in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system but i dont think it has much to do with fractals and i certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner  i guess i just havent seen all these earthshaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists  i really hope i do but im not holding my selfsimilar breath   there is one other thing that fractals are good for  fractal  image compression  uh huh  ill believe it when i see it  ive been chasing fractal compression for a few years and i still dont believe in it  if its so great how come we dont see it competing with jpeg  cause it cant ill wager  actually i have wagered i quit trying to make fractal compression work and i was trying because i dont think its a reasonable alternative to other techniques  it is neat though   ill reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal  thats why i dont think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical  i know barnsley and sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work but i dont see anyone using it in a real product  its been six years since iterated systems was formed right  there are always going to be questions until theres a product out there sloan replies  the

drawing in the new colours  use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g  b values in the range from 000 for most cards for a particular palette colour in the range from 0000 for 000 colour modes  then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and the result should be ok  you might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have more than 000 unique rgb triplets for a 000

technical information   the player is a rather straightforward implementation of the mpeg spec 0 the idct is based on the chenwang 00 multiplication algorithm 0 not quite the optimum i know blocks with not more than eight nonzero coefficients use a nonseparated direct multiplyaccumulate 0didct sounds great doesnt it which turned out to be faster than a fast algorithm in this quite common case dithering is pretty standard main difference to the berkeley decoder except for the fewer number of supported algorithms is the use of 000 instead of 000 colors the default option to use a restricted colorspace and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither this leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image i claim judge yourself  restricted colorspace means that the u and v components are clipped to 000 instead of 00 and the display colorspace points are distributed over this restricted space since the distance between colorspace points is thus reduced by a factor of two the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors  saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color lying somewhere between the points of the display color space is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation this yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes the same reasoning as used by the pal tv standard to improve on ntsc the improvement is particularly visible

even if a lot slower  i would like to go back to  using povray directly under dos anyone any ideas  john                    john heaton      nrs central administrator       mcc network unit the

information posted some years ago on this very problem  note the early use of postscript technology predating many of this years papers listed in the april 0st siggraph program announcement posted here a few days ago   eric   intersection between a line and a polygon undecidable by dave baraff tom duff  from debcharismagraphicscornelledu newsgroups compgraphics keywords p np jordan curve separation ursyhon metrization theorem organization program of computer graphics     i need to find a formulaalgorithm to determine if a line intersects   a polygon  i would prefer a method that would do this in as little   time as possible  i need this for use in a forward raytracing   program  i think that this is a very difficult problem  to start with lines and polygons are semialgebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points  here are a few offthecuff ideas  first we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated  now the jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open and thus noncompact regions  thus the line lies completely inside the polygon the line lies completely outside the polygon or possibly but this will rarely happen the line intersects the polyon  now the phrasing of this question says if a line intersects a polygon so this is a decision problem  one possibility the decision model approach is to reduce the question to some other well known problem q and then try to solve q  an answer to q gives an answer to the original decision problem  in recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called postscript  see postscript language by adobe systems incorporated isbn  0000000000 co 0000  so given a line l and a polygon p we can write a postscript program that draws the line l and the polygon p and then outputs the answer  by output we mean the program executes a command called showpage which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon  a quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q and thus the original problem  there are two small problems with this approach   0 there is an infinite number of ways to encode l and p into the reduced problem q  so we will be forced to invoke the axiom of choice or equivalently zorns lemma  but the use of the axiom of choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days  0 more importantly the question arises as to whether or not the postscript program q will actually output a piece of paper or in other words will it halt  now postscript is expressive enough to encode everything that a turing machine might do thus the halting problem for postscript is undecidable  it is quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable   i wont even begin to go into other difficulties such as aliasing finite precision and running out of ink paper or both  a couple of references might be  0 principia mathematica  newton i

delivered since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 0 milliseconds with scattergather     well sure its no worse than npcomplete but thats only if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a lipschitz condition on its second derivative  i think theres an 00 siggraph paper from caltech that deals with this     j o n a s   y n g v e s s o n          email jonasyisyliuse

a   polygon does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing  information on the subject     regards    simon  basically there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside outside or on the polygon the first one is ray or half line method in this method you can draw any ray if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even then it is outside if the number is odd then it is inside of cause you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache  the second method is pi algorithm draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines if the result is 0pi then it is inside if pi then it is on the polygon otherwise it is outside  my experience tells the second method is relible  hope this helps  yeh usc   bob davis sonnytrantorharrisatdcom wrote  in article c0tkgm0v0unixportalcom wilshellportalcom ville v walveranta writes              is there any

reality our agency started to express interest in  virtual realityvr  so far we do not know much about vr  all we  know about are the hollywood movies the terminater 0 and lawnmover  man  we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and  computer graphics world magazine   unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects for both terminator 0 and lawnmower man those are filmquality computer graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time  each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on highend parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time 00 frames per second      we certainly want to know more about vr  who are the leading  companies  agencies universities  what machines support vr ie sgi sun0  hp0000 bim0000 etc   it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 00 to 00 newly rendered frames per second  this is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous  thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations  additionally the frame rate must be constant  if the system renders 00 frames per second at one point then 00 frames per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in realtime  unix in general does not support realtime operation but silicon graphics has modified the unix kernel for its multiprocessor systems to be able to support realtime operation bypassing the usual unix process prioritymanagement schemes  uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support realtime operation not sun sparc00 not hp 000 series systems not ibm rs0000 not even sgis uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support realtime operation due to their symmetric multiprocessing smp sharedmemory architecture  from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and realtime multisample antialiasing  of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine0 systems fully support these capabilities the antialiasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment

is a multiuser nonimmersive xwindows based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainmentresearch  features     clientserver based model using berkeley sockets    no limit to the number of users apart from performance    generic clients    customizable servers    hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources    multiple light sources ambient point and spot    objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily         attached  functionality    client    the client is built around a fast render loop basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the users    viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the users    actions  which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users     the client is designed to be generic  in other words you dont need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it the adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers     this release of the client software supports the following functionality      o hierarchical objects with associated addressing      o multiple light sources and types ambient point and spot      o user interface panels      o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rates      o mouse and keyboard input     some people may be disappointed that this software doesnt support the    powerglove as an input device  this is not because it cant but because    i dont have one this will however be one of the first enhancements    servers    this is where customization can take place the following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers      o transparent client management      o client message handling     this may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them  the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally     things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects      o server selectable extension installation         what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world basically you call the extension         initialisers you want      o event handler registration         when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to         current events supported init move change collide  terminate      o collision detection registration         if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software         your callback will be activated when a collision occurs      this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose      the following is all you need to make a world server application      o provide an initworld function         this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus         any initialization you want to do      o provide a positionobject function         this is where you determine where to place a new client      o provide an installworldobjects function         this is where you load the world wld file for a new client      o provide a getworldtype function         this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have      o provide an animateworld function         this is where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the objects         move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit         to avoid outrunning the clients      thats all there is to it and to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers ive provided          generic  00 lines         dactyl  000 lines more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs will probably be improved with future                            versions         dogfight  00 lines  location     this software is located at the following site    ftpuwashingtonedu     directory    pubvirtualworlds     file    multiverse000tarz  futures     client      o texture mapping      o more realistic rendering ie zbuffering or similar gouraud shading      o hmd support      o etc etc     server      o physical modelling gravity friction etc      o enhanced object managementinteraction      o etc etc     both      o improved comms  i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and im not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified   i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe  ive certainly found fascinating developing it and i would love to add support for the powergloveand an hmd   finally one major disclaimer  this is totally amateur code by that i mean there is no support for this code other than what i out the kindness of my

is made by impulse and is in its    welli dont know about its competing with 0d studio but  its pretty powerful allright  yes but a key issue is speed how fast is imagine and is it as easy to use as 0d studio can it just do a render as fast as 0ds if you dont want things like ior etc 0ds can do fine shadows animated reflection maps animated bump maps animated anything maps and with the ipas routines  not that ive ever seen them it can do explosions top quality morphing fire rain lens flares etc im not knocking imagine i just want to know how it compares with 0ds   hi all ive just recently become seriously hooked on pov but there are a few thing that i want to do that pov wont do penumbral shadows dispersion etc i was just wondering what other sharewarefreeware raytracers are

cylinder in 0d defined as a line segment between two points and  a radius eg sxsysz to exeyez and r what is the easiest and not  too expensive way to find if a ray defined as another line through two  points cuts through this cylinder and if so where    i think the test for touching is rather simple if the closest approach  of the two lines is less than r then the ray does penetrate the cylinder  nope this wont work for a cylinder you can have a line arbitrarily close to the the cylinder backbone and yet not intersect it the test works for a pillbox though a cylinder with two hemispheres attached at the ends   thanks  ryan koehlersecsucscedu  arun     c lee leeobiwanrsghaccom wrote   did you say dec alpha  upgrade path from    0xx0 replace  upgrade path from vax 00x0 to alpha replace

better architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones and 0 that dec did  no  thats not what i was complaining about nor did i intend to suggest that dec was any better than sgi let me tell you about the lynx some day but be prepared with a large sedative if you do  my comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi  what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck  im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while rather than being flushed  now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter but im just a little tired of getting boned in the process  maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa for instance are  this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond  that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other vendor  im going to be looking at this box for the next five years and every time i look at it im going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money since were supported almost entirely by federal tax

i promise the docs now contain a chapter for c programmers on how to use the grafsys if you have problems feel free  to contact me the other change is that i removed the fastperftrig calls from the fpu version to make it run faster  those of you who dont know what all this is about read on    programmers 0d grafsys  what it is   didnt you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of  drawing threedimensional scenes   didnt you always want to write this program that visualized the structure  of threedimensional molecules  and didnt the task of writing your 0d conversions routines keep you from  actually doing it  well if the answer to any of the above questions is yes but what has it to  do with this package  read on  grafsys is a think pascalc library that provides you with simple routines  for building saving loading as resources and manipulating  independent rotating around arbitrary achses translating and scaling  three dimensional objects objects not just simple singleline drawings  grafsys supports full 0d clipping animation and some primitive hidden linehiddensurface drawing with simple commands from within your program  grafsys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections if you cant understand a word dont worry this is just showing off for those who know about it the docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on   grafsys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use grafsys to do the 0d transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing note that grafsys also provides drawing routines so you dont have to worry about that if you dont want to  grafsys 000 comes in two versions one for the 000 and 000 or above  processors the other version uses fixedpoint arithmetic and runs on any mac both versions are 000 source compatibel   grafsys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 0d graphics and how to use the package  if demand is big enough i will convert the grafsys to an objectclass library  however i feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people

some help with it  we bought this thing because it 0 has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and 0 claimed to print 000 gray level images  however the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 0 and 0 bitpixel images  after some initial problems with the parallel interface i now have this thing running from a parallel port of an hewlettpackard workstation and i can print 0 and 0 bitpixel images just fine  i called the mitsubishi people and asked about the 000 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs  this was not mentioned in the sales literature  however they did say the p00u can do 0 bitpixel 00 level images in parallel mode but they didnt have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call japan etc  frankly i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 0 bitpixel images from the video source it cant store 0 bitspixel in the memory  its

ram from the flock    my  comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other  vendors  that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi  opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive 0d graphics applications it is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor  sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable     what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that  we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the  crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck  if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team feel free to contact the local branch managerwe understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot     im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a  previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around  for a while rather than being flushed  as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in 0000 and grew to include the 0d00 0d00 0d00 and 0d00 as clock rates sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about 00 years this was true of the motorolabased 0000 series 0000 the pi 0000 the professional series the early 0ds  0000 the power series parallel systems 0000 individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 0 years new graphics architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every 00 months to 0 years  these are the facts of life  if we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and io and larger disk capacities if we dont we become uncompetitive  from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today  you cant wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep for one in writing if its feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the performance protection program for older r0000based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r0000based 00bit multiprocessor systems     now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to  keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself  pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books  just before the end of the quarter but im just a little tired of  getting boned in the process    if thats happening its becausing of misunderstandings or miscommunication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base   maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we  arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa  for instance are  this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs  and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers  every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis  most sgi customers are onesytwosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we preannounced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments   the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the  entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that  means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i  have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one  previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other  vendor  im going to be looking at this box for the next five years  and every time i look at it im going to think about sgi and how i  could have better spent my money actually your money since were  supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars    five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor technologies are arriving every 00 years making a 0 year old computer at least 0 and probably 0 generations behind the times the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really 0 years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor  there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so dont give up we know it  josh                joshua mogal     product manager advanced graphics division     advanced graphics systems

whether anyone had managed to compile this software  the quick answer is yes the long answer is yes  but a few have had a few problems with their platforms  not all unixs are the same you know as far as many bugs go it would probably be more useful to everyone including you if you were a bit more explicit   platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are rs0000 dec ultrix sun solaris so it is possible  the main problem is that i dont have access to other platforms than the rs0000 so if there are portability problems then the only way i hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it  as far as the software not doing anything do you really think i would bother releasing it if that was the case perhaps you didnt read the few docs that are supplied the dogfight world is made up of clients only so if youre in there on your own then youre not going to see anything the dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary  so if you dont see anything there then this is definitely a problem  one final word  if youre not interested dont bother with it if you are interested then please remember that im not asking for any money so why not try a little patience and constructive criticism maybe that will get results  robert robertacsccom    i dont think speed has been determined since it has never run on intel chips but on the amigas motorola chips it was one of the fastest true ray tracers  i dont think impulse would port it over and not take speed into consideration  in terms of features and learning curve all that you stated for 0ds is also true for imagine and lots more but ill have to admit that after 0 years of use on the amiga the learning curve is very steep this is due only to the manual it is realy bad however there is a lot of after market support for this product including regular tips articles in many magazines such as avid and a great book by steve worley called understanding imagine 00 this book i is not just recommened it is a must  i think an important consideration should be price 0000 for 0ds not including tool packages under 000 for imagine complete    sketch  rotate so cylinder axis is  z axis  intersect xy projection of line with projected cylinder similar to but easier than sphere intersection  result no intersection one intersection or two intersections parameterized along line by t0 and t0  now look

posts about people still awaiting delivery are making me a little paranoid  has anyone actually  held this piece of software in their own hands  later  jim nobles    hi there  ive made a vga mode 00h graphics library available via ftp  i originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself but perhaps someone here will find them useful  they are certainly useable as they are but are missing some higherlevel functionality  theyre intended more as an intro to mode 00h programming a starting point   the library assumes a 000 processor but it is trivial to modify it  for a 000  if enough people ask ill make the mods and repost it as a  different version  the routines are written in assembly tasm and are callable from c  they are fairly simple but ive found them to be very fast for my purposes anyway  routines are included to enter and exit mode 00h define a virtual screen put and get pixels put a pixmap rectangular image with no transparent spots put a sprite image with seethru areas copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory etc  ive also included a simple c routine to draw a line as well as a c routine to load a 000 color gif image into a buffer  i also wrote a quickndirtytm demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three windows  the whole package is available on spangcamosunbcca in pubdosvglzip  it is zipped with pkzip 000g  it is completely in the public domain as far as im concerned  do with it whatever you like  however itd be nice to get credit where its due and maybe an email telling me you like it if you dont like it dont bother  mark morleycamosunbcca   i searched the u mich archives fairly thoroughly for 0d graphics packages i always thought it to be a mirror of sumexaimstanfordedu i was wrong ill look into grafsys it does sound interesting  thanks cheinan  bobc     sorry about not mentioning platform my original post was to macprogrammer and then decided to post here to compgraphics  id like the 0d software to run on primarily mac in either c object pascal think or mpw but ill port to windows later so a package that runs on mac and has a windows version would be ideal  im looking for a package that has low

solution    its not a bad question i dont have any refs that list this algorithm either but thinking about it a bit it shouldnt be too hard  0 take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on you say you have this algorithm already  0 find the center  of this circle the line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere  0 repeat with the unused point and two of the original points this gives you two different lines that both pass through the spheres origin their interection is the center of the sphere  0 the radius is easy to compute its just the distance from the center to any of the original points  ill leave the math to you but this is a workable algorithm    an alternate method would be to take pairs of points the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere three pairs will form three planes intersecting at a point this might be easier to implement  steve spworleynetcomcom   im a mac user who wants to use some of the rayshade models ive built using macrayshade rayshadem with stratavision

000x000 by 000 colors since it only requires 000000 bytes  my 0000a vesa tsr supports this its the only vesa mode by card can support  due to 0000a restrictions a wdparadise      i am not responsible for anything i do or say  im just an opinion               robert jc kyanko robrjckuucp    ahh no  possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your  calculator  000 color modes take a byte per pixel so 000 time 000 is  000000 which is 000k to be exact  000x000x000 only takes 000k but i  dont think it is a bios mode  i wouldnt bet that all vga cards can do  that either  if a vga card has 000k i bet it can do both 000x000 and  000x000  that by definition is svga though not very high svga    yes i did punch in the wrong numbers working too many late nites  i intended on stating 000x000 is 000000 bytes  its not in the bios just my vesa tsr   i am not responsible for anything i do or say  im just an opinion              robert jc kyanko robrjckuucp   a very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in cview since he isnt in the position to post this himself he asked me to post it for him but to leave his name out so here it comes  cview has quite a number of bugs  the one you mention is perhaps the most annoying but not the most dangerous  as far as i can determine it has to do with the temp files that cview creates  cview gives the user no control over where it places its temp files it just places them in its current directory  the problem you mention occurs as far as i can tell when it runs out of disk space for its temp files it seems as if cview doesnt check properly for this situation  as cview decodes a jpeg it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 00 bit colour information then for 0 bit displays it does the dithering again writing another file with the 0 bit colour information  while it is writing this second file it also writes the data to your colour card then when it does the last chunk of 0 bit data it recopies all the data from the 0 bit file to your screen again  it does this last recopy operation for its fit to screen feature even when this feature is not enabled   the result of this process is the following         0 if it runs out of disk space when writing the first 00 bit file all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because cview never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writesreads arent performed       0 if it has enough room for the 00 bit data but runs out of room for         the 0 bit data you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card         however then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 0 bit file to screen for whatever reason it does this         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk  this is just a guess but probably fairly accurate  at least the general idea is on track i think although i have probably made errors in details about file io etc  the way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space  the temp files for large jpegs 0000x000 and bigger can be very large 0 meg  0 meg   on some of the largest i have needed in excess of 0 meg free disk space   cview has a much more serious bug if you are trying to display a file from a floppy and you change floppies while cview has some temp file open on the floppy then cview in certain circumstances will write the directory and fat table i cant remember for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious possibly unrevcoverable way  so be careful  it is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this  on the other hand when choosing files in the open files menu cview insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hilighter square  incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info  and really how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing   with much thanks to the originator of this article            rene walter

far as  i know  its a   simple  raytracer  used in the  visualization  of  synchrotron   beam  lines now we have  an  old  version of the  program here but unfortunately we dont have any documentation if anyone knows  where i  can  get  some  docs or maybe  a  newer  version  of  the program or  even  another  program that does the same sort of  thing i would love to hear from you  ps i think shadow was written by a f cerrina  anyone any ideas  thanks gary serc daresbury lab     is there any program available free or otherwise for taking a tiff or gif or some other bitmapped file and turning it or parts of it into ascii characters    dos os0 or platform independent programs if possible    thanks   we need a good concave convex polygon conversion routine ive tried a couple without much luck  please email responses and i will post a summary of any replies  thank you  richard stoakley rws0vuvacscsvirginiaedu   hi  im hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science project group we are doing computer science honours and our project is to do a graphical simulator for a finite state automata  basically the program must draw a diagram of a fsa from a textual grammar showing circles for states and labeled arcs inbetween  the problem is working out the best way to layout the states and draw the arcs inbetween so that as few arcs as possible cross each other  if anyone has any suggestionsalgorithmsbugfree ready to compile c code   that might help us it would be much appreciated  thanks in advance  gregory   hi to all out there  we have this problem and im not certain im solving it in the correct way  i was wondering if anyone can shed light on this or point me in the right place to look  we have an xray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole passing through it at a right angle to the tubes axis                                                                                                                      image

on the image of the hole on the screen  however the calculations are mathematically highly complex and must assume that the objects hole projects an image resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen in the centre of the screen  however it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently    firstly we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse  i cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is  do i have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation  how do i do this transformation  secondly there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar the sourcescreen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen  how can i compensate the ellipses axis for this image distortion  so please can anyone give us a few pointers here  how do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen and how do i deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen  wed appreciate

embarassing if it is trivial or an faq  given 0 points non coplanar how does one find the sphere that is center and radius exactly fitting those points  i know how to do it for a circle from 0 points but do not immediately see a  straightforward way to do it in 0d  i have checked some geometry books graphics gems and farin but am still at a loss please have mercy on me and provide the solution    wouldnt this require a hypersphere  in 0space 0 points over specifies a sphere as far as i can see  unless that is you can prove that a point exists in 0space that is equidistant from the 0 points and this may not necessarily happen  correct me if im wrong which i quite possibly am  steve  sorry   call the four points a b c and d any three of them must be noncollinear otherwise all three could not lie on the surface of a sphere and all four must not be coplaner otherwise either they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them  a b and c define a circle the perpendicular bisectors of ab bc and ca  meet in a point p say which is the centre of this circle this circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere  consider the normal to the plane abc passing through p all points on this normal are equidistant from a b and c and its circle in fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere take the plane containing this normal and d if d lies on the normal any plane containing the normal will do this plane is at right angles to the abc one  let e be the point there are normally two of them on the circumference of the abc circle which lies in this plane we need a point q on the normal such that eq  dq but the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ed and the normal is such a point and it exists since d is not in the plane abc and so ed is not at right angles to the normal   algorithm  is the sphere well defined     0 check that a and b are not coincident  failure     0 find the line ab and check that c does not lie on it  failure     0 find the plane abc and check that d does not lie in it  failure yes find its centre     0 find the perpendicular bisectors of ab and ac     0 find their point of intersection p     0 find the normal to the plane abc passing through p line n     0 find the plane containing n and d find the point e on the abc circle in this plane if d lies on n take e as a     0 find the perpendicular bisector of ed line

will be very close to p relative to the radius of the abc circle and subject to error its best to choose d so that the least of ad bd and cd is larger than for any other choice   bob douglas

program to convert dxf files to a database format used by a 0d graphics program ive written  my program stores the points of a polygon in ccw order  ive used 0d concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn  does the dxf format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in cw or ccw  its easy enough to convert but if i dont know which way they are stored i dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from  if dxf doesnt handle this can anyone recommend a workaround the best i can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the dxf file one stored cw and the other ccw  but that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed  thanks in advance for any help  patrice hugohydraunmedu    we have been using iterated

00k  windows have granularities so you cant just anchor  them anywhere  also some implementations allow two windows   0 my interest is in 000x000x000 mode  should this mode be called     svga mode  what is the technique for fast image scrolling for the     above mode  how to deal with different svga cards  this is vesa mode 000h  there is a set display start function that might be useful for scrolling     your guidance to books or any other sources to the above questions  would be greatly appreciated  please send me mail  your best bet is to write vesa for the info  there have also been announcements on this group of vesa software    karl schultz                             schultzvnetibmcom these statements or opinions are not necessarily those of ibm   rgc0000bcsteccaboeingcom robert g carpenter writes   hi netters    im building a cad package and need a 0d graphics library that can handle  some rudimentry tasks such as hidden line removal shading animation etc    can you please offer some recommendations  its really not that hard to do  there are books out there which explain everything and the basic 0d functions translation rotation shading and hidden line removal are pretty easy  i wrote a program in a few weeks witht he help of a book and would be happy to give you my source also quickdraw has a lot of 0d functions built in and think pascal can access them

should be fast  libertarian atheist semianarchal technorat  i define myselftsacellarorg   what are the main advantages of this method  i have seen it described and the algiorithm seems a  little bit long  i developed my own method which requires that the points be in a counterclockwise order and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn method  it uses few calculations however basically it is several comparisons  the only disadvantage i see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand  my method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise  when looking at the back of something the points occur in an opposite direction from the front so merely by figuring out which way the points go you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 0d polygon

say but i have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the centris youll see why please noflames i reserve those for csma       i was in chicago in the last consumer electronics show and apple had a booth there  i walked by and they were showing realtime video capture using a radious or supermac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies  i think the quicktime they were using was the old one 00     they digitized a guy talking there in 000x0xx something  it played back quite nicely and in real time  the guy then expanded the window resized to 00x by 0xx 000 in y i think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasnt 00fps or about 00fps anymore  it dropped to like 00 fps  then he increased it just a bit more and it dropped to 0000 fps      then i asked him what mac he was using he was using a quadra dont know what model 000 to do it and he was telling the guys there that the quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an lcii     well i spoiled his claim so to say since a 00000 quadra mac was having a little bit of trouble  and this wasnt even from the hardisk  this was from memory     could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assisted centris or another software product running the  animation like supposedly macrominds accelerator     dont misunderstand me i just want to clarify this     but for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not i can claim 000x000 a tad more with overscan being done in 000000 colors in  my computer not from the hardisk at 00fps

smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon then you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon  there are two ways to do this  use a somewhat tricky but bynow well examined lineartime algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull routine and accept on log n  both methods are discussed in preparata and

working   for alex goetz  you might try contacting them if you already have idl   or would be willing to buy it  its a few thousand dollars american i   expect for idl and the other should be free  those are the general   purpose packages ive heard of besides what terramar has   sips was written for aviris imagery  im not sure how general purpose   it is  you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask  i   have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification you can compute an image using selected components  ive   used it on 00 megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best   speed you need an external dsp card  it will work without it but large   images take quite a while 0000 times as long to process  thats a   freebie if you want it    my  favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems   inc  idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its   programming language is very strong and easy  very pascallike it   handles the numbercrunching very well also personally i like doing   the numbercrunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even   excel on the mac if its not too hairy then bringing it over to nih   image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldnt handle and the speed and ease of use   compared to iraf was incredible by the way its mostly astronomical   image processing which ive been doing this means image enhancement   cleaning up bad linespixels and some other traditional image   processing routines then for example taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line i choose with the mouse then doing a curve   fit to that line which i might do like in kaleidagraph    for idl call research systems  for pvwave call precision visuals and  for sips call university of colorado  boulder  from what i can  understand you can get packaged

applications   host configuration requirements    it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun   though there  were rumors there are always rumors that the software   would be  ported to pc and possibly a sun environment  pci    a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes   an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i   forget  the software is available in versions for msdos unix   workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly   other platforms by now  i use the vms version    the pci software consists of several classesgroupspackages of   utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci   database disk file  the tape io package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape   formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file   this is the only package i use or know much about  other packages can   display data from the pci database to one or another of several   pcisupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer eg an epsontype   dotmatrix graphics printer  you might be more spe cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and   fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg   multiply channel 0 by 0 add channel 0 and store as channel 0 and   god only knows what all else  theres a lot  i dont have and dont   use these so cant say much about them you only buy the packages your   particular applicationinterest calls for    each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from   a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default   directory  some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations  the standard pci environment contains a   scripting language very similar to ibmpc basic but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  in vms i can also   invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure  theres   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the pci   data structures database file parameter file    the pci software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but   requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the   level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well  for instance the tape io package offers a   utility for reading headerless multiband what adobe photoshop on the   macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different   interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphicarts industrys ct0t format would probably i havent tried   handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what   youre doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start   over  its worth noting that the pci database file is designed to   contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of   other information i observe that a remotesensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude   longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this   can go into the pci database    i believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  on vax   systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific   thirdparty display systems the name goulddeanza seems to come to   mind  one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vctq qbus   00bit directcolor display subsystem  pci software could be overkill   in your case it seems designed for the very high end   applicationsusers ie those for whom a macpc largely doesnt suffice   although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  its   probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which   does a lot of its landresource management via remote sensing i believe   the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these   areas  spam spectral analysis manager    back in 0000 jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis   manager which got a fair amount of use at the time  that was designed   for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data  000 pixels   across by  000 lines by  000 bands a modified version has since   been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging   spectrometer which uses much larger images    spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and   ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays   actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   stretching  spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering    the original spam uses x or sunview to display  the aviris version may   require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame   buffer  i can refer you to people if youre interested  pcw requires x   for display  map ii    among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley  clrview    clrview is a

writes most info regarding dangers of reading from floppy disks omitted unrevcoverable way  so be careful  it is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this nevertheless it is an important bug that needs to be squashed  i am merely pointing out that it was probably overlooked  while it is serious one must keep in mind that it will probably affect at most 0 of the targeted users of cview  ok i dont use cview anymore but i saw that no one had explaind this bug in the thread so here goes  it is not the fault of cview  it is dos  if you leave a file open on a floppy drive then change the disk and do something which updates or closes that file you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and fat from the other disk written to the new disk  this has always been true and has destroyed data under other programs not just cview  the only thing cview can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave files open unless its actively using them ie reading and decoding

realtime video capture using a radious or supermac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies  i think the quicktime they were using was the old one 00     they digitized a guy talking there in 000x0xx something  it played back quite nicely and in real time  the guy then expanded the window resized to 00x by 0xx 000 in y i think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasnt 00fps or about 00fps anymore  it dropped to like 00 fps  then he increased it just a bit more and it dropped to 0000 fps      then i asked him what mac he was using he was using a quadra dont know what model 000 to do it and he was telling the guys there that the quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an lcii     well i spoiled his claim so to say since a 00000 quadra mac was having a little bit of trouble  and this wasnt even from the hardisk  this was from memory     could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assisted centris or another software product running the  animation like supposedly macrominds accelerator     dont misunderstand me i just want to clarify this    the 0do box is based on an arm risc processor one or two custom graphics chips a dsp a doublespeed cdrom and 0mb of ramvram im a little fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and ramvram capacity  it was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the

000x000  compactvideo is pretty amazing i also wanted to point out that quicktime does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated above im sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine i have a q000 and do this quite a bit the price of generality personally i dont use the dynamic sizing of movies often if ever but playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest 000 machines  im not sure how a centris00mhz 000 stacks up against the 00 mhz arm in the 0do box obviously the arm is faster but how much

address to reply to      0  what is jpeg  jpeg pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 0bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   0  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 00bitperpixel color data instead of 0bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 0 mbyte fullcolor file down to 000 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 00 bitspixel 00 million colors instead of 0 or less 000 or fewer colors  if you have only 0bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 0bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 0 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   0  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 00bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 0 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 00 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 000 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 0 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 00 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   0  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 000x000 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 0b  file   size in bytescomments  shipppm0000000  original file in ppm format no compression 00 bits  or 0 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead shipppmz 000000  ppm file passed through unix compress  compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note  other textoriented compressors give similar results shipgif 000000  converted to gif with ppmquant fs 000  ppmtogif  most of the savings is the result of losing color  info gif saves 0 bitspixel not 00  see sec 0  shipjpg00 000000  cjpeg q 00    highest useful quality setting  this is indistinguishable from the 00bit original  at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00    default setting  you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this  from the original even with both onscreen at once shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  this has slight defects if you know what to look  for you could tell its been jpeged without seeing  the original  still as good image quality as many  recent postings in usenet pictures groups shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  jpegs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent  at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some  still ive seen plenty of usenet postings that were  of poorer image quality than this shipjpg0o   0000  cjpeg q 0 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead  blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or  indexing purposes  note that this file is tiny  the compression ratio from the original is 0000   in this case jpeg can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 00 file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   0  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 00 does not mean keep 00 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 00 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 00 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 00 saying q 000 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 00 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 00 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 00 is about right for compressing 00bit images but q 00 to 00 is usually better for converting gifs see section 00 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 0 to 00 is about right  q 0 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 0b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   0  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   0a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  john bradleys free xv version 000 and up is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu or ftpcisupennedu  the file is called xvtarz where  is the version number currently 000 it is located in the contrib directory on export or the pubxv directory at upenn  xv reduces all images to 0 bits internally which means its not a real good choice if you have a 00bit display youll still get only 0bit color  also you shouldnt use xv to convert fullcolor images to jpeg because theyll get colorquantized first but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other 0bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in versions 000 and earlier be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 00bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 000  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage000tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v0 decoder while xloadimage 000 is using a hackedover v0  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli000tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 00bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os0 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 00a is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 000000000 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg00azip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 000 or 000000 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 00 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv00zip  hiview requires a 000 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm000 and 000max work windows and os0 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 00  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview00zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv0zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel00 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 000a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 00  available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw000azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic00 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg0zip or jpeg0000zip if you have a 000 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 0b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif0jpgjpg0gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 00bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 00 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif0jpg0zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy  this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats  it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 000 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsalch000zip  note about simtel00 the internets key archive site for pcrelated programs is simtel00 full name wsmrsimtel00armymil 0000000000  simtel00 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel00 that really means pd0msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel00  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel00 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 00000000000 which keeps simtel00 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel00 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel00 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 00 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 00 and 000ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version 00 is available from ftpcicaindianaedu 000000000 file pubpcwin0desktopjview000zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchivewustledu  winjpeg shareware 00 displays jpeggiftargatiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and slideshow  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows0winjp000zip  this is a slow 000compatible version if you register youll get the 000only version which is roughly 00 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 00  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 000 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin0desktopcview000zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos  dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in fullscreen mode not in a window  os0  the following files are

huge amounts of ram otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs  strong 00bit display support  shareware 00  macintosh  most mac jpeg programs rely on apples jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a 00000 or better cpu and you need to be running system 000 or later  if youre running system 0 you must also install the 00bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 0  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 0000 this file contains quicktime 00 which is better than qt 00 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 00  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 00 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 00 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 000000 file infomacappjpegview00hqx  requires system 0 and quicktime  on 0bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 000x000 pixels on a typical 0mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 00 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 000  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter000hqx  requires system 000 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert00hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v00 a jpeggif converter based on an old version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt00stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 00bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 0 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 00bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress000hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 00bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 000 or later can read and write jfifformat jpeg files use the jpeg plugin from the acquire menu  you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it  amiga  most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amigaphysikunizhch 000000000  there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one  in

color quantization  most people dont have fullcolor 00 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 0 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 000 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 0bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 000orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 000 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 000color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 000 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 000 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 000color gif on a 00color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan0bit display hardware already 00bit hicolor pc displays true 00bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   0  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart00  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   0  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 000 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v0 free jpeg code you can also say sample 0x0 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 00bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 0 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 0 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   00  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 00 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 00 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 0a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 00 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif0jpgjpg0gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   00  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  0  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d0 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 00 followed by jfif  0  if you see ff d0 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  0  hsi files start with hsi0  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  0  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d0 and you should be able to read it  0  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d0     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  begin line mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  begin line mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   00  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 0 or 00 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   00  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 00 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    00  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 0 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 000 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 00 or 00rd the size of the gif file not 00th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 00 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 00 to 00 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 000 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v0 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 00 or so when converting gifs values of 00 to 00 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 00 smooth 00 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the

 the intersection of 0 planes method looks best but my implementation based on a short article in  graphics gems i doesnt work  i may be misinterpreting of course  i had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products but the former may actually be better  in either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed implicitly in the solution of linear equations  to get the planes i was taking the midpoint of the line from say p0 to p0 and setting the normal as the normalized vector from p0 to p0 these just plugged into the formula in graphics gems  however the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 0 of my test points for different tests  my matrixvector math is very rusty but it looks like i need to verify the formula or use the simultaneous equation solution which will require bringing in another routine i dont have but should be easy to find  another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 0 sets of 0 points and intersecting the normals from there  this would also define the circle center  however small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect  supposedly 0 planes have to

bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me  four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of

determining which plane the 0 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite r when intersecting the two lines there are 0 possibilities they are the same line  the 0 points were on a planar circle they are different lines but parallel there is a sphere of in radius  this last case can be achieved with 0 colinier points and any 0th point by taking the 0th point and pairs of the first 0 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  if all 0 points are coplanar but are not on one circle   it seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 0 points are coplanar the algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar 0 points being colinear  coplanar  testing if the 0th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 0 points has been found is trivial   an alternate method would be to take pairs of points the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere three pairs will form three planes intersecting at a point this might be easier to implement  steve spworleynetcomcom   look in the pubspace directory on amesarcnasagov  there are a number of earth images there you may

programming for a program to do this  on the other hand when choosing files in the open files menu cview insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hilighter square  incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info  and really how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing  in all fairness how many people do you know personally who read images from floppy drives  i havent tried it with jpegs but i do realize how agonizingly slow it is with gif files    nevertheless it is an important bug that needs to be squashed  i am merely pointing out that it was probably overlooked  while it is serious one must keep in mind that it will probably affect at most 0 of the targeted users of cview    renewbladestackurctuenl rene

miniwar by what i am going to say but i have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the centris youll see why please noflames i reserve those for csma       i was in chicago in the last consumer electronics show and apple had a booth there  i walked by and they were showing realtime video capture using a radious or supermac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies  i think the quicktime they were using was the old one 00  version 00 of quicktime is as has been stated the current version of the software the older version is 00 and 00 is on the horizon in the not too distant future     they digitized a guy talking there in 000x0xx something  it played back quite nicely and in real time  the guy then expanded the window resized to 00x by 0xx 000 in y i think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasnt 00fps or about 00fps anymore  it dropped to like 00 fps  then he increased it just a bit more and it dropped to 0000 fps   quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it does playing back resized movies apparently the process of expanding each frames image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate bit depth is pretty processorintensive there are optimizers that work pretty well for showing movies at double size but if you drop to 00x size or increase to 00x size performance suffers dramatically     then i asked him what mac he was using he was using a quadra dont know what model 000 to do it and he was telling the guys there that the quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an lcii  he lied  quicktime is very cpu dependent he was probably confused by the fact that qt is locked to an internal timecode and will play in the same amount of time on any machine however an lc will drop frames in order to keep the sound and video synced up  the centris and quadras have similar cpus and will thus boast similar performance though the quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture     well i spoiled his claim so to say since a 00000 quadra mac was having a little bit of trouble  and this wasnt even from the hardisk  this was from memory     could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assisted centris or another software product running the  animation like supposedly macrominds accelerator  i expect that the version of the quicktime software you saw was 00  i was using was 00 one of the new codecs in v00 allows video at nearly twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 00 could handle the centris 000 i saw was a plainvanilla with the exception of the nice speakers that were playing the sound and the software was movie player the qt player apple includes with the software     dont misunderstand me i just want to clarify this  no problem  it still surprises me that quicktime is able to do the things it does as well as it can  sean mcmains

in your room  dm     lets say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything  on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true xy positions are known    now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danons excellent digitize program  that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to xy and saves those values when you click the mouse  upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values  this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you  the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretchingcontracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory  so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion  in particular if i have three sets of points   referencexy the known true values  distortedreferencexy the same points with known errors  distorteddataxy other points with unknown errors  what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors  i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy 0d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points  any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas or better yet pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems  thanks  earl     hi  could anyone tell me

artists designers scientists engineers and educators share the     problem of moving information from one mind to another     traditionally they have used pictures words demonstrations     music and dance to communicate imagery  however expressing     complex notions such as god and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills      the explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem  in hypermedia multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant  wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions a confounded user asks what does it all mean      since image construction transmission reception decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks strongly influenced by     physiology education and culture and since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step then we as electronic     communicators must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding      therefore the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines including but not limited to the     physical biological and computational sciences technology art     psychology philosophy and

class of distortion  below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions feel free to poke me via email   assume locally smooth distortion  0 compute the delaunay triangulation of your xy points  this    defines the set of neighbors for each point  if your data are    not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull    consider deleting these edges  0 now there are two goals      a move the distorteddataxy to the referencexy     b keep the lengthe as measured from the current xys        as close as possible to the digitizedlengthe as measured         using the digitized xys  0 for every point compute a displacement based on a and b  for    example      a for xy points for which you know the referencexy you        can move alpha0referencexy  currentxy   this will        slowly move the distortedreferencexy towards the        referencexy      b for all other points examine the current length of each edge        for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength         take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the        point alpha0sumofedgedisplacements  this will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh  0 iterate 0 until you are happy for example no point moves very much  alpha0 and alpha0 need to be determined by experimentation   consider how much you believe the referencexy  ie do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges  warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially you cant allow the convex hull to change and you cant allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles  both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically retriangulating the points using  the current positions  but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions  when we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once  if i were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 0 years i might go back and retriangulate on every iteration  if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other pointbut first read up on linear solutions to the nbody problem  there are lots of papers in the last 00 years of

  about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult  i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published  solutions to it  the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines  for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional ie only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space  to draw  the object we   0 fit a cubic spline through the points  each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve  each spline has an equal number of segments  we assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure 0 take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline  use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface 0 depth sort the triangles 0 take each triangle in sorted order project onto a 0d pixmap draw and color the triangle  take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color  it is the edge coloring in step 0 that is at the heart of the problem  the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface  the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines  if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area  thanks    does anybody have an algorithm for flattening out a globe or any other parametric surface that is definied parametrically  that is i would like to take a sheet of paper and a knife and to be able to calculate how i must cut in the paper so i can fold it to a globe or any other object         marco seirio  in real life sp0marsecaligulahisse         in

used by televisions  while there is equipment that will do the conversion it is hard to get your hands on and costs quite a bit  if you have access to an amiga computer that has an ntsc output you can transfer certain types of graphic files by modem and tape them from the ntsc output  unfortunately this would be framebyframe and would lead to unbelievably scratchy animation unless you had a good amiga animation program  otherwise see if your local public access cable station has equipment that you can use     concerning the proposed newsgroup split i personally am not in favor of  doing this

because no one has touched the problem i posted last week i guess my question was not so clear now id like to describe it in detail  the offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse in other words the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere  this problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used the tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the balls center is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse the answer is no ironically dmis  an american indutrial standard says it is ellipse so almost all the software which was implemented on the base of dmis was wrong the software was also sold internationaly imagine how many people have or will suffer from this bug how many qualified parts with ellipse werewill be discarded and most importantly how many defective parts with ellipse arewill be used  i was employed as a consultant by a company in los angeles last year to specially solve this problem i spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming now my solution nonlinear is not ideal because i can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset it is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method i used is not analytical i am now wondering if i didnt touch the base and make things complicated please give me a hint  i know you may argue this is not a cg problem you are right it is not however so many people involved in the problem sphere from 0 poits why not an ellipse and why not its offset  please post here and let the others share our interests  i got several emails from our netters they said they need the summary of the answers  yeh usc     concerning

find out how to use the quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the mac so should be fast  just to clarify the 0d routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray not the rom of the mac  a few years ago before i knew anything about implementing graphics i came across a demo of the apple grafsys0d library and it actually did a lot  however it is quite limited in the sense that its a lowlevel 0d library your code still has to plot individual points draw each line etc ad nauseum  it has nothing on gl for example where you can handle objects   thanks for the clarification before posting my original request i had looked  into the macs 0d capabilities and dismissed them as low grade  bobc    in article

complicated and nearly infinitely easier to write than to read which i think hurts your acceptance by anything that will need to read those images eg paint programs  in a nutshell i dont think tiff is salvageable unless the fat is trimmed significantly and then it wouldnt be tiff anymore  they keep trying to cut it back but its late now  maybe they will fix it and change that magic number to

digital film system based on the mac quadra that does nonlinear full digital editing  if youre considering such a system here are the pros and cons  for the educational environment this system is excellent  we use it to produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local network  because this programming is going to be viewed on other macs the image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the video to the net  we also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for use by the lewis  clark community  since these programs are not meant for commercial or broadcast use image quality is not critical  the digital film system for those of you who are uninitiated is an ab roll digitizing system on one 0000 jpeg compression card  it was promoted as an inexpensive online editing system with svhs quality  supermac the maker of the card is trying to achieve this quality level but as yet has been unable to deliver  our system produces near vhs quality at 00 fields per second 000x000 overscan  the card repeats every other field to get 00 fields per second  this results in a kind of super 0 film look that some find distracting  if you can get past this problem youll find the adobe premier editing  software quite enjoyable with which to work  it produces thousands of different effects from crystalize filters to dve transitions to color matting  because of its nonlinear nature editing is fast and easy  if youve ever used or seen used an avid or montage system youll recognize the methodology and the user

 please note the newsgroups  recent discussion about xvs problems were held in some newsgroup here is some text users of xv might find interesting i have added more to text to this collection article so read on even you so my articles a while ago  i hope author of xv corrects those problems as best he can so fine program xv is that it is worth of improving i have also minor ideas for 00bit xv email me for them  any misundertanding of mine is understandable   juhana kouhia   clip   deleted  note that xv saves only 0bitrasterized images that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpegtogiftojpeg quality also theres three kind of 0bit quantizers your final image quality depends on them too   this were the situation when i read jpeg faq a while ago   imho it is design error of xv there should not be such confusing errors in programs theres two errors   xv allows the saving of 0bitrasterized image as jpeg even the    original is 00bit  saving 0bitrasterized image instead of    original 00bit should be a special case   xv allows saving the 0bitrasterized image made with any quantizer     the main case should be that xv quantizes the image with the    best quantizer available before saving the image to a file lousier    quantizers should be just for viewing purposes and a special cases    in saving the image if at all   clip  clip   deleted  it is limit of xv but not limit of design it is error in design it is error that 0bitquantizedrasterized images are stored as jpegs jpeg is not designed to that  as matter of fact im sure when xv were designed 00bit displays were known it is not bad error to program a program for 0bit images only at that time but when 00bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 00bit images that were not done and now we have  the program violate jpeg design and any 00bit image format  the program has human interface errors  otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 00bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use   deleted   clip  some new items follows  clip  i have seen that xv quantizes the image sometimes poorly with best00 option than with default option we have the reason surely is the quantizer used as best00 it is surprise the same than used in ppmquant  if you remember i have tested some quantizers in that test i found that rlequant with default is best then comes djpeg fbmquant xv our default in that order in my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly  it actually gave image with bad artifacts  i dont know is ppmquant improved any but i expect no so use of xvs best00 option is not very good idea  i suggest that author of xv changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant  im sure rlepeople gives permission another could be one used in imagemagick i have not tested it so i can say nothing about it  clip  clip  some minor bugs in human interface are  key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer often it happens that i make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place it is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately the buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete  also good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for xv after the image is completed often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly just when im writing something with editor or such those key pressings then go to xv and image has gone or something weird  in the color editor when i turn a color meter and release it xv updates the images it is impossible to change all rgb values first and then get the updated image it is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready

am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that  we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the  crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck  it should have been made fairly clear that the most crimson would ever get was a 000 00 old style mhz cpu upgrade  certainly this was mentioned on compsyssgi on more than one occasion as being likely  if our sales folks were saying otherwise they were either confused or less than honestethical or somebody further up the chain inside sgi was misleading them   im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a  previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around  for a while rather than being flushed  there were 0 versions 00 00 00 00 although admittedly the 00 came out at the same time as the 00 over a period of 0 00 years  the chassis simply couldnt be pushed any further  id say 0 years was a pretty good lifespan myself for a system design in this day and age  getting the 00 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups we would have been out of our minds to push it further and i know that was made clear almost from the day the 00 started shipping  we had one last kicker in the form of the elan graphics which made 0 graphics versions over its lifespan which i also think is pretty good   now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to  keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself  pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books  just before the end of the quarter but im just a little tired of  getting boned in the process  please by all means send a complaint letter through sgi support or sales on your concerns  there should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers sure sometimes there will be confusion for a while over whether an upgrade will be available but that shouldnt last too long and doesnt seem to be what you are referring to  yes the sales folks do get bonuss at the end of some all quarters but that is pretty common industry wide and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that arent what they need im sure but nobody is forcing you to buy at end of quarter after all   maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we  arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa  for instance are  this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs  they dont get all that long a lead time either although certainly they get presentations on possible new products and their opinions may well influence the end product but that also is life in the industry  we cant design systems that meet just their needs or we wont sell too many systems after all which is not to say that we dont have some niche products like reality engine   and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers  every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis  the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the  entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond  that  means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i  have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one  previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other  vendor  im going to be looking at this box for the next five years  and every time i look at it im going to think about sgi and how i  could have better spent my money actually your money since were  supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars  but surely you dont expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period  thats a rather unreasonable expectation in my experience with workstationsmicrocomputers  supported and parts available yes but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest   now youll have to pardon me while i go off and hiss and fume in a  corner somewhere and think dark libelous thoughts  i missed your first posting but as i say by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside sgi where it might have an effect not immediate im sure but complaints arent going to be ignored and may affect future plans if we  hear similar things from more than one personsite  all of the above is

           grenoble   does anyone know of software that will allow you to convert coreldraw cdr files containing bitmaps to scodal as this is the only format our bureaus filmrecorder recognises  jeff lyall  i used this combination for a while  a qcrz recorder i think  and as far as i remember corel can export in scodal scd format  just select export on the main file menu  this may not be implemented in earlier versions of course in which case youre on your own  also i seem to think that the sw for the qcrz at the time did strange and very undesirable things if any part of the pic was outside the screen area on corel  i once spent an afternoon painfully discovering that one pixel had somehow strayed offscreen causing my whole slide to be blank  the qcrz also couldnt handle gradfill over gradfill  so if you use a graduated colour background if you then gradfill an object on top of this the fill appears on the final slide as a circle i think and totally ignores the shape of the object being filled  of course if the recorder isnt a qcr you can ignore all this and feel suitably   cheers toby                                           toby freeman

original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny     and distribution  digital immortality  the basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around nearforever  the gifs and jpgs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future  perhaps theyll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapesbut theyll be thereand someone will dig them up     if that doesnt interest you otis also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your worksa virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors  suddenly life is  breathed into your workand by merit of its stimulus it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons   spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts  keep your own copies of the images to look at when youve got the gumption thats what theyre here for    where               otis currently as of 00000 has two ftp sites      0000000000 projectsotis the uwi site  sunsiteuncedu pubmultimediapicturesotis the sunsite  you can also gopher to this site for otis as well  merely anonymous ftp to either site on internet and change to the appropriate directory  dont forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure youre in binary  otis has also been spreading to some dialup bbs systems around north americathe following systems have a substancial

lovely    photo get it scanned into an image file then either ftpput it in the contribincoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me email addresses at eof in email  after the image is received it will be put into the correct directory  computer originated works are also welcome  otis directories house two types of image files gif and jpg   gif and jpg files require oddly enough a gif or jpg viewer to  see  these viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large ftp sites around internet  jpg viewers are a bit tougher to find  if you cant find one but do have a gif viewer   you can obtain a jpgtogif conversion program which will change     jpg files to a standard gif format   otis also accepts animation files        when you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people to view  also include some biographical information on yourself well be having infofiles on each contributing artist and their works  you  can also just upload a textfile of info about yourself instead of  emailing  if you have pictures but no scanner there is hope  merely send copies to  the otis project co ed stastny po bx 000000 omaha ne 000000000  i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them  include an ample sase if you want your stuff back   also include information on each image preferably a 00 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where its finally put  if you have preferences as to what the images are to be named include those as well     conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and well arrange things  if you want to submit your works by disk peachy  merely send a 00 disk to the above address omaha and a sase if you want your disk back this is good for people who dont have direct access to encoders or ftp but do have access to a scanner  we accept disks in either mac or ibm compatible format  if possible please submit image files as gif or jpg  if you cantwe can convert from most formatswed just rather not have to  at senders request we can also fill disks with as much otis as they can stand  even if you dont have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an sase or 000 for disk postage and packing to  get a slabootis  as of 000000 were at about 00 megabytes of files and growing   email me for current archive size and directory    distribution  the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another  in fact we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such  if you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images     it would also be nice if youd send me a note when you did post images from otis to your local bbs  i just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is  its the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as possible  if you have the time please upload a few to your favorite bbs systemor even just post this infofile there  it would be keen of you    use  if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory youll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit  you will either find this in the rm file for     the image or series of imagesor in the artists directory under the  artists name  if permission isnt explicitly given then youll have  to contact the artist to ask for it  if no info is available email me edcwisunomahaedu and ill get in contact with the artist for  you or give you their contact information   when you do use permitted work its always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files    naming images  please keep the names of your files in dos format  that means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less  the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number thus leonardo devincis fifth mechanical drawing would be something like   ldmek0gif     or    ldmek0jpg    or    ldmech0gif   etc  keeping the names under 0 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems        creating image files  when creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture  this gives people a reference in case theyd like to contact you  you may also want to include a title address or other information youd like people to know    hmmm  thats about it for now  more guidelines will be added as needed your input is

for windows  when i exit from it it says my current driver can handle on 00000 colors when i am actually in  0000x000x00000 color mode  is this a driver problem a gws error or what  i am using the 0000 driver under win 00  it correctly states that i can display 00m colors when i switch to 000x000x00bit though another question anybody know of any viewers that support this card other than windows viewers any help would be appreciated      i am looking for comments from people who have usedheard about photoshop for windows is it good how does it compare to the mac version is there a lot of bugs i heard the windows version needs finetuning  any comments would be greatly appreciated  thank you  andre boisvert beaverrotqcca  an review of both the mac and windows versions in either pc week or

clc 000 color laser copier psipu unit postscript intelligent processing unit   hello  we have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copierprinter  we want to be able to print to it from our sgi iris network  the  copierprinter has both a parallel and scsi interface  i have configured the printer with the lp system using the parallel interface and can print  postscript files to the printer  i can also print rgb files but these are in  turn converted to postscript by an internal filter  the canon clc 000 is a  publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts  are less than acceptable  we create the postscript files with a variaty of  programs such as showcase xv and tops  when we convert to postscript  with tops and use the l option to specify the halftone screen density of 00  rather than the default 00 the output is better but still much less that  acceptable  note that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript  we suspect that if we could use the scsi interface we would get higher quality  pictures  we have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the  scsi port  to my knowledge this software is 0000 and does not come with a  warranty  the management here does not want to spend this much money without  some assurance that the product will work   here my questions  if anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the scsi or  parallel port  what is the quality of the printouts  is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts  what is the limiting component the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on  the printer   the big question  where can i get some software to drive the scsi port for this printer    please

writes  why not use the pd c library for readingwriting tiff files it took me a  good 00 minutes to start using them in your own app  i certainly do use it whenever i have to do tiff and it usually works very well  thats not my point  im philosophically opposed to it because of its complexity  this complexity has led to some programs poor tiff writers making some very bizarre files other programs inability to load tiff images though theyll save them of course and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand tiff  as the saying goes its not me im worried about its all the other  assholes out there  ive had big trouble with misuse and abuse of tiff over the years and i chalk it all up to the immense and unnecessary complexity of the format  in the words of the tiff 00 spec appendix g page g0 capitalized emphasis mine  the only problem with this sort of success is that tiff was designed to be powerful and flexible at the expense of simplicity  it takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification probably no application does a complete job and that is currently the only way you can be sure that you will be able to import any tiff image since there are so many imagegenerating applications out there now   if a program or worse all applications cant read every tiff image that means there are some it wont some that i might have to deal with  why would i want my images to be trapped in that format  i dont and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning not that anyone does of course   ab    hello  hello       i was wondering if anyone knew of a pc or mac implementation of the marching cubes algorithm that will output the individual

you in advance     for some reason i never saw the original post on this thread but if you are looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a pc you really cant go past the mode x stuff from dr dobbs this code is all pdomain as far as i know and in the original articles the routines were all presented as dumb vga routines and then optimised to modex with some interesting discussion along the way if you are interested i could find out more details of the issues in question i have them at home  bernard   in 0000000bvma0o0diablouucp diablouucpcboesel charles boesel writes   in article

but you definitly compromise speed  it seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes with some great software but im not so sure about the excelerator part  i used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster than that  one thing i do like is that it loads its own vesa driver from rom at startup i think because i have never had to load it for links000 or any other programs that

system  it was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques      intuitive graphic interface  sphinx features an interactive interface with popup menus and  pointandclick dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast this accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations      image format compatibility  using smart readwrite functions sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit integer or real data values  sphinx also reads and writes the common tiff and gif formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space      image analysis  processing  for image and pixel analysis the sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations such as fourier transforms convolution  product or principal component analyses an interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively standard fortran notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions      satellite spectra  orbit analysis  sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites eg goes meteosat noaa spot etc the simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands a geometry model computes the solar zenith angles warping orbit simulation and 0d image projection      easy external program interfacing  sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations  sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions      quick quality presentation  sphinx rapidly displays manipulates and enhances highresolution multispectral images and color tables  using six 0bit 0000x0000 image planes and one graphics plane the package conveniently combines color images graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports sphinxs 0d and 0d graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images such as  histograms and radial graphs  the package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers other capabilities sphinx also performs image animation external  graphics importing mosaic fitting what else      software support  development   sphinx was developed at the laboratoire doptique atmospherique loa  of the universite de lille france the package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the french national laboratory centre national de recherche scientifique cnrs and the french space agency centre national detudes spatiales cnes at loa sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology  the package which features online help is supported by an internet address

still have to do the knight horse any ideas i am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces the board is marble unfortunately black wont work very well for the one side anybody with ideas for nice surfaces  i would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield command unfortunately the manual is very vague about this and i dont have craig kolbs email address anybody with ideas because this is essential for my next venture into raytracing  where should i post the finished chessboard  is there anybody else using rayshade on nonunix systems  how fast does unix render

  some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same direction  ie on a closed cube all normals point outwards  you can use the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal by making sure that all points are either in clockwise or counterclockwise order  how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a  set of points edges and faces   say that you had a cube with all faces that  have their normals facing outwards except for one face  whats the best way to realize that face is flipped and should have its points reordered   i thought i had a good way of telling this but then realized that the algorithm i had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise order for a 0d polygon  id like something for 0d data  any hints tips references would be appreciated  steve   where humor is concerned there are no standards  no one can say what is good  or bad although you can be sure that everyone will   john kenneth galbraith  these opinions are my own

   how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a  set of points edges and faces   look for edge inconsistencies  consider two vertices p and q which are connected by at least one edge  if pq is an edge then qp should not appear    if both pq and qp appear as edges then the surface flips when you travel across that edge  this is bad    assuming warningwarningwarning that you have an otherwise acceptable surface  you can pick an edge any edge and traverse the surface enforcing consistency with that edge        0 pick an edge pq and mark it as ok     0 for each face f containing this edge if more than 0 oops        make sure that all edges in f are consistent ie the face        should be pqqrrssttp  flip those which        are wrong mark all of the edges in f as ok        and add them to a queue check for duplicates and especially        inconsistencies  dont let the queue have both pq and qp      0 remove an edge from the queue and go to 0  if a marked edge is discovered to be inconsistent then you lose  if step 0 finds more than one face sharing a particular edge then you lose       otherwise when done all of the edges will be consistent  which means that all of the surface normals will either point in or out  deciding which way is out is left as an exercise      kenneth sloan                   computer and information sciences sloancisuabedu               university of alabama at birmingham 000 0000000                  000a campbell hall uab station  000 0000000 fax              birmingham al 000000000

   one thing  a small change in initial conditions can cause a huge  change in final conditions  there are certain things about the way  the plate tektoniks and volcanic activity effect a land scape that  is while not entirely random unpredictable  this is also true with  fractals so one could also conclude that you could model this  fractally   yeah and its also true most long complicated sequences of events calculations or big computer programs in general  i dont argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals i just question whether you should  the fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we cant model should be replaced with a random number generator  that has been useful for instance in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system but i dont think it has much to do with fractals and i certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner  i guess i just havent seen all these earthshaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists  i really hope i do but im not holding my selfsimilar breath   there is one other thing that fractals are good for  fractal  image compression  uh huh  ill believe it when i see it  ive been chasing fractal compression for a few years and i still dont believe in it  if its so great how come we dont see it competing with jpeg  cause it cant ill wager  actually i have wagered i quit trying to make fractal compression work and i was trying because i dont think its a reasonable alternative to other techniques  it is neat though   ill reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal  thats why i dont think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical  i know barnsley and sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work but i dont see anyone using it in a real product  its been six years since iterated systems was formed right  there are always going to be questions until theres a product out there sloan replies  the company plans to ship its first encoding devices in the summer he says  in march iterated systems will have the other half of the system the decoders   scientific american march 0000 page 00  allen b dont even get me started

   youll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing in the new colours  use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g  b values in the range from 000 for most cards for a particular palette colour in the range from 0000 for 000 colour modes  then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and the result should be ok  you might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have more than 000 unique rgb triplets for a 000 colour mode   geoff thomasgeoffreycosccanterburyacnz computer science dept university of canterbury private bag christchurch oook  new zealand

  hi  i am digitizing a ntsc signal and displaying on a pc video monitor it is known that the display response of tubes is nonlinear and is sometimes said to follow gammalaw i am not certain if these nonlinearities are gammacorrected before encoding ntsc signals or if the tv display is supposed to correct this   also if  000 grey levels for example are coded in a c program do these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a pc monitor in other words does pc monitor display circuitry correct for gamma errrors   your response is much appreciated   amjad  amjad soomro ccs computer science center u of maryland at college park email amjadwamumdedu

   does anybody know what delaunay triangulation is is there any reference to it  is it useful for creating 0d objects if yes whats the advantage  it is used to create a tin triangulated irregular network which is basically a bunch of triangles which form a surface over a group of points  what is special about it is that the triangles formed are the  most equalateral possible  check out proceedings of autocarto n where n is 000  sorry i dont have a specific reference describing the process michael

    i am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a   polygon does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing  information on the subject     regards    simon  basically there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside outside or on the polygon the first one is ray or half line method in this method you can draw any ray if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even then it is outside if the number is odd then it is inside of cause you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache  the second method is pi algorithm draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines if the result is 0pi then it is inside if pi then it is on the polygon otherwise it is outside  my experience tells the second method is relible  hope this helps  yeh usc

  sorry i missed you raymond i was just out in dahlgren last month  im the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics so perhaps i can help a little  rchuinswcwonswcnavymil raymond chui writes  hello the real reality our agency started to express interest in  virtual realityvr  so far we do not know much about vr  all we  know about are the hollywood movies the terminater 0 and lawnmover  man  we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and  computer graphics world magazine   unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects for both terminator 0 and lawnmower man those are filmquality computer graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time  each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on highend parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time 00 frames per second      we certainly want to know more about vr  who are the leading  companies  agencies universities  what machines support vr ie sgi sun0  hp0000 bim0000 etc   it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 00 to 00 newly rendered frames per second  this is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous  thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations  additionally the frame rate must be constant  if the system renders 00 frames per second at one point then 00 frames per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in realtime  unix in general does not support realtime operation but silicon graphics has modified the unix kernel for its multiprocessor systems to be able to support realtime operation bypassing the usual unix process prioritymanagement schemes  uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support realtime operation not sun sparc00 not hp 000 series systems not ibm rs0000 not even sgis uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support realtime operation due to their symmetric multiprocessing smp sharedmemory architecture  from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and realtime multisample antialiasing  of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine0 systems fully support these capabilities the antialiasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment     what kind of graphics languages are used with vr  gl opengl phigs pex gks etc  you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop vr applications but that is starting at a pretty low level there are offthe shelf software packages available to get you going much faster being targeted directly at the vr application developer some of

  hi everyone  i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups  announcing the release of multiverse000  multiverse is a multiuser nonimmersive xwindows based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainmentresearch  features     clientserver based model using berkeley sockets    no limit to the number of users apart from performance    generic clients    customizable servers    hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources    multiple light sources ambient point and spot    objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily         attached  functionality    client    the client is built around a fast render loop basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the users    viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the users    actions  which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users     the client is designed to be generic  in other words you dont need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it the adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers     this release of the client software supports the following functionality      o hierarchical objects with associated addressing      o multiple light sources and types ambient point and spot      o user interface panels      o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rates      o mouse and keyboard input     some people may be disappointed that this software doesnt support the    powerglove as an input device  this is not because it cant but because    i dont have one this will however be one of the first enhancements    servers    this is where customization can take place the following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers      o transparent client management      o client message handling     this may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them  the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally     things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects      o server selectable extension installation         what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world basically you call the extension         initialisers you want      o event handler registration         when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to         current events supported init move change collide  terminate      o collision detection registration         if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software         your callback will be activated when a collision occurs      this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose      the following is all you need to make a world server application      o provide an initworld function         this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus         any initialization you want to do      o provide a positionobject function         this is where you determine where to place a new client      o provide an installworldobjects function         this is where you load the world wld file for a new client      o provide a getworldtype function         this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have      o provide an animateworld function         this is where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the objects         move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit         to avoid outrunning the clients      thats all there is to it and to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers ive provided          generic  00 lines         dactyl  000 lines more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs will probably be improved with future                            versions         dogfight  00 lines  location     this software is located at the following site    ftpuwashingtonedu     directory    pubvirtualworlds     file    multiverse000tarz  futures     client      o texture mapping      o more realistic rendering ie zbuffering or similar gouraud shading      o hmd support      o etc etc     server      o physical modelling gravity friction etc      o enhanced object managementinteraction      o etc etc     both      o improved comms  i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and im not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified   i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe  ive certainly found fascinating developing it and i would love to add support for the powergloveand an hmd   finally one major

  comet wrote      in a previous article trb0ramsstateedu tony r boutwell says    there is a new product for the ibmers out there it is called  imagine and it just started shipping yesterday i can personally attest that it will blow the doors off of 0dstudio  it is made by impulse and is in its    welli dont know about its competing with 0d studio but  its pretty powerful allright  yes but a key issue is speed how fast is imagine and is it as easy to use as 0d studio can it just do a render as fast as 0ds if you dont want things like ior etc 0ds can do fine shadows animated reflection maps animated bump maps animated anything maps and with the ipas routines  not that ive ever seen them it can do explosions top quality morphing fire rain lens flares etc im not knocking imagine i just want to know how it compares with 0ds

   i would be most thrilled if some kind person could help me with the following  given a cylinder in 0d defined as a line segment between two points and  a radius eg sxsysz to exeyez and r what is the easiest and not  too expensive way to find if a ray defined as another line through two  points cuts through this cylinder and if so where    i think the test for touching is rather simple if the closest approach  of the two lines is less than r then the ray does penetrate the cylinder  nope this wont work for a cylinder you can have a line arbitrarily close to the the cylinder backbone and yet not intersect it the test works for a pillbox though a cylinder with two hemispheres attached at the ends   thanks  ryan koehlersecsucscedu  arun

  the original posting complained 0 about sgi coming out with newer and better architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones and 0 that dec did  no  thats not what i was complaining about nor did i intend to suggest that dec was any better than sgi let me tell you about the lynx some day but be prepared with a large sedative if you do  my comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi  what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck  im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while rather than being flushed  now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter but im just a little tired of getting boned in the process  maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa for instance are  this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond  that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other vendor  im going to be looking at this box for the next five years and every time i look at it im going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money since were supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars  now youll have to pardon me while i go off and hiss and fume in a corner somewhere and think dark libelous thoughts  spl   steve lamont sciviguy  000 0000000  splszechuanucsdedu san diego microscopy and imaging resourceuc san diegola jolla ca 000000000 my other car is a car too                   bumper strip seen on i000

  our group recently bought a mitsubishi p00u video printer and i could use some help with it  we bought this thing because it 0 has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and 0 claimed to print 000 gray level images  however the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 0 and 0 bitpixel images  after some initial problems with the parallel interface i now have this thing running from a parallel port of an hewlettpackard workstation and i can print 0 and 0 bitpixel images just fine  i called the mitsubishi people and asked about the 000 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs  this was not mentioned in the sales literature  however they did say the p00u can do 0 bitpixel 00 level images in parallel mode but they didnt have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call japan etc  frankly i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 0 bitpixel images from the video source it cant store 0 bitspixel in the memory  its not like memory is that expensive any more  if anybody has any information on getting 0 bitpixel or even 0 bitpixel images out of this thing i would greatly appreciate your sending it to me  thanks  allan weber signal  image processing institute university of southern california webersipiuscedu

   my  comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other  vendors  that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi  opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive 0d graphics applications it is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor  sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable     what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that  we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the  crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck  if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team feel free to contact the local branch managerwe understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot     im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a  previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around  for a while rather than being flushed  as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in 0000 and grew to include the 0d00 0d00 0d00 and 0d00 as clock rates sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about 00 years this was true of the motorolabased 0000 series 0000 the pi 0000 the professional series the early 0ds  0000 the power series parallel systems 0000 individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 0 years new graphics architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every 00 months to 0 years  these are the facts of life  if we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and io and larger disk capacities if we dont we become uncompetitive  from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today  you cant wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep for one in writing if its feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the performance protection program for older r0000based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r0000based 00bit multiprocessor systems     now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to  keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself  pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books  just before the end of the quarter but im just a little tired of  getting boned in the process    if thats happening its becausing of misunderstandings or miscommunication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base   maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we  arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa  for instance are  this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs  and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers  every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis  most sgi customers are onesytwosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we preannounced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments   the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the  entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that  means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i  have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one  previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other  vendor  im going to be looking at this box for the next five years  and every time i look at it im going to think about sgi and how i  could have better spent my money actually your money since were  supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars    five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor technologies are arriving every 00 years making a 0 year old computer at least 0 and probably 0 generations behind the times the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really 0 years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor  there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so dont give up we know it  josh                joshua mogal     product manager advanced graphics division     advanced graphics systems silicon graphics

  hi steve  as the author of multiverse i feel i had better respond to your mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this software  the quick answer is yes the long answer is yes  but a few have had a few problems with their platforms  not all unixs are the same you know as far as many bugs go it would probably be more useful to everyone including you if you were a bit more explicit   platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are rs0000 dec ultrix sun solaris so it is possible  the main problem is that i dont have access to other platforms than the rs0000 so if there are portability problems then the only way i hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it  as far as the software not doing anything do you really think i would bother releasing it if that was the case perhaps you didnt read the few docs that are supplied the dogfight world is made up of clients only so if youre in there on your own then youre not going to see anything the dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary  so if you dont see anything there then this is definitely a problem  one final word  if youre not interested dont bother with it if you are interested then please remember that im not asking for any money so why not try a little patience and constructive criticism maybe that will get results  robert robertacsccom   
  i dont think speed has been determined since it has never run on intel chips but on the amigas motorola chips it was one of the fastest true ray tracers  i dont think impulse would port it over and not take speed into consideration  in terms of features and learning curve all that you stated for 0ds is also true for imagine and lots more but ill have to admit that after 0 years of use on the amiga the learning curve is very steep this is due only to the manual it is realy bad however there is a lot of after market support for this product including regular tips articles in many magazines such as avid and a great book by steve worley called understanding imagine 00 this book i is not just recommened it is a must  i think an important consideration should be price 0000 for 0ds not including tool packages under 000 for imagine complete

  hi there  ive made a vga mode 00h graphics library available via ftp  i originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself but perhaps someone here will find them useful  they are certainly useable as they are but are missing some higherlevel functionality  theyre intended more as an intro to mode 00h programming a starting point   the library assumes a 000 processor but it is trivial to modify it  for a 000  if enough people ask ill make the mods and repost it as a  different version  the routines are written in assembly tasm and are callable from c  they are fairly simple but ive found them to be very fast for my purposes anyway  routines are included to enter and exit mode 00h define a virtual screen put and get pixels put a pixmap rectangular image with no transparent spots put a sprite image with seethru areas copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory etc  ive also included a simple c routine to draw a line as well as a c routine to load a 000 color gif image into a buffer  i also wrote a quickndirtytm demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three windows  the whole package is available on spangcamosunbcca in pubdosvglzip  it is zipped with pkzip 000g  it is completely in the public domain as far as im concerned  do with it whatever you like  however itd be nice to get credit where its due and maybe an email telling me you like it if you dont like it dont bother  mark morleycamosunbcca

  a very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in cview since he isnt in the position to post this himself he asked me to post it for him but to leave his name out so here it comes  cview has quite a number of bugs  the one you mention is perhaps the most annoying but not the most dangerous  as far as i can determine it has to do with the temp files that cview creates  cview gives the user no control over where it places its temp files it just places them in its current directory  the problem you mention occurs as far as i can tell when it runs out of disk space for its temp files it seems as if cview doesnt check properly for this situation  as cview decodes a jpeg it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 00 bit colour information then for 0 bit displays it does the dithering again writing another file with the 0 bit colour information  while it is writing this second file it also writes the data to your colour card then when it does the last chunk of 0 bit data it recopies all the data from the 0 bit file to your screen again  it does this last recopy operation for its fit to screen feature even when this feature is not enabled   the result of this process is the following         0 if it runs out of disk space when writing the first 00 bit file all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because cview never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writesreads arent performed       0 if it has enough room for the 00 bit data but runs out of room for         the 0 bit data you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card         however then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 0 bit file to screen for whatever reason it does this         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk  this is just a guess but probably fairly accurate  at least the general idea is on track i think although i have probably made errors in details about file io etc  the way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space  the temp files for large jpegs 0000x000 and bigger can be very large 0 meg  0 meg   on some of the largest i have needed in excess of 0 meg free disk space   cview has a much more serious bug if you are trying to display a file from a floppy and you change floppies while cview has some temp file open on the floppy then cview in certain circumstances will write the directory and fat table i cant remember for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious possibly unrevcoverable way  so be careful  it is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this  on the other hand when choosing files in the open files menu cview insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hilighter square  incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info  and really how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing   with much thanks to the originator of this article            rene walter                    renewstackurctuenl                will i drown in tears of sorrow is there hope for tomorrow               will this world ever get better cant we all just live together           i dont wanna live in strife   i just wanna live my life                  i deserve to have a future                                                                                the good girls    future

  hi everyone   i am  looking for  some software  called shadow as  far as  i know  its a   simple  raytracer  used in the  visualization  of  synchrotron   beam  lines now we have  an  old  version of the  program here but unfortunately we dont have any documentation if anyone knows  where i  can  get  some  docs or maybe  a  newer  version  of  the program or  even  another  program that does the same sort of  thing i would love to hear from you  ps i think shadow was written by a f cerrina  anyone any ideas  thanks gary serc daresbury lab

  hi  im hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science project group we are doing computer science honours and our project is to do a graphical simulator for a finite state automata  basically the program must draw a diagram of a fsa from a textual grammar showing circles for states and labeled arcs inbetween  the problem is working out the best way to layout the states and draw the arcs inbetween so that as few arcs as possible cross each other  if anyone has any suggestionsalgorithmsbugfree ready to compile c code   that might help us it would be much appreciated  thanks in advance  gregory  
  hi to all out there  we have this problem and im not certain im solving it in the correct way  i was wondering if anyone can shed light on this or point me in the right place to look  we have an xray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole passing through it at a right angle to the tubes axis                                                                                                                      image                                                              xray source                                          screen                             metallic  tube                                                                                                                                    we know sourcescreen centre distance radius of the tube radius of the hole  we do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen  however the calculations are mathematically highly complex and must assume that the objects hole projects an image resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen in the centre of the screen  however it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently    firstly we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse  i cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is  do i have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation  how do i do this transformation  secondly there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar the sourcescreen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen  how can i compensate the ellipses axis for this image distortion  so please can anyone give us a few pointers here  how do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen and how do i deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen  wed appreciate any help either posted or emailed  thanks in advance simon   simon marshall dept of computer science university of hull hull hu0 0rx uk   football isnt about life and death  its more important than that bill email smarshallcshullacuk   phone 00 000 000000  fax 000000   shankley

   hi  im writing a program to convert dxf files to a database format used by a 0d graphics program ive written  my program stores the points of a polygon in ccw order  ive used 0d concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn  does the dxf format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in cw or ccw  its easy enough to convert but if i dont know which way they are stored i dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from  if dxf doesnt handle this can anyone recommend a workaround the best i can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the dxf file one stored cw and the other ccw  but that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed  thanks in advance for any help  patrice hugohydraunmedu

  what are the main advantages of this method  i have seen it described and the algiorithm seems a  little bit long  i developed my own method which requires that the points be in a counterclockwise order and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn method  it uses few calculations however basically it is several comparisons  the only disadvantage i see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand  my method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise  when looking at the back of something the points occur in an opposite direction from the front so merely by figuring out which way the points go you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 0d polygon  has anyone heard of this method before  it is so simple i doubt i am the first to think of it  libertarian atheist semianarchal technorat  i define myselftsacellarorg

  we need a good concave convex polygon conversion routine ive tried a couple without much luck  please email responses and i will post a summary of any replies  thank you  richard stoakley rws0vuvacscsvirginiaedu  the problem is not precisely defined above but if you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon then you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon  there are two ways to do this  use a somewhat tricky but bynow well examined lineartime algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull routine and accept on log n  both methods are discussed in preparata and shamos for example

hips on their first day    hips features images that are  selfdocumenting   each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image   hips includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of unix   filters  it comes complete with source  code  online manual   pages and online documentation    host configuration requirements    originally  developed at  new  york  university  hips  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available  it runs under the unix operating   system  it is modular  and  flexible provides automatic documentation   of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment   hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and   microvax sun apollo  masscomp  ncr tower iris ibm at etc   for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and   adage ikonas image processors and the sun0 sun0 sun 0 and   sun000i consoles  we also  supply  usercontributed

includes an   interface  for the  crs0000 it  is  a  simple matter to interface hips   with other frame stores and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max   video hips can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 00 of hips is machine independent    availability    hips has proven itself a highly flexible  system  both as  an   interactive  research tool and for more production oriented tasks it   is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses hips   is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format either reel toreel or   sun  cartridge and comes with source code libraries a library of   convolu tion masks and online documentation and manual pages    michael landy sharpimage

working   for alex goetz  you might try contacting them if you already have idl   or would be willing to buy it  its a few thousand dollars american i   expect for idl and the other should be free  those are the general   purpose packages ive heard of besides what terramar has   sips was written for aviris imagery  im not sure how general purpose   it is  you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask  i   have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification you can compute an image using selected components  ive   used it on 00 megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best   speed you need an external dsp card  it will work without it but large   images take quite a while 0000 times as long to process  thats a   freebie if you want it    my  favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems   inc  idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its   programming language is very strong and easy  very pascallike it   handles the numbercrunching very well also personally i like doing   the numbercrunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even   excel on the mac if its not too hairy then bringing it over to nih   image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldnt handle and the speed and ease of use   compared to iraf was incredible by the way its mostly astronomical   image processing which ive been doing this means image enhancement   cleaning up bad linespixels and some other traditional image   processing routines then for example taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line i choose with the mouse then doing a curve   fit to that line which i might do like in kaleidagraph    for idl call research systems  for pvwave call precision visuals and  for sips call university of colorado  boulder  from what i can  understand you can get packaged

applications   host configuration requirements    it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun   though there  were rumors there are always rumors that the software   would be  ported to pc and possibly a sun environment  pci    a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes   an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i   forget  the software is available in versions for msdos unix   workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly   other platforms by now  i use the vms version    the pci software consists of several classesgroupspackages of   utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci   database disk file  the tape io package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape   formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file   this is the only package i use or know much about  other packages can   display data from the pci database to one or another of several   pcisupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer eg an epsontype   dotmatrix graphics printer  you might be more spe cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and   fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg   multiply channel 0 by 0 add channel 0 and store as channel 0 and   god only knows what all else  theres a lot  i dont have and dont   use these so cant say much about them you only buy the packages your   particular applicationinterest calls for    each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from   a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default   directory  some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations  the standard pci environment contains a   scripting language very similar to ibmpc basic but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  in vms i can also   invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure  theres   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the pci   data structures database file parameter file    the pci software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but   requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the   level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well  for instance the tape io package offers a   utility for reading headerless multiband what adobe photoshop on the   macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different   interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphicarts industrys ct0t format would probably i havent tried   handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what   youre doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start   over  its worth noting that the pci database file is designed to   contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of   other information i observe that a remotesensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude   longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this   can go into the pci database    i believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  on vax   systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific   thirdparty display systems the name goulddeanza seems to come to   mind  one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vctq qbus   00bit directcolor display subsystem  pci software could be overkill   in your case it seems designed for the very high end   applicationsusers ie those for whom a macpc largely doesnt suffice   although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  its   probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which   does a lot of its landresource management via remote sensing i believe   the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these   areas  spam spectral analysis manager    back in 0000 jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis   manager which got a fair amount of use at the time  that was designed   for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data  000 pixels   across by  000 lines by  000 bands a modified version has since   been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging   spectrometer which uses much larger images    spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and   ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays   actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   stretching  spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering    the original spam uses x or sunview to display  the aviris version may   require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame   buffer  i can refer you to people if youre interested  pcw requires x   for display  map ii    among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley  clrview    clrview is a

   hi everyone  since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from 0 points i suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse from its offset for example given 0 points on the offset can you find the original ellipse analytically  i spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year but i failed under the pressure i had to use other method  nonlinear programming technique to deal with this problem approximately  any ideas will be greatly appreciated please post here let the others share our interests  yeh usc

    i am working on a project where we are going to be including both still and moving grapics within a database  of course jpeg and mpeg come to mind as the formats of choice for the various files  however from what i read on the net it seems as if there are several different forms of each of these  what i want to do is settle on a file format which i can count on as being a standard format 00 years from now  i know apple is going to support quicktime on the new power pcs and so this may be the format of choice  what format does apples quicktime use for their products  i guess it is some kind of mpeg for their motion picture is it any different than standard mpeg files  thanx for any info  art pollardaxraybyuedu

add a line such as path mynamemysite to specify your correct email address to reply to      0  what is jpeg  jpeg pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 0bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   0  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 00bitperpixel color data instead of 0bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 0 mbyte fullcolor file down to 000 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 00 bitspixel 00 million colors instead of 0 or less 000 or fewer colors  if you have only 0bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 0bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 0 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   0  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 00bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 0 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 00 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 000 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 0 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 00 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   0  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 000x000 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 0b  file   size in bytescomments  shipppm0000000  original file in ppm format no compression 00 bits  or 0 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead shipppmz 000000  ppm file passed through unix compress  compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note  other textoriented compressors give similar results shipgif 000000  converted to gif with ppmquant fs 000  ppmtogif  most of the savings is the result of losing color  info gif saves 0 bitspixel not 00  see sec 0  shipjpg00 000000  cjpeg q 00    highest useful quality setting  this is indistinguishable from the 00bit original  at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00    default setting  you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this  from the original even with both onscreen at once shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  this has slight defects if you know what to look  for you could tell its been jpeged without seeing  the original  still as good image quality as many  recent postings in usenet pictures groups shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  jpegs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent  at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some  still ive seen plenty of usenet postings that were  of poorer image quality than this shipjpg0o   0000  cjpeg q 0 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead  blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or  indexing purposes  note that this file is tiny  the compression ratio from the original is 0000   in this case jpeg can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 00 file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   0  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 00 does not mean keep 00 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 00 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 00 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 00 saying q 000 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 00 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 00 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 00 is about right for compressing 00bit images but q 00 to 00 is usually better for converting gifs see section 00 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 0 to 00 is about right  q 0 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 0b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   0  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   0a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  john bradleys free xv version 000 and up is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu or ftpcisupennedu  the file is called xvtarz where  is the version number currently 000 it is located in the contrib directory on export or the pubxv directory at upenn  xv reduces all images to 0 bits internally which means its not a real good choice if you have a 00bit display youll still get only 0bit color  also you shouldnt use xv to convert fullcolor images to jpeg because theyll get colorquantized first but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other 0bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in versions 000 and earlier be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 00bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 000  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage000tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v0 decoder while xloadimage 000 is using a hackedover v0  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli000tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 00bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os0 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 00a is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 000000000 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg00azip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 000 or 000000 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 00 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv00zip  hiview requires a 000 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm000 and 000max work windows and os0 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 00  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview00zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv0zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel00 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 000a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 00  available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw000azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic00 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg0zip or jpeg0000zip if you have a 000 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 0b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif0jpgjpg0gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 00bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 00 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif0jpg0zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy  this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats  it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 000 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsalch000zip  note about simtel00 the internets key archive site for pcrelated programs is simtel00 full name wsmrsimtel00armymil 0000000000  simtel00 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel00 that really means pd0msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel00  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel00 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 00000000000 which keeps simtel00 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel00 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel00 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 00 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 00 and 000ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version 00 is available from ftpcicaindianaedu 000000000 file pubpcwin0desktopjview000zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchivewustledu  winjpeg shareware 00 displays jpeggiftargatiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and slideshow  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows0winjp000zip  this is a slow 000compatible version if you register youll get the 000only version which is roughly 00 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 00  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 000 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin0desktopcview000zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos  dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in

most mac jpeg programs rely on apples jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a 00000 or better cpu and you need to be running system 000 or later  if youre running system 0 you must also install the 00bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 0  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 0000 this file contains quicktime 00 which is better than qt 00 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 00  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 00 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 00 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 000000 file infomacappjpegview00hqx  requires system 0 and quicktime  on 0bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 000x000 pixels on a typical 0mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 00 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 000  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter000hqx  requires system 000 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert00hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v00 a jpeggif converter based on an old version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt00stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 00bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 0 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 00bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress000hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 00bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 000 or later can read and write jfifformat jpeg files use the jpeg plugin from the acquire menu  you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it  amiga  most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at

software you are welcome to join   0  whats all this hoopla about color quantization  most people dont have fullcolor 00 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 0 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 000 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 0bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 000orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 000 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 000color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 000 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 000 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 000color gif on a 00color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan0bit display hardware already 00bit hicolor pc displays true 00bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   0  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart00  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   0  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 000 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v0 free jpeg code you can also say sample 0x0 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 00bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 0 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 0 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   00  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 00 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 00 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 0a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 00 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif0jpgjpg0gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   00  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  0  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d0 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 00 followed by jfif  0  if you see ff d0 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  0  hsi files start with hsi0  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  0  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d0 and you should be able to read it  0  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d0     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  begin line mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  begin line mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   00  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 0 or 00 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   00  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 00 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    00  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 0 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 000 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 00 or 00rd the size of the gif file not 00th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 00 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 00 to 00 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 000 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v0 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 00 or so when converting gifs values of 00 to 00 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 00 smooth 00 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information

  i plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as i have working code which i will also include  the intersection of 0 planes method looks best but my implementation based on a short article in  graphics gems i doesnt work  i may be misinterpreting of course  i had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products but the former may actually be better  in either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed implicitly in the solution of linear equations  to get the planes i was taking the midpoint of the line from say p0 to p0 and setting the normal as the normalized vector from p0 to p0 these just plugged into the formula in graphics gems  however the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 0 of my test points for different tests  my matrixvector math is very rusty but it looks like i need to verify the formula or use the simultaneous equation solution which will require bringing in another routine i dont have but should be easy to find  another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 0 sets of 0 points and intersecting the normals from there  this would also define the circle center  however small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect  supposedly 0 planes have to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel  ed  thanks to all who answered so far   ed bolson university of washington  cardiovascular research               0000000000 bolsonuwashingtonedu preferred bolsonmaxbitnet                bolsonmiltonuwashingtonedu if you must

  first off thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the 00000 i assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for further enhancements to the motorola line rather than meted out to another company ah well i guess thats what i get when i assume the computer industry will operate in a logical manner   muchado ricardorchlandvnetibmcom writes    sean i dont want to get into a miniwar by what i am going to say but i have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the centris youll see why please noflames i reserve those for csma       i was in chicago in the last consumer electronics show and apple had a booth there  i walked by and they were showing realtime video capture using a radious or supermac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies  i think the quicktime they were using was the old one 00  version 00 of quicktime is as has been stated the current version of the software the older version is 00 and 00 is on the horizon in the not too distant future     they digitized a guy talking there in 000x0xx something  it played back quite nicely and in real time  the guy then expanded the window resized to 00x by 0xx 000 in y i think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasnt 00fps or about 00fps anymore  it dropped to like 00 fps  then he increased it just a bit more and it dropped to 0000 fps   quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it does playing back resized movies apparently the process of expanding each frames image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate bit depth is pretty processorintensive there are optimizers that work pretty well for showing movies at double size but if you drop to 00x size or increase to 00x size performance suffers dramatically     then i asked him what mac he was using he was using a quadra dont know what model 000 to do it and he was telling the guys there that the quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an lcii  he lied  quicktime is very cpu dependent he was probably confused by the fact that qt is locked to an internal timecode and will play in the same amount of time on any machine however an lc will drop frames in order to keep the sound and video synced up  the centris and quadras have similar cpus and will thus boast similar performance though the quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture     well i spoiled his claim so to say since a 00000 quadra mac was having a little bit of trouble  and this wasnt even from the hardisk  this was from memory     could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assisted centris or another software product running the  animation like supposedly macrominds accelerator  i expect that the version of the quicktime software you saw was 00  i was using was 00 one of the new codecs in v00 allows video at nearly twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 00 could handle the centris 000 i saw was a plainvanilla with the exception of the nice speakers that were playing the sound and the software was movie player the qt player apple includes with the software     dont misunderstand me i just want to clarify this  no problem  it still surprises me that quicktime is able to do the things it does as well as it can  sean mcmains               check out the gopher     phone0000000000 university of north texas  new bands info server    fax  0000000000 po box 00000             at seanmacacsuntedu   email denton tx 00000                                      mcmainsuntedu

  lets say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything  on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true xy positions are known    now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danons excellent digitize program  that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to xy and saves those values when you click the mouse  upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values  this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you  the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretchingcontracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory  so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion  in particular if i have three sets of points   referencexy the known true values  distortedreferencexy the same points with known errors  distorteddataxy other points with unknown errors  what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors  i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy 0d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points  any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas or better yet pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems  thanks  earl

  lets say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything  on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true xy positions are known    now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danons excellent digitize program  that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to xy and saves those values when you click the mouse  upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values  this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you  the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretchingcontracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory  so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion  in particular if i have three sets of points   referencexy the known true values  distortedreferencexy the same points with known errors  distorteddataxy other points with unknown errors  what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors  i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy 0d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points  it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion  or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion  below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions feel free to poke me via email   assume locally smooth distortion  0 compute the delaunay triangulation of your xy points  this    defines the set of neighbors for each point  if your data are    not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull    consider deleting these edges  0 now there are two goals      a move the distorteddataxy to the referencexy     b keep the lengthe as measured from the current xys        as close as possible to the digitizedlengthe as measured         using the digitized xys  0 for every point compute a displacement based on a and b  for    example      a for xy points for which you know the referencexy you        can move alpha0referencexy  currentxy   this will        slowly move the distortedreferencexy towards the        referencexy      b for all other points examine the current length of each edge        for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength         take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the        point alpha0sumofedgedisplacements  this will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh  0 iterate 0 until you are happy for example no point moves very much  alpha0 and alpha0 need to be determined by experimentation   consider how much you believe the referencexy  ie do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges  warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially you cant allow the convex hull to change and you cant allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles  both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically retriangulating the points using  the current positions  but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions  when we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once  if i were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 0 years i might go back and retriangulate on every iteration  if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other pointbut first read up on linear solutions to the nbody problem  there are lots of papers in the last 00 years of siggraph proceedings on springs constraints  and energy

   about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult  i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published  solutions to it  the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines  for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional ie only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space  to draw  the object we   0 fit a cubic spline through the points  each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve  each spline has an equal number of segments  we assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure 0 take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline  use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface 0 depth sort the triangles 0 take each triangle in sorted order project onto a 0d pixmap draw and color the triangle  take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color  it is the edge coloring in step 0 that is at the heart of the problem  the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface  the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines  if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area  thanks

   getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape is harder than it looks  the standard vga and ega outputs are  very different than the ntsc format used by televisions  while there is equipment that will do the conversion it is hard to get your hands on and costs quite a bit  if you have access to an amiga computer that has an ntsc output you can transfer certain types of graphic files by modem and tape them from the ntsc output  unfortunately this would be framebyframe and would lead to unbelievably scratchy animation unless you had a good amiga animation program  otherwise see if your local public access cable station has equipment that you can use

   hi everyone  because no one has touched the problem i posted last week i guess my question was not so clear now id like to describe it in detail  the offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse in other words the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere  this problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used the tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the balls center is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse the answer is no ironically dmis  an american indutrial standard says it is ellipse so almost all the software which was implemented on the base of dmis was wrong the software was also sold internationaly imagine how many people have or will suffer from this bug how many qualified parts with ellipse werewill be discarded and most importantly how many defective parts with ellipse arewill be used  i was employed as a consultant by a company in los angeles last year to specially solve this problem i spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming now my solution nonlinear is not ideal because i can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset it is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method i used is not analytical i am now wondering if i didnt touch the base and make things complicated please give me a hint  i know you may argue this is not a cg problem you are right it is not however so many people involved in the problem sphere from 0 poits why not an ellipse and why not its offset  please post here and let the others share our interests  i got several emails from our netters they said they need the summary of the answers  yeh usc

  tsacellarorg the silent assassin writes rgc0000bcsteccaboeingcom robert g carpenter writes   can you please offer some recommendations  its really not that hard to do  there are books out there which explain everything and the basic 0d functions translation rotation shading and hidden line removal are pretty easy  i wrote a program in a few weeks witht he help of a book and would be happy to give you my source  i think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel   yes i want to concentrate on other development issues  ive created graphics  libraries before its too time consuming lifes too short  also quickdraw has a lot of 0d functions built in and think pascal can access them and i would expect that think c could as well  if you can find out how to use the quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the mac so should be fast  just to clarify the 0d routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray not the rom of the mac  a few years ago before i knew anything about implementing graphics i came across a demo of the apple grafsys0d library and it actually did a lot  however it is quite limited in the sense that its a lowlevel 0d library your code still has to plot individual points draw each line etc ad nauseum  it has nothing on gl for example where you can handle objects   thanks for the clarification before posting my original request i had looked  into the macs 0d capabilities and dismissed them as low grade  bobc

   the idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon not necessarily rectangular as a window  my problem then is in finding out all the new vertices of the resulting subpolygons from the first one  is this simply a matter of extending the usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked against another polygon  is there a simpler way  comments welcome  noel

  please note the newsgroups  recent discussion about xvs problems were held in some newsgroup here is some text users of xv might find interesting i have added more to text to this collection article so read on even you so my articles a while ago  i hope author of xv corrects those problems as best he can so fine program xv is that it is worth of improving i have also minor ideas for 00bit xv email me for them  any misundertanding of mine is understandable   juhana kouhia   clip   deleted  note that xv saves only 0bitrasterized images that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpegtogiftojpeg quality also theres three kind of 0bit quantizers your final image quality depends on them too   this were the situation when i read jpeg faq a while ago   imho it is design error of xv there should not be such confusing errors in programs theres two errors   xv allows the saving of 0bitrasterized image as jpeg even the    original is 00bit  saving 0bitrasterized image instead of    original 00bit should be a special case   xv allows saving the 0bitrasterized image made with any quantizer     the main case should be that xv quantizes the image with the    best quantizer available before saving the image to a file lousier    quantizers should be just for viewing purposes and a special cases    in saving the image if at all   clip  clip   deleted  it is limit of xv but not limit of design it is error in design it is error that 0bitquantizedrasterized images are stored as jpegs jpeg is not designed to that  as matter of fact im sure when xv were designed 00bit displays were known it is not bad error to program a program for 0bit images only at that time but when 00bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 00bit images that were not done and now we have  the program violate jpeg design and any 00bit image format  the program has human interface errors  otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 00bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use   deleted   clip  some new items follows  clip  i have seen that xv quantizes the image sometimes poorly with best00 option than with default option we have the reason surely is the quantizer used as best00 it is surprise the same than used in ppmquant  if you remember i have tested some quantizers in that test i found that rlequant with default is best then comes djpeg fbmquant xv our default in that order in my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly  it actually gave image with bad artifacts  i dont know is ppmquant improved any but i expect no so use of xvs best00 option is not very good idea  i suggest that author of xv changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant  im sure rlepeople gives permission another could be one used in imagemagick i have not tested it so i can say nothing about it  clip  clip  some minor bugs in human interface are  key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer often it happens that i make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place it is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately the buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete  also good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for xv after the image is completed often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly just when im writing something with editor or such those key pressings then go to xv and image has gone or something weird  in the color editor when i turn a color meter and release it xv updates the images it is impossible to change all rgb values first and then get the updated image it is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet i suggest of adding an apply button to update the exchanges done  clip

  in 0qjrecqemnetworkucsdedu splivemucsdedu steve lamont writes  what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that  we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the  crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck  it should have been made fairly clear that the most crimson would ever get was a 000 00 old style mhz cpu upgrade  certainly this was mentioned on compsyssgi on more than one occasion as being likely  if our sales folks were saying otherwise they were either confused or less than honestethical or somebody further up the chain inside sgi was misleading them   im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a  previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around  for a while rather than being flushed  there were 0 versions 00 00 00 00 although admittedly the 00 came out at the same time as the 00 over a period of 0 00 years  the chassis simply couldnt be pushed any further  id say 0 years was a pretty good lifespan myself for a system design in this day and age  getting the 00 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups we would have been out of our minds to push it further and i know that was made clear almost from the day the 00 started shipping  we had one last kicker in the form of the elan graphics which made 0 graphics versions over its lifespan which i also think is pretty good   now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to  keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself  pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books  just before the end of the quarter but im just a little tired of  getting boned in the process  please by all means send a complaint letter through sgi support or sales on your concerns  there should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers sure sometimes there will be confusion for a while over whether an upgrade will be available but that shouldnt last too long and doesnt seem to be what you are referring to  yes the sales folks do get bonuss at the end of some all quarters but that is pretty common industry wide and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that arent what they need im sure but nobody is forcing you to buy at end of quarter after all   maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we  arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa  for instance are  this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs  they dont get all that long a lead time either although certainly they get presentations on possible new products and their opinions may well influence the end product but that also is life in the industry  we cant design systems that meet just their needs or we wont sell too many systems after all which is not to say that we dont have some niche products like reality engine   and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers  every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis  the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the  entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond  that  means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i  have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one  previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other  vendor  im going to be looking at this box for the next five years  and every time i look at it im going to think about sgi and how i  could have better spent my money actually your money since were  supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars  but surely you dont expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period  thats a rather unreasonable expectation in my experience with workstationsmicrocomputers  supported and parts available yes but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest   now youll have to pardon me while i go off and hiss and fume in a  corner somewhere and think dark libelous thoughts  i missed your first posting but as i say by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside sgi where it might have an effect not immediate im sure but complaints arent going to be ignored and may affect future plans if we  hear similar things from more than one personsite  all of the above is as usual my personal opinion not sgis  let no one tell me that silence gives consent     dave olson because whoever is silent dissents                silicon graphics inc     maria isabel barreno                           olsonsgicom ps i start my sabbatical 00 may ask those questions now

     the otis project 00          the operative term is stimulate    this file last updated00000   what is otis  otis is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny     and distribution  digital immortality  the basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around nearforever  the gifs and jpgs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future  perhaps theyll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapesbut theyll be thereand someone will dig them up     if that doesnt interest you otis also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your worksa virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors  suddenly life is  breathed into your workand by merit of its stimulus it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons   spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts  keep your own copies of the images to look at when youve got the gumption thats what theyre here for    where               otis currently as of 00000 has two ftp sites      0000000000 projectsotis the uwi site  sunsiteuncedu pubmultimediapicturesotis the sunsite  you can also gopher to this site for otis as well  merely anonymous ftp to either site on internet and change to the appropriate directory  dont forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure youre in binary  otis has also been spreading to some dialup bbs systems around north americathe following systems have a substancial supply of otistuff underground cafe omaha 0000000000 0 lines cyberden sanfran 0000000000  usenet waffleiron     how do you contribute                what happens isyou draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo get it scanned into an image file then either ftpput it in the contribincoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me email addresses at eof in email  after the image is received it will be put into the correct directory  computer originated works are also welcome  otis directories house two types of image files gif and jpg   gif and jpg files require oddly enough a gif or jpg viewer to  see  these viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large ftp sites around internet  jpg viewers are a bit tougher to find  if you cant find one but do have a gif viewer   you can obtain a jpgtogif conversion program which will change     jpg files to a standard gif format   otis also accepts animation files        when you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people to view  also include some biographical information on yourself well be having infofiles on each contributing artist and their works  you  can also just upload a textfile of info about yourself instead of  emailing  if you have pictures but no scanner there is hope  merely send copies to  the otis project co ed stastny po bx 000000 omaha ne 000000000  i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them  include an ample sase if you want your stuff back   also include information on each image preferably a 00 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where its finally put  if you have preferences as to what the images are to be named include those as well     conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and well arrange things  if you want to submit your works by disk peachy  merely send a 00 disk to the above address omaha and a sase if you want your disk back this is good for people who dont have direct access to encoders or ftp but do have access to a scanner  we accept disks in either mac or ibm compatible format  if possible please submit image files as gif or jpg  if you cantwe can convert from most formatswed just rather not have to  at senders request we can also fill disks with as much otis as they can stand  even if you dont have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an sase or 000 for disk postage and packing to  get a slabootis  as of 000000 were at about 00 megabytes of files and growing   email me for current archive size and directory    distribution  the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another  in fact we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such  if you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images     it would also be nice if youd send me a note when you did post images from otis to your local bbs  i just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is  its the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as possible  if you have the time please upload a few to your favorite bbs systemor even just post this infofile there  it would be keen of you    use  if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory youll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit  you will either find this in the rm file for     the image or series of imagesor in the artists directory under the  artists name  if permission isnt explicitly given then youll have  to contact the artist to ask for it  if no info is available email me edcwisunomahaedu and ill get in contact with the artist for  you or give you their contact information   when you do use permitted work its always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files    naming images  please keep the names of your files in dos format  that means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less  the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number thus leonardo devincis fifth mechanical drawing would be something like   ldmek0gif     or    ldmek0jpg    or    ldmech0gif   etc  keeping the names under 0 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems        creating image files  when creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture  this gives people a reference in case theyd like to contact you  you may also want to include a title address or other information youd like people to know    hmmm  thats about it for now  more guidelines will be added as needed your input is

   our shop uses a package called cadcore  very good  to scan and subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps the problem is that once the raster file is loaded into the cadcore package a header is added to the hrf file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter we would like to be able to ship some of the alreadyaltered raster images for further use on our workstations so here are my questions   0 what is the hitachi format  i need this format so i can recognize precisely what to strip out i strongly suspect that its a compressed format  if so then t might not be possible for me to strip out the offending header   0 are there any unix packages that read and recognize hrf it would be really nice to find some sort of hrftopbm converter out there    ive already searched some of the more wellknown ftp sites which contain graphics formats documentation with no luck so if you know or knwo someone who knows  please email thanks

   printer model and specification  canon clc 000 color laser copier psipu unit postscript intelligent processing unit   hello  we have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copierprinter  we want to be able to print to it from our sgi iris network  the  copierprinter has both a parallel and scsi interface  i have configured the printer with the lp system using the parallel interface and can print  postscript files to the printer  i can also print rgb files but these are in  turn converted to postscript by an internal filter  the canon clc 000 is a  publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts  are less than acceptable  we create the postscript files with a variaty of  programs such as showcase xv and tops  when we convert to postscript  with tops and use the l option to specify the halftone screen density of 00  rather than the default 00 the output is better but still much less that  acceptable  note that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript  we suspect that if we could use the scsi interface we would get higher quality  pictures  we have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the  scsi port  to my knowledge this software is 0000 and does not come with a  warranty  the management here does not want to spend this much money without  some assurance that the product will work   here my questions  if anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the scsi or  parallel port  what is the quality of the printouts  is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts  what is the limiting component the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on  the printer   the big question  where can i get some software to drive the scsi port for this printer    please email directly to me i dont not read news on a regular basis  i will post a summary  thanks in advance    emailscottncifcrfgov phone 000 0000000         title  sr systems manageranalyst

  preston writes  why not use the pd c library for readingwriting tiff files it took me a  good 00 minutes to start using them in your own app  i certainly do use it whenever i have to do tiff and it usually works very well  thats not my point  im philosophically opposed to it because of its complexity  this complexity has led to some programs poor tiff writers making some very bizarre files other programs inability to load tiff images though theyll save them of course and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand tiff  as the saying goes its not me im worried about its all the other  assholes out there  ive had big trouble with misuse and abuse of tiff over the years and i chalk it all up to the immense and unnecessary complexity of the format  in the words of the tiff 00 spec appendix g page g0 capitalized emphasis mine  the only problem with this sort of success is that tiff was designed to be powerful and flexible at the expense of simplicity  it takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification probably no application does a complete job and that is currently the only way you can be sure that you will be able to import any tiff image since there are so many imagegenerating applications out there now   if a program or worse all applications cant read every tiff image that means there are some it wont some that i might have to deal with  why would i want my images to be trapped in that format  i dont and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning not that anyone does of course   ab

  there is another useful method based on least sqyares estimation of the sphere equation parameters  the points xyz on a spherical surface with radius r and center abc can be written as      xa0  yb0  zc0  r0  this equation can be rewritten into the following form       0ax  0by  0cz  r0  a0  b0 c0  x0  y0  z0  approximate the left hand part by   fxyz  p0x  p0x  p0z  p00  for all datapoints ic 0 determine the 0 parameters p0p0 which minimise the average error fxyz  x0  y0  z00  in numerical recipes in c can be found algorithms to solve these parameters  the best fitting sphere will have   center abc  p00 p00 p00  radius r  sqrtp0  aa  bb  cc  so at last will this solve you sphere estination problem at least for the most situations i think   quick van rijt rytg0feltnonl

  if this question is covered elsewhere i apologize but i need information fast  my department has been given a large sum of money to install a video system on our network of ibm rs0000 workstations  this is not an area in which i have any expertise so i wonder if anyone out there can offer advice  we would like a system based either on vhs or 0mm video which will allow one  write video frame by frame on tape for playback in real time  its for visualization of physics problems  can anyone tell me what hardware is available which would work for our system  some support software is obviously needed too but nothing particularly sophisticated since the software we actually use for the visualization is all already written  please email with replies as i dont read this group  many thanks for your help  dr m e j newman department of physics cornell university newmmeheliostncornelledu

     hi im just getting into povray and i was wondering if there is a graphic  package that outputs pov files  any help would be appreciated  thanks    a very good modeling package i found is irit look for irittarz however there is no converter from its format to pov format i postet  a request for such a converter in this group but got no response so im considering to write such a program myself     sebastian schmidt tu ilmenau institut f praktische informatik    
   ive got a 000 00hz computer which is under warranty and my trident 0000c video card is starting to playup surprise surprise therefore im going to try to exchange it for a better card  the big question is  which video card is high quality and with an acceptable price tag on student budget   thank you in advance    
  for some reason i never saw the original post on this thread but if you are looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a pc you really cant go past the mode x stuff from dr dobbs this code is all pdomain as far as i know and in the original articles the routines were all presented as dumb vga routines and then optimised to modex with some interesting discussion along the way if you are interested i could find out more details of the issues in question i have them at home  bernard

   has anyone created any interesting animations using dmorph i seem to be unable to create anything that looks remotely realistic although this is probably due to the crappy gifs at i am using one of captain kirk and one of spock im a bit of a trekker  what are the best type of pictures to use thanks             asitunayake

      i bought the diamond stealth 00 a few months ago  it seems to be a great card especially with my multimedia presentations  it runs graphics and animation as well as some near full motion video very well  the only thing i can tell that it lacks is speed above 000 colors  its qualit in between 000 and 000 million collors un unreal but you definitly compromise speed  it seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes with some great software but im not so sure about the excelerator part  i used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster than that  one thing i do like is that it loads its own vesa driver from rom at startup i think because i have never had to load it for links000 or any other programs that require special vesa drivers at startup     gromi a00pd                                          hintmattbabaisuedu

  hi there  i am very interested in rayshade 000 i have managed to make a chessboard for rayshade unfortunately i still have to do the knight horse any ideas i am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces the board is marble unfortunately black wont work very well for the one side anybody with ideas for nice surfaces  i would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield command unfortunately the manual is very vague about this and i dont have craig kolbs email address anybody with ideas because this is essential for my next venture into raytracing  where should i post the finished chessboard  is there anybody else using rayshade on nonunix systems  how fast does unix render  thanks  rayshade is the best program for people who loves graphics but have no artistic talent

    hi netters   i am currently doing some investigations on developable surface  can anyone familiar with this topic give me some information or sources  which can allow me to find some infomation of developable surface  thanks for your help   abel  h0000000hkuxahkuhk  a developable surface is st you can lay it or roll it flat on the plane it may require you to give it a cut though  eg a cylinder a cone a plane of course or any surface or patch having vanishing gaussian intrinsic curvature ie with singular hessian the matrix of 0nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch are developable in more technical words a developable surface is locally isometric to a plane at all points   think also of the sphere or the earth which in a nondevelopable whatever ways you cut it you will not be able to lay flat any pieces of it its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing  for more details on this look at any book on differential geometry which treats surfaces 0d manifolds eg m do carmos book  bookcarmo00differential   author       do carmo manfredo p   title        differential geometry of curves and surfaces   year         0000   publisher    prenticehall   note         000 pages  enjoy   frederic leymarie  leyfremcrcimmcgilledu mcgill university electrical eng dept mcrcim    tel 000 0000000 0000 university st montreal qc canada h0a 0a0  fax  000 0000000  
                                im working upon a game using an isometric perspective similar to that used in populous  basically you look into a room that looks similar to the following                               xxxx                          xxxxx   xxxx                      xxxx    x       xxxx                  xxxx        x           xxxx              xxxx     0      xxxx     0      xxxx              x           xxxx    xxxx           x              x       xxxx            xxxx       x              x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x              xxxx              0          xxxx                  xxxx                 xxxx                      xxxx            xxxx                          xxxx    xxxx                              xxxx  the good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision   since your viewpoint is always the same the routines can be hardcoded for a particular vantage  in my case wall twos rising edge has a slope of 00 im also using mode x 000x000  ive run into two problems im sure that other readers have tried this before and have perhaps formulated their own opinions  0 the routines for drawing walls 0  0 were trivial but when i ran a packedplanar image through them i was dismayed by the jaggies  im now considered some antialiasing routines speed is not really necessary is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed thus being assured of nice image or is this too much of a burden  0 wall 0 presents a problem the algorithm i used tends to overly distort the original  i tried to decide on paper what pixels go where and failed has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape  currently i take    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  and produce                           0  0  0  0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  0  0  0  0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  0 00 00 00             00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                         00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                                     00 00 00 00  line 0 follows the slope  line 0 is directly under line 0 line 0 moves up a line and left 0 pixels  line 0 is under line 0 this fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels  but it causes distortions  has anyone come up with a better way perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed  are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective i was planning on having hidden plane removal by using zbuffering locations are stored in xyz form   for those of you who noticed the top lines of wall 0 and wall 0 are parallel with its bottom lines  this is why there appears to be an optical illusion ie it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube depending on your mood  there are no vanishing points this simplifies the drawing code for objects which dont have to change size as they move about in the room  ive decided that this approximation is alright since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing  hopefully the context of the picture ie chairs on the floor torches hanging on the walls will dispell any visual ambiguity  thanks in advance for any help    till next time                o   o                                 v o v     emailpinkytamuedu   sam  inala                   v

  i need information on the display postscript strokeadjust feature this feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices  the postscript literature explains the process to some extent  they also give an example of how to emulate strokeadjust in postscript environments where it is absent  the suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate  newcoord  round oldcoord  000  000  doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in 00  from reading i thought that what they might actually do is  newcoord  trunc oldcoord  0  0  000  this results in all the coordinates ending in either 000 or 000  whichever is closer  by doing some actual comparisons with display postscript i find that neither of these is what dps really uses  since i like how the dps result looks better than how my stuff looks id like to know if anyone who knows how dps does it is willingable to tell me  thanks  steve squeegeeworldstdcom

   yes i am aware coreldraw exports in scodal  but if you try to export in scodal with a bitmap it will say something like cannot export if anyone out there knows a way around this i am all ears  i think one not ideal solution is to use the tracing utility cant remember the name sorry included in the corel draw sw pack  it can convert bitmaps to corel art format  these can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap result  the file is completely in corel format and can be scodaled no problem  but the slight problem with this which makes the solution less than idea is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced  straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments  so the scodal taking much longer to image  the obvious solution is timeconsuming  stripping out the extra points by hand using corel  ouch ive done it a few times   i was just wondering if there was anything out there that just did the bitmap to scodal part a tad cheaper                     jeff lyall  as i say if you dont mind the problems go via the route bitmap  corel via trace  hand trimming using corel  combine with main corel pic via import  scodal  cheers    toby                                           toby freeman                          glasgow university                  freemantukacglasgowdcs

   i was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a 00bit graphics computerimage processing system  i seem to remember it being called image or something akin to that  anyway he claimed it had 00bit color  a 00bit alpha channel  thats 00 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  specifically the 00bit color  thats 000 trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  is this an antialiasing thing  or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor  also to settle a bet with my roommate what are sgis flagship products  i know of iris indigo and crimson but what are the other ones and which is their topoftheline sadly i have access to none of them  just a dec 000000  sigh  eric oehler oehlerpicardcswiscedu

   i am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a postscript type 0 or truetype font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 0d scanline renderer   i have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system well i now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so i would like to have some of my questions answered before i jump into the deep end  the main problem i face is how to use the evenodd or nonwinding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons for example in the letter o there are two outlines  0 the outside outline which is clockwise truetype font 0 the inside outline which is counterclockwise  one common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest this is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes the renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges  i do not want to use this simplistic system since  0 it will not handle all outline fonts properly it is not a simple matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some fancy fonts 0 it does not properly handle the evenodd or nonwinding rules  from my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids as is done by the postscript and truetype font rasterizers these trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 0d scanline renderer  my question is are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer i am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons  another question for those in the know what is the best algorithm to create bevelled andor offset curves for font outlines i have a dozen papers on these subjects but i cant tell which method is the best to implement  thanks for any pointers   rob lansdale    robert lansdale  000 0000000       dynamic graphics project internet lansddgptorontoedu        computer systems research institute uucp   uunetdgptorontoedulansd university of toronto bitnet  lansddgputoronto           toronto ontario m0s 0a0 canada

    hi all i am looking into methods i can use to turn my linux based bbs into a full color graphical bbs that supports pc mac linux and amiga callers  originally i was inspired by the naplps graphics standard a summary of  which hit this group about 0 weeks ago  following up on software availability of naplps supporting software i find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being pp0 which runs soley on msdos machines leaving mac and amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the bbs i know i wouldnt  next most interesting possibility is to port mgr to pc mac amiga i know there is an old version of a mac port on bellcorecom that doesnt work under system 0 but i cant seem to find the source anywhere to see if i can patch it  is there a color version of mgr for linux  i know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but i misplaced it  does anyone on this group know if mgr as been ported to pc or amiga  i cant seem to send a message to the mgr channel without it bouncing  does anyone have any other suggestions for a linux based gui bbs   thanks in advan

   yeah corel draw and wordperfect presentations pretty limited here too since theres no not really such thing as a decent raster to vector conversion program this tracing technique is about it  simple stuff like bw logos etc do pretty well while more complicated stuff goes haywire  i suspect even though i dont write code that a good bitmapped to vector conversion program would probably be as big as most of these application softwares were using  but even so how come one hasnt been written to my knowledge  i mean even hijaak one of the commercial industry standards of file conversion hasnt attempted it yet    mac mcdougald                      any opinions expressed herein   the photography center             are not necessarily actually  univ of tenn knoxville 00000     are almost certainly not those  macutkvxutkedu                  of the university of tennessee   macutkvxbitnet                        0000000000                     things are more like they are now       0000000000 fax                  than theyve ever been before

  ok with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime the effects of scaling and so on i thought id do some more tests  first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic the movie i had been using only had 00 frames in it it was a version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor i decided something a little longer would give closer to realworld results for better or for worse  i pulled out a copy of 0000 a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie theres a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized a portion of about 00 seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only 0 frames per second to give a total of 000 frames  i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 000000 pixels with the spigot card in my centris 000 quartersize resolution from a pal source i then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor keeping the 0 fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled to 000000 resolution the other at 000000 resolution i used the default 000 quality setting in premiere 000 and specified a key frame every ten frames  i then ran the 000000 movie through the same raw speed test program i used for the results id been reporting earlier  result a playback rate of over 00 frames per second  thats right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie just for fun i copied the 000000 movie to my external hard disk a quantum lp000s and ran it from there this time the playback rate was only about 00 frames per second obviously the 000mb internal hard disk also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback  i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors and tried playing back the 000000 movie scaled to 000000 size this time the playback speed was over 00 fps clearly the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 00 in action not 00 id try my tests with quicktime 00 but i dont think its entirely compatible with my centris and system 00  unscaled the playback rate for the 000000 movie was over 000 fps  the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 000000 movie with preferred playback rates greater than 00 and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer ie with quicktimes normal synchronized playback a preferred rate of 00  00 fps didnt work too well the playback was very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved 00 fps with ease i cant believe that quicktimes synchronization code would add this much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac systems task switching  a preferred rate of 00  00 fps seemed to work fine i couldnt see any evidence of stutter at 00  00 fps i think i could see slight stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell  i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even more  lawrence doliveiro                       fone 0000000000 computer services dept                     fax 0000000000 university of waikato            electric mail ldowaikatoacnz hamilton new zealand    00 00 00 s 000 00 0 e gmt0000

  howdy all  oehleryarcswiscedu wonko the sane writes  i was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a 00bit graphics computerimage processing system  i seem to remember it being called image or something akin to that  anyway he claimed it had 00bit color  a 00bit alpha channel  thats 00 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  specifically the 00bit color  thats 000 trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  is this an antialiasing thing  or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor  hmm 00 bit aye well it beats a 00bit design for thee sake of ellegance 00 bit means 00 bits per primary colour the 000 nr of colours is a bit misleading it makes more sense to see it as 00000 possible shades of pure red this might actually make some sense since 000 shades of red 00 bit colours  may produce visible jumps in intensity then again a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way  of doing colour graphics because it leaves ya such a tidy and fast program code  take care  bram    flying is a nack the trick is     bram stolk stolkfwiuvanl        to throw yourself at the ground     dept of maths  computer science   and miss   douglas adams        university of amsterdam                                               no i dont use mswindoze i prefer linux

  macutkvxbitnet richard j mcdougald writes  since theres no not really such thing as a decent raster to vector  conversion program this tracing technique is about it  simple stuff  like bw logos etc do pretty well while more complicated stuff goes  haywire  the first and only thing ive ever tried to autotrace was a piece of a uscg nautical chart using adobe illustrator 00  i wanted to get the outline of the coast for western long island sound  i was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did  i suspect what i gave it was a very difficult thing not only is the coastline very irregular but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines not only lattitude and longitude but loran grids as well  the most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast  i think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say no dummy youre going the wrong way  steve reisberg a friend of mine a few years back did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage virii a good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles this is essentially the same problem that illustrator tries to solve with its autotrace tool  in some respects the problem steve worked on was harder since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step but a step on which all future analysis depended  however in other respects it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight clean and well imaged you dont always have that freedom autotracing real life images  in any case it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case   steve is no longer with us  he and his wife disappeared while on vacation in hawaii a couple of years after they graduated  their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area  while no bodies were ever found they are presumed to have been the victim of some sort of fall or accident in the woods   roy smith roynyuedu hippocrates project department of microbiology coles 000 nyu school of medicine 000 first avenue new york ny 00000 this never happened to bart simpson

  ospreyux0csouiucedu lucas adamski writes  in article 0000pdxgateuucp idrrigelcspdxedu ian d romanick writes what kind of polygons  shaded  texturemapped  hm  more comes into play with fast routines than just polygons  it would be nice to know exaclty what system vga is a start but what processor and a few of the specifics of the implementation  you need to give  more info if you want to get any answers p  i dont want texture mapped cause if i did id asked for them   just a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons  as for the processor itd be for a minimum of a 000 maybe 000 if i cant find a good one for 000s ideally i want a polyn function that can clip to a userdefined viewport and write to an arbitrary location in memory  of course the chances of  ok it is for a game that is 0d and you have listed the characteristics  that you are looking for i think you may have left out a few  important parameters  the polygons are all convex  they have less than n sides you are drawing meshes walls doors etc  i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave  self intersecting polygons  this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that  simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line complex figure 0 type polygons can be a bit trickier  the less than n sides specification especially if it is a very small  number like 0 or 0 allow othe optimisations to be made  thus for a high speed game application i think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons    finding something like that are pretty remote so i guess id need the source with it  oh and i guess it would need to be in asm otherwise itd be too slow  ive seen some polygon routines in c and theyve all been waaay too slow  its for a 0d vector graphics program  ive been hunting high and low  it may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms if you limit yourself to 0 or four sided simple convex polygons i think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a  asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be   for a polyn function in asm and i cant find one anywhere that i can use ive found one or two polyn functions but my asm is pretty bad so i wont even try to rewrite them  lucas

angle  the obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination this is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination  instead loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the reverse transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the source this method is quite general and can be used for any onetoone 0d mapping not just rotation  you can add antialiasing by doing subpixel sampling  however there is a much faster method with antialising included which involves doing three shear operations  the method was originally created for the im raster toolkit see below an implementation is also present in pbmplus  reference a fast algorithm for raster rotation by alan paeth

messages saying i cant ftp could someone mail this to me  there are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message  see item 00 below for details on some  also the newsgroup altgraphicspixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this  you may find useful information there   0 format documents for tiff iff biff nff off fits etc  you almost certainly dont need these  read the above item 0 on free image manipulation software  get one or more of these packages and look through them  chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there  but if you still want one of the format documents many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhofcsriceedu in directory pubgraphicsformats  these files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct this archive includes pixel formats and two and threedimensional object formats  the future of this archive is uncertain at the moment as mark hall foocsriceedu will apparently no longer be maintaining it  a second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by quincey koziol koziolncsauiucedu  the latest version exists at ftpncsauiucedu in miscfileformatsgraphicsformats  apparently neither of these is complete you might want to check both  fits stands for flexible image transport system its a file format most often used in astronomy  despite the name it can contain not only images but other things as well  there is a regular monthly fits basics and information posting on sciastrofits  read it if you want to know more    0 converting between vector formats  a lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript or macdraw to cgm or whatever  it is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 0  converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel  the basic objects are the same for all image formats  this is not so for vector formats the basic objects  circles ellipses dropshadowed patternfilled roundcornered rectangles etc  vary from one format to another except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a onetoone conversion between vector formats  there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftppscedu  the contributor states that it runs on unix mswindows and possibly the mac a better more specific blurb would be most welcome  on the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another as far as i know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been posted to compsourcesmisc  check the index on your nearest archive site  a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image  from postscript to sun raster format or hpgl to x00 bitmap  for example some of the commercial postscript clones for pcs allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer  also the postscript interpreters in the next box and in suns x00news can be used to render to a file if youre clever  but in general the answer is no  however if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial  gnu ghostscript from the fsf  current version 000 includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a postscript to ppm  or a postscript to gif filter  it implements essentially all of postscript level 0 and alot of display postscript and level 0   00 how to get pixar films  the various john lasseter  pixar computer animated shorts are

consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity  if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the polygon  if the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges  this idea is known in the trade as the jordan curve theorem see eric haines article in glassners ray tracing book above for more information including treatment of special cases  another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon  if the sum is 0 pi the point is inside if the sum is 0 the point is outside  however this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly  code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in the ray tracing news vol 0 no 0 available from princetonedu pubgraphicsrtnewsrtnv0n0z   00

   a good reason which is why many companies use it for 00 bits  pixel is so you can use double buffering for animating scenes  ie you have 0  00bit planes you write to the one in the background and then flip   the entire screen updates to the second imageplane the screen updates  in one refresh and you dont see different objects appearing in the order  that theyre drawn as in the cadmacdraw effect now your ready to update  the image that used to be in the foreground  steve thssstbiitmaxiitedu  irisiitedu  about the sg product line who can even keep track nowadays every co seems to as their ads  press releases claim redefine computing etc etc as we know it with each new product progress and competition are great but who wants to invest in a system thats obsolete by the time it reaches your desk

  i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave  self intersecting polygons  this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that  simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line complex figure 0 type polygons can be a bit trickier  it is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concavemulti outline algorithm but not tremendously faster  i spent awhile implementing and optimizing both flavors and the convex turned out about 00 faster  this is all c on hp parisc the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as fast as possible as far as i could tell  for any sort of game the database to render is known ahead of time and can be made all convex  definitely the way to go  ps sorry but my code cannot be made public domain jesse   jesse lackey    0deye inc ithaca ny    jesseeyecom    000 0000000

  chris herringshaw tdawsonenginumichedu wrote  concerning the proposed newsgroup split i personally am not in favor of  doing this  i learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading  this group from code to hardware to algorithms  i just think making 0  different groups out of this is a wate and will only result in a few posts  a week per group  i kind of like the convenience of having one big forum  for discussing all aspects of graphics  anyone else feel this way  just curious  yes i also like knowing where to go to ask a question without getting hell for putting it in the wrong newsgroup  i am also against splitting the group the traffic will decrease on any given subject but the required net bandwidth will increase because of multiply crosspostings  i just went through this with another group i continuously read it is now almost at the point where it is no longer worth reading  strongly suggest not doing this  dave rogers  
  i have some color gifs which i would like to archive in a much smaller size using a grayscale palette of 00 shades the quantization to 00 grays introduces some ugly bands in the pictures which can be nicely eliminated by dithering up to now i have used xv to process the images but now i would like to automate the procedure  the problem is that xv cant i think convert images automatically and the obvious alternative pnmplus ppmquant and pnmdither dont even get close to xvs quality pnmdither apparently dithers in rgb even though the images are in grayscale the dithering routine in xv seems to use the natural image colors for the dither is this or any similar routine available in the public domain if so where     niclas mattsson exjob00mathchalmersse

  i have a question about recursive backward raytracing  when an incident ray i strikes an object at point p first the normal n is calculated light rays are calculated l0 to ln  where n is the number of light sources  these being the light rays that do not intersect with anything the reflected ray r and the transmitted ray t is calculated from the formulae  calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colours  along the rays r and t as rcol and tcol each object has its own colour ocol and each light source has licol 0  i  n  the question is    how do you combine rcol tcol ocol and all the licols to get   the correct resulting colour to return along the i ray  all colours are defined as strucures records having r g b components between 0 and 0  if anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints   adrian secchia  asecchiacsuctacza

    does anyone know of software that will allow you to convert coreldraw cdr files containing bitmaps to scodal as this is the only format our bureaus filmrecorder recognises  corel draw will do it version 0 onwards if you have version 0 perhaps an upgrade is in order  another alternative would be to use a different bureau that can take postscript   chris lilley  technical author itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit manchester computing centre oxford road  manchester uk  m00 0pl                        internet cclilleymccacuk  voice 00 000 000 0000  fax 00 000 000 0000 janet cclilleyukacmcc

    recent discussion about xvs problems were held in some newsgroup here is some text users of xv might find interesting  i have also minor ideas for 00bit xv email me for them  deleted for space basically complaints that xv is an 0 bit program and that making several modifications to the rgb sliders is slow because of screen updates  in reverse order  0 try clicking in the autoapply box to switch it off then make your mods then click on apply there is no problem as stated it has already been solved if you look carefully  0 yes xv is an 0 bit program this is not a bug you can edit individual pallette entries or do global colour changes crop scale etc clearly the program must save out the altered image else all your work would be thrown away so yes it saves out 0 bit images  of course  xv can import 00 bit images and quantises them down to 0 bits this is a handy facility not a bug  how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 00 bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated  if you want to do colour editing on a 00 bit image you need much more powerfull software  which is readily available commercially  and lastly jpeg is a compression algorithm it can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth again this is not a bug it is a way of saving disk space   later   chris lilley  technical author itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit manchester computing centre oxford road  manchester uk  m00 0pl                        internet cclilleymccacuk  voice 00 000 000 0000  fax 00 000 000 0000 janet cclilleyukacmcc

    yes i am aware coreldraw exports in scodal version 0 did it quite well apart from a few hassles with radial fills version 0 revb is better but if you try to export in scodal with a bitmap image included in the drawing it will say something like cannot export scodal with bitmap at least it does on my version  oh ok then sorry for misunderstanding   if anyone out there knows a way around this i am all ears  temporal images make a product called filmpak which converts autocad plots to scodal postscript to scodal and now gif to scodal but it costs 000 and i was just wondering if there was anything out there that just did the bitmap to scodal part a tad cheaper  maybee you should persuade your burea that for only 000 they can become much more competitive taking input from autocad postscript andgif as well as scodl   seriously this sounds like something the bureau should have or find another bureau you should not be the one buting this software   chris lilley  technical author itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit manchester computing centre oxford road  manchester uk  m00 0pl                        internet cclilleymccacuk  voice 00 000 000 0000  fax 00 000 000 0000 janet cclilleyukacmcc

   the sane writes  i was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a 00bit graphics computerimage processing system  i seem to remember it being called image or something akin to that  anyway he claimed it had 00bit color  a 00bit alpha channel  thats 00 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  specifically the 00bit color  thats 000 trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  is this an antialiasing thing  or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor  well 00 bit colour could be for improved resolution but 00 bits per channel seems like a bit excessive i have seen a paper that quoted 00 bits per channel of 00 bits for computational precision more than that would seem to be wasted  perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range  rgb is a cube so it is a compact encoding  most likely however is that there are two separate 00 bit 0 bits per component frame buffers this set up called double buffering allows a complex 0d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer containing the previous frame is displayed this makes for smoother animation  sadly i have access to none of them  just a dec 000000  sigh  well hey if you want to brag about numbers the 0000 range can take a pxg turbo card with 00 bits per pixel full double buffering two 00 bit buffers a 00 bit z buffer and an extra 00 bit buffer for off screen image storage  mind you the card costs more than your workstation   chris lilley  technical author itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit manchester computing centre oxford road  manchester uk  m00 0pl                        internet cclilleymccacuk  voice 00 000 000 0000  fax 00 000 000 0000 janet cclilleyukacmcc

   anyone who thinks that tiff is too complex hasnt dealt with cgm asn0 cda dca sgml or any one of a number of other very successful file format  people seem perfectly capable dealing with these others  dealing with the format of tiff is frankly less difficult than dealing with the dct lzw and fax encoding of the image data  the majority of the libraries which deal with tiff are dedicated to these other issues rather than with simply decoding the tags and parameters  perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather simpleminded formats such as gif pcx and bmp but to suggest that tiff is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous  that doesnt mean that gif isnt fine but dont even thing about using it in many instances  gif is very nice for use in lowend photos applications and for screen grabs and such but it would never do for highvolume or highresolution systems  fax is nice but it doesnt do color and gif doesnt do bw all that well jpeg is nice for highresolution color but is slow for lowend  the advantage tiff brings to the table is its ability to handle all these situations and then some  naturally its more complex but ild rather propose tiff imaging solutions over imaging systems based on having to deal with 00 file formats anyday  you may find that tiff is too complicated for your personal tastes but please dont wrail against its complexity  the complexity it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and doesnt come close to the complexity found in most commercially viable file formats   if were in philosophical arguments against complexity lets all go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length encoding

from us as well   as a huge usercontributed library    feature description    hips  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research   system  development  and  teaching it  handles  sequences  of  images   movies  in precisely the same manner as single frames    programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations filtering convolution fourier and other transform   processing edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation digital   image compression and transmission  methods noise generation and image   statistics computation over 000 such  image transformation programs   have been developed  as a result almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently additionally hips allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines   new users   become effective using hips on their first day    hips features images that are  selfdocumenting   each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image   hips includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of unix   filters  it comes complete with source  code  online manual   pages and online documentation    host configuration requirements    originally  developed at  new  york  university  hips  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available  it runs under the unix operating   system  it is modular  and  flexible provides automatic documentation   of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment   hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and   microvax sun apollo  masscomp  ncr tower iris ibm at etc   for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and   adage ikonas image processors and the sun0 sun0 sun 0 and   sun000i consoles  we also  supply  usercontributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and

adapted for other  image  display devices   because 00 of hips is machine independent    availability    hips has proven itself a highly flexible  system  both as  an   interactive  research tool and for more production oriented tasks it   is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses hips   is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format either reel toreel or   sun  cartridge

working   for alex goetz  you might try contacting them if you already have idl   or would be willing to buy it  its a few thousand dollars american i   expect for idl and the other should be free  those are the general   purpose packages ive heard of besides what terramar has   sips was written for aviris imagery  im not sure how general purpose   it is  you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask  i   have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification you can compute an image using selected components  ive   used it on 00 megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best   speed you need an external dsp card  it will work without it but large   images take quite a while 0000 times as long to process  thats a   freebie if you want it    my  favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems   inc  idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its   programming language is very strong and easy  very pascallike it   handles the numbercrunching very well also personally i like doing   the numbercrunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even   excel on the mac if its not too hairy then bringing it over to nih   image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldnt handle and the speed and ease of use   compared to iraf was incredible by the way its mostly astronomical   image processing which ive been doing this means image enhancement   cleaning up bad linespixels and some other traditional image   processing routines then for example taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line i choose with the mouse then doing a curve   fit to that line which i might do like in kaleidagraph    for idl call research systems  for pvwave call precision visuals and  for sips call university of colorado  boulder  from what i can  understand you can get packaged

applications   host configuration requirements    it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun   though there  were rumors there are always rumors that the software   would be  ported to pc and possibly a sun environment  pci    a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes   an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i   forget  the software is available in versions for msdos unix   workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly   other platforms by now  i use the vms version    the pci software consists of several classesgroupspackages of   utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci   database disk file  the tape io package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape   formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file   this is the only package i use or know much about  other packages can   display data from the pci database to one or another of several   pcisupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer eg an epsontype   dotmatrix graphics printer  you might be more spe cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and   fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg   multiply channel 0 by 0 add channel 0 and store as channel 0 and   god only knows what all else  theres a lot  i dont have and dont   use these so cant say much about them you only buy the packages your   particular applicationinterest calls for    each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from   a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default   directory  some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations  the standard pci environment contains a   scripting language very similar to ibmpc basic but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  in vms i can also   invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure  theres   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the pci   data structures database file parameter file    the pci software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but   requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the   level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well  for instance the tape io package offers a   utility for reading headerless multiband what adobe photoshop on the   macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different   interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphicarts industrys ct0t format would probably i havent tried   handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what   youre doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start   over  its worth noting that the pci database file is designed to   contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of   other information i observe that a remotesensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude   longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this   can go into the pci database    i believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  on vax   systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific   thirdparty display systems the name goulddeanza seems to come to   mind  one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vctq qbus   00bit directcolor display subsystem  pci software could be overkill   in your case it seems designed for the very high end   applicationsusers ie those for whom a macpc largely doesnt suffice   although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  its   probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which   does a lot of its landresource management via remote sensing i believe   the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these   areas  spam spectral analysis manager    back in 0000 jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis   manager which got a fair amount of use at the time  that was designed   for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data  000 pixels   across by  000 lines by  000 bands a modified version has since   been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging   spectrometer which uses much larger images    spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and   ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays   actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   stretching  spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering    the original spam uses x or sunview to display  the aviris version may   require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame   buffer  i can refer you to people if youre interested  pcw requires x   for display  map ii    among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley  clrview    clrview is a

  im asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in zbuffering that ive encountered in 0 different pex implementations  i cant find any discussion of this problem in any resources i can lay hands on eg the compwindowsxpex faq gaskinss pexlibprogrammingmanual vendors documentation  im posting this article by itself on compgraphics and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on compwindowsxpex  the problem is hard to describe without pictures hence this article is longish  if you can run pexlib 0x programs and are interested i encourage you to build and run the test program in compwindowsxpex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it  it depends on the utility code from the above gaskins book instructions for fetching it via anonymous ftp are given  the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching artifacts resulting from the use of zbuffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas  the interpolated z values along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area  because of this its a tossup whether the zbuffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed visually the result tends to be a dashedline effect even though the line is supposed to be solid  using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one for the areas and one for the lines  the pex structures or immediate mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines  the result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines  this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards ie smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas  this means that when a point is transformed to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias  i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the zbuffer typically from 0 to 00000 if not 00000000 ie 00 or 00 bit zbuffers therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching  but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0000 to 0000 of the range  empirically its worst when the npc z component of the slope of the surface is high ie when it appears more or less edgeon to the viewer  its as if only 0 or 0 bits of the zbuffer have any dependable meaning  this amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through areas which they are supposed to lie behind  ive observed the problem on both hewlettpackard and digital workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree  the test program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 0x implementation this version is known to compile and run on an hpux system with pex 00  open questions     0 why does this happen           am i configuring the pex view table wrongly           is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines             as opposed to areas eg pixel centers versus corners which             could be corrected for           are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their             interpolators           something else     0 what to do about it           can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision             in zbuffered hlhsr           is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching             artifacts           am i just out of luck  any help would be immensely appreciated     dave gorgen                         internet gorgenannarborappliconslbcom applicon inc                                 gorgenaaaca0sinetslbcom ann arbor michigan usa               uucp uunetsharkeyapplgagorgen  
   now i have a couple raytracing questions just so you know im using povray 00 both msdos and unix and im generating targa files of varying size  0 ok so i can view these wonderful pictures on my screen  whats the best way  to get them on to paper  would it be possible to take it to kinkos and have   them make an actual picture on paper from it  0 i was thinking about making a small animation bit with different raytraced  frames  is this a bad idea  any tricks to it  0    how would i get a sequence of targa files made into an animation  that i could put on a videotape  is there a cheap way  
   could somebody please email me some info on either what gif or iff file formats are or where i can get such info   thanx  rtarazwpiwpiedu

   hello i have some problem in converting tga filegenerated by povray to rle file when i convert i do not get any warning message but if i use xloadimagegetx00 something is wrong  edited  i know that i need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm but i do not spend time to install them even i do not want to generate rgb from povray and then convert them to rle if possiblergb to rle works but it will mess up my directory with so many files and it needs 0 more steps to finally convert to rle file say cat  rawtorle  rleflip  does any body out there have same experienceproblems    well for starters why use rle files  you might have a specific program that needs them ok but i tend to convert straight to jpeg format thus a 00meg 00bit targa file becomes a 00k or less 00bit jpeg  the latest versions of xv 000  and xloadimage 000 both handle jpeg files and the best way to convert to jpeg is with the cdjpeg suit  even at 00 quality you cant see the difference the jpeg is way smaller than anything else even an 0bit gif  laterish craig        i didnt do it nobody saw me do it            you cant prove anything                        craighumphreystargateactrixgennz ccccccccchumphrecompvuwacnz

   i saw an imaging program some time ago on an amiga that had cross sobel and roberts filters for edge detection   can anybody direct me to these algorithms  ok never heard of cross filters but roberts prewitt and sobel filters are standard spatial masks for edge detection  highpass filtering does a good job of detecting edges too  a good reference for all sorts of general digital image processing is the book digital image processing by rafael c gonzalez and richard e woods  addisonwesley publishing co 0000 isbn 0000000000  ive used this source to do the above filters and many other things as a grad project  not too dificult to do  the worst part is loading in the images from tiffgififfilbmwhatever    wayne rigby rigbycsunredu  
  greetings this is a general call for information regarding image processing i am looking for any material related to the field and am also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the field in particular source code for general use packages  i already have several texts on the subject but would appreciate more input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself im not mathematically literate ie i dont have a degree in mathematics so any material that is suggested i would prefer that it was not mathematically intensive  the best book i have found on the subject at the moment is  practical digital image processing by rhys lewis isbn 0000000000 published by ellis horwood c0000  likewise i am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate image processing techniques so far i have xv and khoros for unix dcview 00 for the ibm pc and various related smatterings of c code to help describe topics like contrasting dithering image enhancement via convolution etc  if anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software pertinent to this area or better still if they could tell me where i am most likely to find it on the aarnet internet if i can i would prefer source code in c or turbo pascal that includes some image processing codealgorithms that i can readily altermanipulate for the purposes of demonstration it would be most helpful  all the above information will contribute to my postgraduate studies and will be liberally used in my paper and seminar on the subject             thanks in advance vance ashlin           diploma advanced computing   thinking is dangerous subversive mindnumbing and leads you astray  ashlinironbarkucnveduau i000000redgumucnveduau

tests     first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic the movie i had been using only had 00 frames in it it was a    version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor    i decided something a little longer would give closer to realworld results    for better or for worse     i pulled out a copy of 0000 a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv    a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie theres a sequence where    the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized    a portion of about 00 seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space    station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only    0 frames per second to give a total of 000 frames     i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 000000 pixels with the spigot    card in my centris 000 quartersize resolution from a pal source i then    imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor    keeping the 0 fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled    to 000000 resolution the other at 000000 resolution i used the default    000 quality setting in premiere 000 and specified a key frame every ten    frames     i then ran the 000000 movie through the same raw speed test program i used    for the results id been reporting earlier     result a playback rate of over 00 frames per second     thats right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie just for fun i copied the 000000 movie to my external hard    disk a quantum lp000s and ran it from there this time the playback rate    was only about 00 frames per second obviously the 000mb internal hard disk    also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback     i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors and tried playing back the 000000 movie scaled to 000000    size this time the playback speed was over 00 fps clearly the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 00 in    action not 00 id try my tests with quicktime 00 but i dont think its    entirely compatible with my centris and system 00     unscaled the playback rate for the 000000 movie was over 000 fps     the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 000000 movie with    preferred playback rates greater than 00 and seeing how well they played    from within movieplayer ie with quicktimes normal synchronized playback    a preferred rate of 00  00 fps didnt work too well the playback was    very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved 00 fps with    ease i cant believe that quicktimes synchronization code would add this    much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac systems task    switching     a preferred rate of 00  00 fps seemed to work fine i couldnt see    any evidence of stutter at 00  00 fps i think i could see slight    stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell     i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also    improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance    even more

zealand    00 00 00 s 000 00 0 e gmt0000   im afraid i missed the start of this thread but there are three factors that can significantly affect quicktimes playback speed that you may want to take into account  0 playback bit depth things are fastest when you play a movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for this is usually 0 or 00 bit but other depths are of course possible  0 type of scaling qt is optimized for double size scaling other scaling factors hit peformance much harder  0 playback window position movieplayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default im not sure about premiere  any combination of those can radically alter playback performance  image size is of course another biggie  giving the movie player lots of ram can also make a real difference  forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread  peter lee      peter e lee software conductor                         specular international inc

  could somebody please email me some info on either what gif or iff file formats are or where i can get such info  well gif stands for graphics interchange format and was put forth by compuserve back in 0000 or so  it was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system  gif is limited to 0 bit color but has a built in compression scheme lzw  iff is not really a graphics format but rather a standard way to package images sounds animations text or whatever into one file  iff was created by electronic arts i do believe i could be wrong for the amiga it was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the amiga the most common image format for the iff package is an ilbm interleaved bitmap but many others exist  this format supports 00 bit color images  information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at zamenhofcsriceedu in the directory pubgraphicsformats taken from the faq for this news group    wayne rigby rigbycsunredu

     david gorgen writes   im asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low  apparent precision in zbuffering that ive encountered in 0 different  pex implementations  i cant find any discussion of this problem in any  resources i can lay hands on eg the compwindowsxpex faq gaskinss  pexlibprogrammingmanual vendors documentation      the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching  artifacts resulting from the use of zbuffering with polylines that are  coplanar with filled areas  the interpolated z values along a line will  differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values  across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with  vertices of the area  because of this its a tossup whether the  zbuffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed  visually the result tends to be a dashedline effect even though the  line is supposed to be solid   using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly  different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one  for the areas and one for the lines  the pex structures or immediate  mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in  effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines  the  result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to  attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines   this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used  in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards ie  smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view  table entry used for areas  this means that when a point is transformed  to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than  if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias   i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount  to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the zbuffer  typically from 0 to 00000 if not 00000000 ie 00 or 00 bit zbuffers  therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc  between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix  the stitching   but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0000  to 0000 of the range  empirically its worst when the npc z  component of the slope of the surface is high ie when it appears more  or less edgeon to the viewer  its as if only 0 or 0 bits of the  zbuffer have any dependable meaning  this amount is so great that one  problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through  areas which they are supposed to lie behind   ive observed the problem on both hewlettpackard and digital  workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree  the test  program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 0x implementation  this version is known to compile and run on an hpux system with pex  00   open questions      0 why does this happen            am i configuring the pex view table wrongly            is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines              as opposed to areas eg pixel centers versus corners which              could be corrected for            are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their              interpolators            something else      0 what to do about it            can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision              in zbuffered hlhsr            is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching              artifacts            am i just out of luck   we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstations  i was also shocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 00 bits assuming 00 bit z buffer  this seems huge but is only 0000 of the dynamic range  in those terms it doesnt seem so bad  what is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear due mainly to roundoff i believe  so the polygon is not planar in z but is more like a ruffles potato chip  ditto with lines  when you startend at different xy values the ridges are out of phase resulting in the stitch effect  you have the same problem if you try to draw 0 polygon right on top of another but with different vertices  you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap   example   try polygon 0 000000000 000000000 000000000 000000000       polygon 0 000000000 000000000 000000000 000000000  your implementation is correct  in fact we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons  such as nurbs surfaces with isoparametric lines  without the trick the lines appear stitched as you say  when the application draws linespolygons independently the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting so the application must do it  this is what you have discovered and are doing bravo  note to ibmers  the information given here has been

  im looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound what i want to do is the following  from a fast source eg a cdrom several sound sources are read each having its own defined position and other attributes eg direction etc  given the listeners position and direction the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction  this means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to its incoming direction have to be done for each sound source  i think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle  this impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source  this impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation  additionally some reflection diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation kinda like some radiosity algorithm    have someone done this andor written articles on implementing such a system   please post or mail any answers or comments    torgeir veimo  studying at the university of bergen  im gona wave my freak flag high jimi hendrix  and it would be okay on any other day the police

  does this mean they can either do alpha or stenciling but not both simultaneously  i dont know the answer the to this one although with 0bits i would assume that it was one or the other    stereo supportyesyes  otherboth machines will double buffer or do                                                                    stereo output per window  both have an  auxiliary video output that is rs000a  ntsc and pal same question again does this mean they can either do double buffering or stereo but not both simultaneously  according to the literature it will do quadruple buffering so that you can have double buffered stereo output  brian

  i am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing 0d interactive applications what types of 0d widgets you would like to have in your applications    a 0d widget is usually located in the same scene as other 0d objects of the  application  it may let you   manipulate application data the camera   0d objects in the scene and so on or  view the status of the application or 0d objects   via the widgets shape color position orientation and so on or  do whatever i missed but you think is possible  for example a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball shown as a partially transparent sphere superimposed on the object to be rotated a feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 0 objects  the length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance  a widget can provide both manipulation and feedback  for example the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis   please email me or post your opinions on 0d interaction  the information i gathered will help me design a 0d ui construction tool your help is very much appreciated  tony lau tlaucsubcca msc student dept of computer science

  in article 0rguqoinnrcednaccswineduau alansaturncsswinozau alan christiansen writes i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave  self intersecting polygons  this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that  simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line complex figure 0 type polygons can be a bit trickier  it is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concavemulti outline algorithm but not tremendously faster  i spent awhile implementing and optimizing both flavors and the convex turned out about 00 faster  this is all c on hp parisc the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as fast as possible as far as i could tell  for any sort of game the database to render is known ahead of time and can be made all convex  definitely the way to go   ok thanks for help everyone i still havent found quite what im looking for but ive got finals coming up soon so i have to put all this on hold thanx   lucas

   more people have been asking for information on the kubota graphics workstations so here is some more info on the kenaidenali vs the es freedom   here is the text of a denali vs es freedom done by dh brown associates    denali bears a strong resemblance to evans and sutherlands freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its highlevel design  both products use a parallel array of 00000 processors for geometric computations  both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors  as a result denali and freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality  both design teams also appear to have  similar philosophies with respect to modularity scalability and market penetration  there remain however several important differences between the kpc and es products  evans and sutherland designed freedom as a highend developers dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility  in its favor freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than denali  all freedom systems include a large fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions  the freedom design treats its entire image memory as generalpurpose memory allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of specialpurpose applications  finally es provided freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications  note that kpc is working an auxiliary board for ntsc and pal output that will not require an external video encoder  es programmable output features however will remain much more flexible  the kpc design team in contrast made denali more of an endusers system entry version have better performance range and flexibility than lowend freedom configurations and come in at more realistic mainstream price points  denali does not need as many 00000 modules as freedome because it uses a deeper scanconversion pipeline to support each one resulting in better costperformance characteristics  although both products provide strong support for 0d imaging and volume rendering kpc recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities  denalis configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately and to upgrade them separately as needed  both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack sgis more expensive vgxt and realityengine systems  the only other products to provide this capability  kpc supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy trilinear interpolated mipmapping method  on balance however denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than es for most applications aside from being much more affordable kpc solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more offscreen memory for general graphics data storage  by implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules es foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance  kubota avoids this problem by linking texturing to its frame buffer modules providing a lowercost more scalable solution  hope this helps  brian  ps this was reprinted without permission  for the full text please contact kubota 0000000000

  cclilleymccacuk writes  in article 0rohjcavtcctutfi jk00000lehtoricctutfi kouhia juhana writes  i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 0bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 00bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images  doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to 00bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations  think about what you are saying here the 00 bit image is quantised down to 0 bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the 00 bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour  i suppose you dont know what about we have discussed we discussed about errors in xv 000 which shows images only as 0bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it  so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv  that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didnt tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place  gamma and color corrections are easily done to 00bit image as i presented theres no need make tricks from 0bitquantized image back to 00 bit image   how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 00 bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated  ok youre writing about situation that user want edit images as 00bit and user want edit individual colors  your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit  my solution doesnt work because theres no colormap withing real 00bit image  you see user see 00bit image going back to 0bit is silly   about changing individual colors in 0bitquantizedrasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized  small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image xv allows this feature but i dont recommend to use it with the mentioned type images  moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes in full 00bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have 0bit screen theres need for tricks to get the original 00bit image modified because user dont see full 00bit image theres need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be 0x0 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area  selecting individual color is possible from that  ok i dont have thought very much 00bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention 00bit painting program in 0bit screen   yes again what is was wrong with xv  it saved 0bitquantizedrasterized images as 00bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that also human expect that 00bit will be saved as 00bit image say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work  design error  i have heard xv were designed first for 0bit imagesfiles but it were not good idea to take full 00bit images without making major change to the original design  so even all screen images are 0bit the processed images and saved images could have been 00bit very easily instead of 0bit  before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals  however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesnt solve the problem americans the lift is just an example    well my text may be a bit hard reading hopefully you suggeeded to read it   juhana kouhia

  anyone who thinks that tiff is too complex hasnt dealt with cgm asn0 cda dca sgml or any one of a number of other very successful file format  people seem perfectly capable dealing with these others  well yeah but unlike tiff they all do substantially more than encode rectangular bitmaps  and the others are hardly trouble free  i hear that it is quite common for cgm implementations not to interoperate  the annoying thing about tiff is that is that along with the 00 useful options there are 000 stupid options  the most egregious example is that rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently in all tiff files byte and bit order are options and all tiff readers on all machines no matter what their natural byte order have to be prepared to do byte swapping  there are four slightly different fax formats  again any one of them would have been adequate  rgb images can be stored by pixel or by component complexity without function etc etc  i also note that the tiff doc says that aldus experiments show that lzw reliably compresses as well or better than any of the fax formats suggesting that none of the fax formats are really useful  whats worse a lot of the formats arent even implemented very well eg lzw limits code words to 00 bits while 00 or 00 bits would have provided substantially better compression  and the lzw method compresses bytes rather than pixels  but the absolute worst thing about tiff is that any vendor can register proprietary tiff codes and formats without even publicly documenting them this means that there is no way to write a tiff reader that can reliably read all incoming tiff files  some standard  regards john levine johnliecccambridgemaus spdccimaworldieccjohnl

    could someone explain the difference between tom gaskins two books      o  pexlib programming manual    o  phigs programming manual    why would i want to buy one book vs the other book  i have an 00000  pexlib and phigs as it comes from mit with pex and as is explained in the phigs programming manual are just different apis for the pex protocol which is an extension to the x protocol  so it depends on you what you go to use  advantage of phigs is the protability to other platforms ibm graphigs  sunphigs and the standardized structuring of the 0d objects  advantage of pexlib is the sometimes faster and easier programming for immediate mode graphics because pex is not an exactly mapping of phigs to a prortocol                  o o  oooooo       roland holzapfel       computer     email                          wilhelminenstrasse 0   graphics       holzapfeigdfhgde          0000 darmstadt          center      phone                         germany                 zgdv        00 0000 000000                         this space intentionally left blank                     
   vamilliron  yes intels pci is another local bus standard which can be used for graphics although i believe local buses can be used for other things too  as far as i know though pci local bus  would compete with vesa local bus not the vesa graphics standard but others more enlightened might be able to shed more light on this matter  
   i need a graphics display program that can take as a parameter the name of the file to be displayed then just display that image and then quit  all of the other graphics display programs come up with a menu first or some other silliness  this program is going to be run from within another program  i have lots of memory and vga color  any graphics format will do  has anyone heard of such a beast  keith   keith knudsen notre dame in

  please help  i have an ibmcompatible notebook computer with an lcd vga screen  while i was working with it this morning the screen started to flicker a little which i thought was odd since i do use a surgeprotector for my computer and all peripherals  it only did this for a second and then stopped  i left the room for several minutes and when i returned the screen was completely dim not blank but very very dim  the contrast slider still worked so that i could adjust it to where i could faintly make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely no effect  i was pluggedin at the time ie not using the battery but i still tried switching the battery changing the powersaver features etc etc all to no avail  has anyone else experienced anything like this  if this just means that i need to replace the screen then i guess ill have to but i thought that the death of my lcd screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened  i didnt want to take it in to be repaired before i asked on the net about this because i already know what theyll say yep you gotta have this replaced and its gonna cost you   ive only had the computer for about 00 months  is that a reasonable life cycle for a lcd display  oh i guess i ought to give specifics here the brand is compudyne is this a reputable company its a 000sx  00 mhz i forget the model number exactly and i was too ticked off to write it down before coming in to work today  if anyone can help me please give me any advice you might have  im not opposed to having it replaced but id rather not if its not absolutely necessary  if you wouldnt mind please email me at mikemikukyedu but if youd rather post ill be checking back here in a couple of days  btw if the answer to this question is already in a faq somewhere feel free to flame away but i would ask that you also include the location and name of the faq if you dont mind  thanks in advance for any help  mike mattone mikemikukyedu    
  whats really interesting is that from what i can tell the mis folks in the basement with their es0000 dont seem to be pissed at ibm why  i have no idea  either ibm really does take care of their customers better or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the smaller vendors do  no mis folks have infinite budgets of death and they also get parts of their budget allocated upgrades maintenance and new purchases and a lot of ibm mainframe purchases are actually leases and so is the software  basically the engineers who have tight budgets ie the coders and designers of a company bitch and moan when they drop 00000 on a  sparc 0 only to see a faster machine appear a year later  mis types upgrade once every 000 years and their costs are amortized and depreciated over a longer period and the budget office justifies the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting payroll etc  now if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some reason like payroll and accounts youd sure as hell see every engineer with a new cray on his desktop every year   brian

    in article 0000apr0000000000000nessiemccacuk cclilleymccacuk writes  in article 0rohjcavtcctutfi jk00000lehtoricctutfi kouhia juhana writes  i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 0bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 00bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images  doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to 00bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations  think about what you are saying here the 00 bit image is quantised down to 0 bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the 00 bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour  i suppose you dont know what about we have discussed we discussed about errors in xv 000 which shows images only as 0bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it  look be consistent first you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an 0 bit program as some sort of error  so i post and asy it is not a bug it is meant to be like that  so you post and say it is not a bug you never said it was i have misunderstood etc now you are saying  we discussed about errors in xv 000 which shows images only as 0bit  if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a lot easier    so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv  that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didnt tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place  eh sorry i dont understand what you are saying here i am aware that english is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning but this paragraph defeats me  gamma and color corrections are easily done to 00bit image as i presented theres no need make tricks from 0bitquantized image back to 00 bit image  yes as i originally said global changes are easily possible  but this statement contradicts what you said earlier   i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 0bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 00bit image    how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 00 bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated  ok youre writing about situation that user want edit images as 00bit and user want edit individual colors  your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit  no i dont think so actually   you were talking about loading a 00 bit image into xv by quantising manipulating the colours in the colour editor then somewhow applying these changes to the 00 bit file when you exit xv xv lets you edit individual colours where is this sudden jumping off the topic  my solution doesnt work because theres no colormap withing real 00bit image   yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a 00 bit file   you see user see 00bit image going back to 0bit is silly  i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean  about changing individual colors in 0bitquantizedrasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized  small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image   what are you saying   xv allows this feature but i dont recommend to use it with the mentioned type images  ah now we see thew problem first you want to extend xv to allow editing of 0 bit previews of 00 bit images then i point out problems with this now you are saying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem   moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes   not sure what you are saying here certainly one can make local changes  in full 00bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have 0bit screen theres need for tricks to get the original 00bit image modified because user dont see full 00bit image theres need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be 0x0 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area  selecting individual color is possible from that  yes that is one possible approach i would find a program that took such an approach clumsy however  ok i dont have thought very much 00bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention 00bit painting program in 0bit screen  well here we agree  you have not thought it through very much you dont seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next ok we all have off days  perhaps you should step back and think this one through  yes again what is was wrong with xv  it saved 0bitquantizedrasterized images as 00bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that  as i said in the last post jpeg is a compression algorithm it is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression i fail to see what the problem is you have not proposed any workable alternatives  also human expect that 00bit will be saved as 00bit image   speak for yourself you are the only person i have met or spoken to who having quantised a 00 bit image down to 0 bits expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 0 bit image palette  perhaps that is why you yused the singular  say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same   look next time you import a 00 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel  it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 0 bit image xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 00 bit file you are the only person who claims this is confusing  so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work  design error  is a design error the same as a bug   read my lips xv is a program for viewing and modifying 0 bit images it lets you import other images it shows i would say a good deal of thought about the human interface and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for it makes no false claims  i have heard xv were designed first for 0bit imagesfiles but it were not good idea to take full 00bit images without making major change to the original design  if you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post them so  far you have not done so  so even all screen images are 0bit the processed images and saved images could have been 00bit very easily instead of 0bit  argh after all this a comment like that very easily ok go ahead and code it if it is so easy  or alternatively look up the terms import and nonreversible transformation  before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals  however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesnt solve the problem americans the lift is just an example   i think this is a bit of an exageration  what you are actually saying is you got into a lift elevator if you are in the states   and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up everyone else had no problem now you are trying to sue the manufacturer  well my text may be a bit hard reading   you bet  hopefully you suggeeded to read it  mostly leaving aside the language issue however it betrays some very wooly thinking as you yourself admit which is the same in any language go think some

      i am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program    an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on sgi gl    besides typical touchup tasks such as crop rotate smooth etc    bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs    such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image     the following is the relevant sections from the man page       prerelease of may 0000                                       bit0l  name    bit  bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations  description   bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on   silicon graphics gl as a full color program bit handles images of both   00bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner    as an image viewer bit allows list of images to be displayed in their   original type 00bits or color index in any order and in any of the   many builtin styles of display you can walk up and down the list using   mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the   slideshow  with the pan and zoom features large images can be viewed   in full without being limited by the window or screen size    as an image editor bit performs a large number of image editing and   processing tasks accurately and efficiently it keeps information loss   at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing   subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type   whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion andor quantization of   input images you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into   another  in addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple   geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with   the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take   advantage of the higher printer resolutions eg postscript    bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing   image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence   turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be   accessed by a press of a button and best of all the processed image   will be read back and displayed immediately convolution using exter   nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically   giving great flexibility in processing an image  features    bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a   continuous progress report and once the processing is complete    the processed image will be displayed    current features include    o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of antialiasing     and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color    o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x andor ydirections with     the option of subpixel sampling    o renders text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an     image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving     the text and raster separately such as into a postscript file to     take advantage of a higher printer resolution besides normal text     strings many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as     in tex0 eg alphasmallbeta produces greek alphabet alpha     followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta    o presents graphically the histogram of an image    o performs arbitrary 0to0 pixel transformation  the transformation     function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary     forms further the transformation can be applied to rgb channels     separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of     it many difficult tasks such as thresholding can be accomplished     rather easily by 0to0 transformation in combination with the avai     lability of graphical histograms of the image    o places simple geometric figures sgfs eg arrows circles trian     gles etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at     arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some     user definable coordinate system units with the option of rendering     directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately eg     postscript file all sgfs can be scaled in x and ydirections     independently or simultaneously this is how to get an ellipse from a     circle    o performs edge detection in combination with image histograms and 0     to0 transformation very accurate result can be obtained    o performs histogram equalization    o performs convolution with externally defined square matrices of     arbitrary order    o crops a rectangular portion of an image    o cuts and pastes across images    o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount    o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause     interval between images slideshow    o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels     along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities     or as an intensity vs distance plot    o performs image type conversions    o converts image formats    o smoothes an image special convolution    o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image     back and display it    o modify an individual pixels rgb values    o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the     resulting power spectra    o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this prerelease   supported formats       o  iris rgb native to sgi iris       o  jpegjfif format       o  compuserv gif       o  pnmportable any map including ppm pgm and pbm       o  xbm x window bitmap       o  tiff       o  postscriptwrite only  hardware requirements     any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode including

unpacking  acknowledgement     jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groupss library version 0    forms library developed by mark overmars is used for gui    both jpeg and forms library are included in this release     bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate   images the builtin editing features will satisfy most of   your editing needs in addition the external filter and dynamical   kernel will utilize any program you already have so try it   and you will like it      as always any commentsbug reports are welcome

   and no siggraph 00 has not skipped town  were preparing the best siggraph conference yet  speaking of siggraph i just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for siggraph and reupping of membership in the acm last night and was i ever grossed out  the new prices for membership are almost highway robbery  for example  siggraph basic fee went from 00 last year to 00 this year for the same thing a 000 increase  those facile enough to arrange a trip to the annual conference could reduce this to 00 by selecting siggraph lite which means siggraph is charging an additional 00 or so for the proceedings and the art show catalog essentially  toplas went up 00 in cost way outstripping the current inflation rate  basic sigchi fees remainded the same but whereas before sigchi membership included uist and human factors conferences proceedings these are now an extra cost option  bundling that back into the basic rate equivalent services have gone up 000 in cost  sigois membership cost has up 00 but theyve also split out the computer supported cooperative work conference proceedings that used to be included with membership  adding that cost back in means this sig also has doubled its membership fee  what really galls me is that the acm sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services and tried to make it sound like they were offering new services  but with the exception of a couple like siggraph all the plus services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they dont look so big  but their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 00 more than last year for a 00 increase in services measured by cost not by value and curiously a 00 inflation rate on the publications i got last year  is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as i am  robert reedhome animation ltd0000000000 robertslipknotraincom0000 first court west linn or 00000  shooting yourself in the foot in various languages and systems  motif  you spend days writing a uil description of your foot the   trajectory the bullet and the intricate scrollwork on the ivory handles   of the gun when you finally get around to pulling the trigger the gun   jams

     a great many computer programmers read dr dobbs journal  in a recent issue there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read  it said    theres nothing wrong if microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry  the industry needs an ibm for the 00s    where has the hacker ethic gone  not the cracker ethic which is something entirely different and bad but the hacker ethic which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the handson imperative  why is it that people and corporations like bill gates ibm and intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry  why is it that if a person like myself posts messages to usenet on how to get into the little nooks crannies and idiosyncrasies of a computer system they are not given any useful information by those who know just a badmouthing or are completely ignored  why is it that people like steve jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products  i ask those of you who call yourselves hackers why is this  and further how can you let it go on  it is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world and shall continue to do so for a long time to come  it has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago and has made this world even smaller than it was before  i shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way perpetuating more drivel like the 000 windows and the ibm product line on the computerusing public      that is not to say i am against business per se people who profit off of innovative intelligent creative designs do not bother me  in fact i applaud it that is the american way  but those who manage to sell kludgy uncreative systems to the public and profit off of them are the ones who are the problem  and unfortunately because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity they can keep doing it for a very long time    i put it to you thus  where has the hacker ethic gone  if it still exists where  and if it does exist why are those who call themselves hackers allowing this to perpetuate itself  why are they not creating new innovative interesting ideas to stop the sos from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry    i await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence     pstlbacad0alaskaedu       revenge is a dish best served cold          szechuan death                      khan singh                                                                  star trek ii  the wrath of khan

correct email address to reply to      0  what is jpeg  jpeg pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 0bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   0  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 00bitperpixel color data instead of 0bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 0 mbyte fullcolor file down to 000 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 00 bitspixel 00 million colors instead of 0 or less 000 or fewer colors  if you have only 0bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 0bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 0 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   0  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 00bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 0 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 00 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 000 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 0 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 00 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   0  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 000x000 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 0b  file   size in bytescomments  shipppm0000000  original file in ppm format no compression 00 bits  or 0 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead shipppmz 000000  ppm file passed through unix compress  compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note  other textoriented compressors give similar results shipgif 000000  converted to gif with ppmquant fs 000  ppmtogif  most of the savings is the result of losing color  info gif saves 0 bitspixel not 00  see sec 0  shipjpg00 000000  cjpeg q 00    highest useful quality setting  this is indistinguishable from the 00bit original  at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00    default setting  you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this  from the original even with both onscreen at once shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  this has slight defects if you know what to look  for you could tell its been jpeged without seeing  the original  still as good image quality as many  recent postings in usenet pictures groups shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  jpegs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent  at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some  still ive seen plenty of usenet postings that were  of poorer image quality than this shipjpg0o   0000  cjpeg q 0 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead  blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or  indexing purposes  note that this file is tiny  the compression ratio from the original is 0000   in this case jpeg can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 00 file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   0  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 00 does not mean keep 00 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 00 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 00 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 00 saying q 000 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 00 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 00 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 00 is about right for compressing 00bit images but q 00 to 00 is usually better for converting gifs see section 00 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 0 to 00 is about right  q 0 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 0b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   0  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   0a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  xv shareware 00 is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats  it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu 0000000 file contribxv000tarz  version 000 is a major upgrade with support for 00bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking  if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 000 also available from export  note that version 000 is not a good choice if you have a 00bit display youll get only 0bit color nor for converting 00bit images to jpeg  but 000 works fine for converting gif and other 0bit images to jpeg  caution there is a glitch in version 000 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 00bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 000  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage000tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v0 decoder while xloadimage 000 is using a hackedover v0  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli000tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 00bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os0 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 00 is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 000000000 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg00zip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 000 or 000000 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 00 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv00zip  hiview requires a 000 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm000 and 000max work windows and os0 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 00  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview00zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv0zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel00 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 000a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 00  available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw000azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic00 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg0zip or jpeg0000zip if you have a 000 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 0b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif0jpgjpg0gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 00bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 00 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif0jpg0zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy  this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats  it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 000 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsalch000zip  note about simtel00 the internets key archive site for pcrelated programs is simtel00 full name wsmrsimtel00armymil 0000000000  simtel00 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel00 that really means pd0msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel00  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel00 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 00000000000 which keeps simtel00 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel00 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel00 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 00 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 00 and 000ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version 00 is available from ftpcicaindianaedu 000000000 file pubpcwin0desktopjview000zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchivewustledu  winjpeg shareware 00 displays jpeggiftargatiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and slideshow  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows0winjp000zip  this is a slow 000compatible version if you register youll get the 000only version which is roughly 00 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 00  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 000 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin0desktopcview000zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos  dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in fullscreen mode not in a window  os0  the following files are available from hobbesnmsuedu 00000000000 note check pubuploads for more recent versions  the hobbes moderator is not

most mac jpeg programs rely on apples jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a 00000 or better cpu and you need to be running system 000 or later  if youre running system 0 you must also install the 00bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 0  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 0000 this file contains quicktime 00 which is better than qt 00 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 00  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 00 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 00 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 000000 file infomacappjpegview00hqx  requires system 0 and quicktime  on 0bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 000x000 pixels on a typical 0mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 00 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 000  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter000hqx  requires system 000 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert00hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v00 a jpeggif converter based on an old version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt00stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 00bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 0 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 00bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress000hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 00bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 000 or later can read and write jfifformat jpeg files use the jpeg plugin from the acquire menu  you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it  amiga  most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at

if youd like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join   0  whats all this hoopla about color quantization  most people dont have fullcolor 00 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 0 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 000 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 0bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 000orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 000 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 000color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 000 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 000 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 000color gif on a 00color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan0bit display hardware already 00bit hicolor pc displays true 00bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   0  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart00  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   0  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 000 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v0 free jpeg code you can also say sample 0x0 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 00bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 0 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 0 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   00  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 00 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 00 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 0a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 00 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif0jpgjpg0gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   00  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  0  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d0 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 00 followed by jfif  0  if you see ff d0 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  0  hsi files start with hsi0  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  0  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d0 and you should be able to read it  0  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d0     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  begin line mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  begin line mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   00  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 0 or 00 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   00  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 00 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    00  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 0 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 000 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 00 or 00rd the size of the gif file not 00th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 00 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 00 to 00 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 000 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v0 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 00 or so when converting gifs values of 00 to 00 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 00 smooth 00 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg group at jpeginfouunetuunet    tom lane organizer independent

  im having a slight problem with the pov raytracer  im not sure if this is the correct group to post to or not  i create tga files on a unix machine using pov  then when i download them to display on my pc theyre listed as bad files  but when i create the file on my pc it displays fine  are unix tgas incompatible with the pc  an easy solution to this problem would be a unix targagif converter  anyone know where i could find one  any help on this subject is appreciated     kevin

     can someone who knows what theyre talking about add a faq entry  on gamma correction  thanks  i get regular questions about gamma correction since i go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli the image loader program i maintain  here is an explanation i often use to answer these questions  this might be suitable for inclusion in the faq  graeme gill   a note on gamma correction and images  author graeme w gill         graemelabtamozau  date 00000   what is all this gamma stuff anyway    although it would be nice to think that an image is an image there are a lot of complications not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats gif jpeg tiff etc etc there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated gamma is one of those things if youve ever downloaded images from bbs or the net youve probably noticed with most image viewing programs that some images look ok some look too dark and some look too light why is this  you may ask this is gamma correction or the lack of it  why do we need gamma correction at all    gamma correction is needed because of the nature of crts cathode ray tubes  the monitors usually used for viewing images if you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene then you have created a linear or ungammacorrected image this is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light ie adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a crt you find that the crt doesnt give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage the amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this  lightout  voltage  crtgamma  so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a crt the image will look much too dark to fix this up you have to gamma correct the image first you need to do the opposite of what the crt will do to the image so that things cancel out and you get what you want so you have to do this to your image  gammacorrectedimage  image  0crtgamma  for most crts the crtgamma is somewhere between 00 and 00  if that is all it is why does it seem so complicated    the problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction also not all sources of images give you linear images video cameras or video signals in general because of this a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them and you are  rarely sure how much if you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light if you display one of those images with a program that doesnt do gamma correction then it will look vaguely right but not perfect because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular crt  whose fault is all this    it is really three things one is all those display programs out there that dont do gamma correction properly another is that most image formats dont specify a standard gamma or dont have some way or recording what their gamma correction is the third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about and create a lot of images with varying gammas  at least two file formats do the right thing the utah graphics toolkit rle format has a semistandard way of recording the gamma of an image the jfif file standard that uses jpeg compression specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 00 ie a linear image  but not everyone obeys the rules  some image loaders for instance xli  an x00 image utility allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view other image viewers eg xv another x00 image program and utilities eg the pbm toolkit provide ways of changing the gamma of an image but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has and then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt monitor   note that xv 000 doesnt provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image you need to adjust the r g and b curves to the appropriate gamma in the coledit controls altering the intensity in the hsv controls doesnt do the right thing as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on h and s this tends to give a tint to the image   how can i figure out what my viewer does or what gamma my screen has    the simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgammajpg provided with xli distribution which is a jfif jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps the ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye one using continuous tones and the other using dithering  if your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images then the two ramps should look symmetrical and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom to find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen and defocus your eyes a bit  if your viewer doesnt do gamma correction then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part and the point of equal brightness will be above the center  if your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma and decrease it if it is below the center the value will usually be around 00   with xli for instance you can adjust the display gamma with the dispgamma flag and once youve got it right you can set the displaygamma environment variable in your profile  how do i figure out what the gamma of an image is    this is the most tricky bit as a general rule it seems that a lot of true color ie 00 bit ppm jpg images have a gamma of 00 linear although there are many about that have some gamma correction it seems that the majority of pseudo color images ie 0 bit images with color maps  gif etc are gamma corrected to some degree or other  if your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good and gamma corrected images will look too light  if your viewer doesnt do gamma correction then linear images will look too dark and gamma corrected images will ok  why linear images are sometimes not such a good thing   one of the reason that many high quality formats such as video use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium this is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic this means images  could make better use of 0 bits per color for instance if they used gamma correction the implication though is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 0 bit image to 00 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy since little popular software does this and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level  if some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing  i am told that the kodak photocd format for instance has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image

photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 0bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   0  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 00bitperpixel color data instead of 0bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 0 mbyte fullcolor file down to 000 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 00 bitspixel 00 million colors instead of 0 or less 000 or fewer colors  if you have only 0bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 0bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 0 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   0  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 00bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 0 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 00 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 000 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 0 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 00 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   0  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 000x000 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 0b  file   size in bytescomments  shipppm0000000  original file in ppm format no compression 00 bits  or 0 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead shipppmz 000000  ppm file passed through unix compress  compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note  other textoriented compressors give similar results shipgif 000000  converted to gif with ppmquant fs 000  ppmtogif  most of the savings is the result of losing color  info gif saves 0 bitspixel not 00  see sec 0  shipjpg00 000000  cjpeg q 00    highest useful quality setting  this is indistinguishable from the 00bit original  at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00    default setting  you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this  from the original even with both onscreen at once shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  this has slight defects if you know what to look  for you could tell its been jpeged without seeing  the original  still as good image quality as many  recent postings in usenet pictures groups shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  jpegs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent  at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some  still ive seen plenty of usenet postings that were  of poorer image quality than this shipjpg0o   0000  cjpeg q 0 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead  blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or  indexing purposes  note that this file is tiny  the compression ratio from the original is 0000   in this case jpeg can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 00 file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   0  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 00 does not mean keep 00 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 00 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 00 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 00 saying q 000 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 00 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 00 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 00 is about right for compressing 00bit images but q 00 to 00 is usually better for converting gifs see section 00 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 0 to 00 is about right  q 0 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 0b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   0  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   0a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  xv shareware 00 is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats  it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu 0000000 file contribxv000tarz  version 000 is a major upgrade with support for 00bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking  if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 000 also available from export  note that version 000 is not a good choice if you have a 00bit display youll get only 0bit color nor for converting 00bit images to jpeg  but 000 works fine for converting gif and other 0bit images to jpeg  caution there is a glitch in version 000 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 00bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 000  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage000tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v0 decoder while xloadimage 000 is using a hackedover v0  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli000tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 00bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os0 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 00 is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 000000000 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg00zip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 000 or 000000 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 00 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv00zip  hiview requires a 000 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm000 and 000max work windows and os0 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 00  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview00zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv0zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel00 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 000a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 00  available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw000azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic00 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg0zip or jpeg0000zip if you have a 000 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 0b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif0jpgjpg0gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 00bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 00 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif0jpg0zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy  this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats  it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 000 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsalch000zip  note about simtel00 the internets key archive site for pcrelated programs is simtel00 full name wsmrsimtel00armymil 0000000000  simtel00 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel00 that really means pd0msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel00  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel00 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 00000000000 which keeps simtel00 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel00 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel00 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 00 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 00 and 000ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version 00 is available from ftpcicaindianaedu 000000000 file pubpcwin0desktopjview000zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchivewustledu  winjpeg shareware 00 displays jpeggiftargatiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and slideshow  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows0winjp000zip  this is a slow 000compatible version if you register youll get the 000only version which is roughly 00 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 00  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 000 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin0desktopcview000zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos  dvpeg see dos heading also works under

jpeg programs rely on apples jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a 00000 or better cpu and you need to be running system 000 or later  if youre running system 0 you must also install the 00bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 0  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 0000 this file contains quicktime 00 which is better than qt 00 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 00  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 00 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 00 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 000000 file infomacappjpegview00hqx  requires system 0 and quicktime  on 0bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 000x000 pixels on a typical 0mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 00 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 000  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter000hqx  requires system 000 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert00hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v00 a jpeggif converter based on an old version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt00stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 00bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 0 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 00bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress000hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 00bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 000 or later can read and write jfifformat jpeg files use the jpeg plugin from the acquire menu  you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it  amiga  most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at

not support jpeg   portable software for almost any system  if none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in 0b  youll also need a viewer program if your display is 0 bits or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm 00bit image files  there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings with more popping up every day  i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow  in that case purchase a hardwareassisted product  ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the

group is a volunteer organization if youd like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join   0  whats all this hoopla about color quantization  most people dont have fullcolor 00 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 0 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 000 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 0bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 000orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 000 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 000color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 000 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 000 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 000color gif on a 00color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan0bit display hardware already 00bit hicolor pc displays true 00bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   0  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart00  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   0  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 000 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v0 free jpeg code you can also say sample 0x0 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 00bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 0 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 0 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   00  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 00 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 00 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 0a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 00 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif0jpgjpg0gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   00  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  0  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d0 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 00 followed by jfif  0  if you see ff d0 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  0  hsi files start with hsi0  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  0  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d0 and you should be able to read it  0  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d0     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  begin line mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  begin line mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   00  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 0 or 00 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   00  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 00 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    00  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 0 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 000 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 00 or 00rd the size of the gif file not 00th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 00 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 00 to 00 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 000 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v0 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 00 or so when converting gifs values of 00 to 00 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 00 smooth 00 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg group at jpeginfouunetuunet    tom lane organizer independent

  my threed library does a lot of projections  duh  but currently it is projecting an objects vertices on a per triangle basis  this is grossly inefficient for 00 of the objects displayed  which can be optimized by doing projections one time once for each vertex  but objects whose zextents intersect the hither plane cant benefit from this because new vertices must be created during zclipping  anyone have any better ideas  yes  heres what you should do  keep the vertices in an array and have the polygons triangles are okay but nsided polygons are slightly more efficient store the indices into the array of the vertices that comprise them  you set a flag for each vertex when you transform it so you dont have to transform any vertex more than once you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys dont have to be transformed at all  whenever you transform a vertex check if its on the far side of the hither plane if it is you can project it right away and store the result  then do your z clip any vertices that get produced will have to have their projection done at that stage    bernie roehl         university of waterloo dept of electrical and computer engineering mail broehlsuneeuwaterlooca voice  000 0000000 x 0000 work

   in 0d studio is there any way to create refraction diffraction etc   i want to simulate such things as glass lenses bottles etc  there might be an ipas routine that does thatbut i canr be sure  another way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the image  then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection  it will take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection but thats the only thing i can think of  
  greetings all    does anyone use some form of 0d input device  i would like to hear any information on any systems that people are currently using  please email responses i will summarise if i get some feedback   brendan langoulant brendanguuwaeduau

  hi im new to imaging and my advisor and i would like to  do some 0d reconstructions  we take slides biological and image them on a 000  then the software allows us to trace the outline of the objects  we want to save  the outlines are stored as a tiff file  we would like to convert a group of these outlines into a  0d image  we are unsure as to where to begin  someone mentioned that if we could convert the tiff into a vector format then  we could view them in autocad  any help would be greatly appreciated  pankaj oberoi spedheadathenamitedu   
  i recently read in a book that the tiff version 00 specification was due to be released in the spring of 0000  i am interested in finding out about the new features of the tiff spec and if it is out  specifically i need to know if tiff 00 supports vq decompression andor image tiling

  many highend graphics cards come with c source code for doing basic graphics sorts of things change colors draw pointslinespolygonsfills etc  does such a library exist for generic vga graphics cardschips hopefully in the public domain  this would be for the purpose of compiling under a nondos operating system running on a standard pc   im also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library  package to do pc vga graphics    im currently working on a realtime application running on a pcc with a  nondos kernel that needs to do some simple graphics  im not sure if  reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not   i suspect ill implement the display controller as a server process that  handles graphics requests queued on a mailbox one at a time  if this  provides sufficiently frequent display updates then i believe that i can  restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus  constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need for a reentrant graphics library    being fairly new to the realtime systems world i may be overlooking something what do you think  cheers bob fitzsimmonsfitzcseogiedu0000000000

   hello i have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a moderately helpful response on a couple of issues this i appreciated very much  i would however like to know why it is that ther is simply no  information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics programmer the subjects are  0 how do you access the extra video memory on a video board i know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to dothis i have 0meg of memory on my board and according to all the books and info i have read i am only at maximum using 000k of it there is a way to do this in standard vga cause i have seen vidoe paging written in assembly which i dont know written into apps hat use mode 00h to get any speed at all you have to do this how do i do it  0 the vesa standard what gives here i have read most of what the net has to offer on vesa and as far as coding for vesa goes most of the advice is cryptic at best where do i get public domain info that will tell me in mostly plain english how the vesa calls work  my biggest gripe is about number 0 i have bought graphics books i have asked graphics professors i have hunted the net through both gopher and archie i ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is some lock on this information graphics programming books tell alot of programmiing algorithm information but they always fall short of telling you how to really control the video bios what are all the calls folks i know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff where are you and why havent you written a book yet   please help  thanks in advance  stephen palm palmsnycanvabitnet please send all personal replies to the above address thanks

and meyer   in article 0000may000000000000halcom bobphalcom bob pendleton writes      this is getting pretty silly first off hacker is an obsolete term      doesnt matter what it used to mean today it means thief      it only means thief if you want it to mean that  to me it means     lots of context wickedly omitted by myself       anyway if i say joe is a hacker to most english speaking people who  know the word theyll probably think he is either a poor golfer or a  bad carpenter but there are very very few people who will think he is  a good and clever programmer      if you chose to call yourself by a term that means thief dont be  surprised when people think you are a thief even if you dont agree  with that definition of the word               the narrower view that a hacker when   associated with the computing environment is a dishonest   expert is not so widespread im my opinion at least with the   people involved with the field imho the wider meaning is not   obsolete at all no matter how much the lay press would like it to   be      therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker and somebody   perceives you as a thief then this person belongs to a very very   small group that has some computer knowledge but not enough to know   the wider and original meaning of the word    unfortunately the general public has a very narrow view of the deep dark recesses of the art of computing  what little they do see is from the view given to them by the media  from what i have seen from the media hacker is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person  i on the other hand know what hacker means from those who consider themselves such  following is the definition from jargon file 0000 this is also known as the hackers dictionary  the definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage     hacker originally someone who makes furniture with an axe n      0 a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable      systems and how to stretch their capabilities as opposed to most      users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary  0 one who      programs enthusiastically even obsessively or who enjoys      programming rather than just theorizing about programming  0 a      person capable of appreciating hack value  0 a person who is      good at programming quickly  0 an expert at a particular program      or one who frequently does work using it or on it as in a unix      hacker  definitions 0 through 0 are correlated and people who      fit them congregate  0 an expert or enthusiast of any kind  one      might be an astronomy hacker for example  0 one who enjoys the      intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing      limitations  0 deprecated a malicious meddler who tries to      discover sensitive information by poking around  hence password      hacker network hacker  see cracker       the term hacker also tends to connote membership in the global      community defined by the net see network the and      internet address  it also implies that the person described      is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic see      hacker ethic the       it is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe      oneself that way  hackers consider themselves something of an      elite a meritocracy based on ability though one to which new      members are gladly welcome  there is thus a certain ego      satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker but if      you claim to be one and are not youll quickly be labeled      bogus  see also wannabee     hacker ethic the n  0 the belief that informationsharing      is a powerful positive good and that it is an ethical duty of      hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and      facilitating access to information and to computing resources      wherever possible  0 the belief that systemcracking for fun      and exploration is ethically ok as long as the cracker commits      no theft vandalism or breach of confidentiality       both of these normative ethical principles are widely but by no      means universally accepted among hackers most hackers subscribe      to the hacker ethic in sense 0 and many act on it by writing and      giving away free software  a few go further and assert that      all information should be free and any proprietary      control of it is bad this is the philosophy behind the gnu      project       sense 0 is more controversial some people consider the act of      cracking itself to be unethical like breaking and entering      but this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who      see themselves as benign crackers see also samurai  on      this view it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy      to a break into a system and then b explain to the sysop      preferably by email from a superuser account exactly how it      was done and how the hole can be plugged  acting as an      unpaid an unsolicited tiger team       the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker      ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share      technical tricks software and where possible computing      resources with other hackers  huge cooperative networks such as      usenet fidonet and internet see internet address      can function without central control because of this trait they      both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be      hackerdoms most valuable intangible asset    finally a true hacker does not name himselfherself one for this is   a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large  to me a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who  says nahh i just know a thing or two people always exagerate   note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself meaning himselfherself one but simply says that it is better not to do so  there are many who do not know the meaning of hacker  so in order to defend the true meaning of the word it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known respected hacker around the workplace  this means that hacker is defined in terms of some wellknown and respected person  sometimes there may only be one such person   no matter what mr dumpty says language doesnt work that way   actually it does you just have to get adequate press coverage   language works anyway that we want it to work  the purpose of language is to communicate  to oversimplify as long as communication is taking place

  some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same direction  ie on a closed cube all normals point outwards  you can use the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal by making sure that all points are either in clockwise or counterclockwise order  how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a  set of points edges and faces   say that you had a cube with all faces that  have their normals facing outwards except for one face  whats the best way to realize that face is flipped and should have its points reordered   i thought i had a good way of telling this but then realized that the algorithm i had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise order for a 0d polygon  id like something for 0d data  any hints tips references would be appreciated  steve   where humor is concerned there are no standards  no one can say what is good  or bad although you can be sure that everyone will   john kenneth galbraith  these opinions are my own

   how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a  set of points edges and faces   look for edge inconsistencies  consider two vertices p and q which are connected by at least one edge  if pq is an edge then qp should not appear    if both pq and qp appear as edges then the surface flips when you travel across that edge  this is bad    assuming warningwarningwarning that you have an otherwise acceptable surface  you can pick an edge any edge and traverse the surface enforcing consistency with that edge        0 pick an edge pq and mark it as ok     0 for each face f containing this edge if more than 0 oops        make sure that all edges in f are consistent ie the face        should be pqqrrssttp  flip those which        are wrong mark all of the edges in f as ok        and add them to a queue check for duplicates and especially        inconsistencies  dont let the queue have both pq and qp      0 remove an edge from the queue and go to 0  if a marked edge is discovered to be inconsistent then you lose  if step 0 finds more than one face sharing a particular edge then you lose       otherwise when done all of the edges will be consistent  which means that all of the surface normals will either point in or out  deciding which way is out is left as an exercise      kenneth sloan                   computer and information sciences sloancisuabedu               university of alabama at birmingham 000 0000000                  000a campbell hall uab station  000 0000000 fax              birmingham al 000000000

   one thing  a small change in initial conditions can cause a huge  change in final conditions  there are certain things about the way  the plate tektoniks and volcanic activity effect a land scape that  is while not entirely random unpredictable  this is also true with  fractals so one could also conclude that you could model this  fractally   yeah and its also true most long complicated sequences of events calculations or big computer programs in general  i dont argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals i just question whether you should  the fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we cant model should be replaced with a random number generator  that has been useful for instance in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system but i dont think it has much to do with fractals and i certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner  i guess i just havent seen all these earthshaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists  i really hope i do but im not holding my selfsimilar breath   there is one other thing that fractals are good for  fractal  image compression  uh huh  ill believe it when i see it  ive been chasing fractal compression for a few years and i still dont believe in it  if its so great how come we dont see it competing with jpeg  cause it cant ill wager  actually i have wagered i quit trying to make fractal compression work and i was trying because i dont think its a reasonable alternative to other techniques  it is neat though   ill reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal  thats why i dont think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical  i know barnsley and sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work but i dont see anyone using it in a real product  its been six years since iterated systems was formed right  there are always going to be questions until theres a product out there sloan replies  the company plans to ship its first encoding devices in the summer he says  in march iterated systems will have the other half of the system the decoders   scientific american march 0000 page 00  allen b dont even get me started

   youll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing in the new colours  use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g  b values in the range from 000 for most cards for a particular palette colour in the range from 0000 for 000 colour modes  then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and the result should be ok  you might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have more than 000 unique rgb triplets for a 000 colour mode   geoff thomasgeoffreycosccanterburyacnz computer science dept university of canterbury private bag christchurch oook  new zealand

  hi  i am digitizing a ntsc signal and displaying on a pc video monitor it is known that the display response of tubes is nonlinear and is sometimes said to follow gammalaw i am not certain if these nonlinearities are gammacorrected before encoding ntsc signals or if the tv display is supposed to correct this   also if  000 grey levels for example are coded in a c program do these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a pc monitor in other words does pc monitor display circuitry correct for gamma errrors   your response is much appreciated   amjad  amjad soomro ccs computer science center u of maryland at college park email amjadwamumdedu

   does anybody know what delaunay triangulation is is there any reference to it  is it useful for creating 0d objects if yes whats the advantage  it is used to create a tin triangulated irregular network which is basically a bunch of triangles which form a surface over a group of points  what is special about it is that the triangles formed are the  most equalateral possible  check out proceedings of autocarto n where n is 000  sorry i dont have a specific reference describing the process michael

    i am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a   polygon does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing  information on the subject     regards    simon  basically there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside outside or on the polygon the first one is ray or half line method in this method you can draw any ray if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even then it is outside if the number is odd then it is inside of cause you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache  the second method is pi algorithm draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines if the result is 0pi then it is inside if pi then it is on the polygon otherwise it is outside  my experience tells the second method is relible  hope this helps  yeh usc

  sorry i missed you raymond i was just out in dahlgren last month  im the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics so perhaps i can help a little  rchuinswcwonswcnavymil raymond chui writes  hello the real reality our agency started to express interest in  virtual realityvr  so far we do not know much about vr  all we  know about are the hollywood movies the terminater 0 and lawnmover  man  we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and  computer graphics world magazine   unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects for both terminator 0 and lawnmower man those are filmquality computer graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time  each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on highend parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time 00 frames per second      we certainly want to know more about vr  who are the leading  companies  agencies universities  what machines support vr ie sgi sun0  hp0000 bim0000 etc   it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 00 to 00 newly rendered frames per second  this is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous  thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations  additionally the frame rate must be constant  if the system renders 00 frames per second at one point then 00 frames per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in realtime  unix in general does not support realtime operation but silicon graphics has modified the unix kernel for its multiprocessor systems to be able to support realtime operation bypassing the usual unix process prioritymanagement schemes  uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support realtime operation not sun sparc00 not hp 000 series systems not ibm rs0000 not even sgis uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support realtime operation due to their symmetric multiprocessing smp sharedmemory architecture  from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and realtime multisample antialiasing  of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine0 systems fully support these capabilities the antialiasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment     what kind of graphics languages are used with vr  gl opengl phigs pex gks etc  you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop vr applications but that is starting at a pretty low level there are offthe shelf software packages available to get you going much faster being targeted directly at the vr application developer some of

  hi everyone  i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups  announcing the release of multiverse000  multiverse is a multiuser nonimmersive xwindows based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainmentresearch  features     clientserver based model using berkeley sockets    no limit to the number of users apart from performance    generic clients    customizable servers    hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources    multiple light sources ambient point and spot    objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily         attached  functionality    client    the client is built around a fast render loop basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the users    viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the users    actions  which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users     the client is designed to be generic  in other words you dont need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it the adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers     this release of the client software supports the following functionality      o hierarchical objects with associated addressing      o multiple light sources and types ambient point and spot      o user interface panels      o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rates      o mouse and keyboard input     some people may be disappointed that this software doesnt support the    powerglove as an input device  this is not because it cant but because    i dont have one this will however be one of the first enhancements    servers    this is where customization can take place the following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers      o transparent client management      o client message handling     this may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them  the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally     things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects      o server selectable extension installation         what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world basically you call the extension         initialisers you want      o event handler registration         when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to         current events supported init move change collide  terminate      o collision detection registration         if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software         your callback will be activated when a collision occurs      this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose      the following is all you need to make a world server application      o provide an initworld function         this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus         any initialization you want to do      o provide a positionobject function         this is where you determine where to place a new client      o provide an installworldobjects function         this is where you load the world wld file for a new client      o provide a getworldtype function         this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have      o provide an animateworld function         this is where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the objects         move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit         to avoid outrunning the clients      thats all there is to it and to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers ive provided          generic  00 lines         dactyl  000 lines more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs will probably be improved with future                            versions         dogfight  00 lines  location     this software is located at the following site    ftpuwashingtonedu     directory    pubvirtualworlds     file    multiverse000tarz  futures     client      o texture mapping      o more realistic rendering ie zbuffering or similar gouraud shading      o hmd support      o etc etc     server      o physical modelling gravity friction etc      o enhanced object managementinteraction      o etc etc     both      o improved comms  i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and im not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified   i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe  ive certainly found fascinating developing it and i would love to add support for the powergloveand an hmd   finally one major

  comet wrote      in a previous article trb0ramsstateedu tony r boutwell says    there is a new product for the ibmers out there it is called  imagine and it just started shipping yesterday i can personally attest that it will blow the doors off of 0dstudio  it is made by impulse and is in its    welli dont know about its competing with 0d studio but  its pretty powerful allright  yes but a key issue is speed how fast is imagine and is it as easy to use as 0d studio can it just do a render as fast as 0ds if you dont want things like ior etc 0ds can do fine shadows animated reflection maps animated bump maps animated anything maps and with the ipas routines  not that ive ever seen them it can do explosions top quality morphing fire rain lens flares etc im not knocking imagine i just want to know how it compares with 0ds

   i would be most thrilled if some kind person could help me with the following  given a cylinder in 0d defined as a line segment between two points and  a radius eg sxsysz to exeyez and r what is the easiest and not  too expensive way to find if a ray defined as another line through two  points cuts through this cylinder and if so where    i think the test for touching is rather simple if the closest approach  of the two lines is less than r then the ray does penetrate the cylinder  nope this wont work for a cylinder you can have a line arbitrarily close to the the cylinder backbone and yet not intersect it the test works for a pillbox though a cylinder with two hemispheres attached at the ends   thanks  ryan koehlersecsucscedu  arun

  the original posting complained 0 about sgi coming out with newer and better architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones and 0 that dec did  no  thats not what i was complaining about nor did i intend to suggest that dec was any better than sgi let me tell you about the lynx some day but be prepared with a large sedative if you do  my comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi  what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck  im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while rather than being flushed  now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter but im just a little tired of getting boned in the process  maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa for instance are  this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond  that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other vendor  im going to be looking at this box for the next five years and every time i look at it im going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money since were supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars  now youll have to pardon me while i go off and hiss and fume in a corner somewhere and think dark libelous thoughts  spl   steve lamont sciviguy  000 0000000  splszechuanucsdedu san diego microscopy and imaging resourceuc san diegola jolla ca 000000000 my other car is a car too                   bumper strip seen on i000

  our group recently bought a mitsubishi p00u video printer and i could use some help with it  we bought this thing because it 0 has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and 0 claimed to print 000 gray level images  however the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 0 and 0 bitpixel images  after some initial problems with the parallel interface i now have this thing running from a parallel port of an hewlettpackard workstation and i can print 0 and 0 bitpixel images just fine  i called the mitsubishi people and asked about the 000 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs  this was not mentioned in the sales literature  however they did say the p00u can do 0 bitpixel 00 level images in parallel mode but they didnt have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call japan etc  frankly i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 0 bitpixel images from the video source it cant store 0 bitspixel in the memory  its not like memory is that expensive any more  if anybody has any information on getting 0 bitpixel or even 0 bitpixel images out of this thing i would greatly appreciate your sending it to me  thanks  allan weber signal  image processing institute university of southern california webersipiuscedu

   my  comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other  vendors  that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi  opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive 0d graphics applications it is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor  sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable     what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that  we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the  crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck  if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team feel free to contact the local branch managerwe understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot     im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a  previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around  for a while rather than being flushed  as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in 0000 and grew to include the 0d00 0d00 0d00 and 0d00 as clock rates sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about 00 years this was true of the motorolabased 0000 series 0000 the pi 0000 the professional series the early 0ds  0000 the power series parallel systems 0000 individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 0 years new graphics architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every 00 months to 0 years  these are the facts of life  if we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and io and larger disk capacities if we dont we become uncompetitive  from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today  you cant wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep for one in writing if its feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the performance protection program for older r0000based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r0000based 00bit multiprocessor systems     now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to  keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself  pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books  just before the end of the quarter but im just a little tired of  getting boned in the process    if thats happening its becausing of misunderstandings or miscommunication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base   maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we  arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa  for instance are  this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs  and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers  every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis  most sgi customers are onesytwosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we preannounced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments   the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the  entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that  means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i  have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one  previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other  vendor  im going to be looking at this box for the next five years  and every time i look at it im going to think about sgi and how i  could have better spent my money actually your money since were  supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars    five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor technologies are arriving every 00 years making a 0 year old computer at least 0 and probably 0 generations behind the times the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really 0 years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor  there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so dont give up we know it  josh                joshua mogal     product manager advanced graphics division     advanced graphics systems silicon graphics

  hi steve  as the author of multiverse i feel i had better respond to your mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this software  the quick answer is yes the long answer is yes  but a few have had a few problems with their platforms  not all unixs are the same you know as far as many bugs go it would probably be more useful to everyone including you if you were a bit more explicit   platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are rs0000 dec ultrix sun solaris so it is possible  the main problem is that i dont have access to other platforms than the rs0000 so if there are portability problems then the only way i hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it  as far as the software not doing anything do you really think i would bother releasing it if that was the case perhaps you didnt read the few docs that are supplied the dogfight world is made up of clients only so if youre in there on your own then youre not going to see anything the dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary  so if you dont see anything there then this is definitely a problem  one final word  if youre not interested dont bother with it if you are interested then please remember that im not asking for any money so why not try a little patience and constructive criticism maybe that will get results  robert robertacsccom   
  i dont think speed has been determined since it has never run on intel chips but on the amigas motorola chips it was one of the fastest true ray tracers  i dont think impulse would port it over and not take speed into consideration  in terms of features and learning curve all that you stated for 0ds is also true for imagine and lots more but ill have to admit that after 0 years of use on the amiga the learning curve is very steep this is due only to the manual it is realy bad however there is a lot of after market support for this product including regular tips articles in many magazines such as avid and a great book by steve worley called understanding imagine 00 this book i is not just recommened it is a must  i think an important consideration should be price 0000 for 0ds not including tool packages under 000 for imagine complete

  hi there  ive made a vga mode 00h graphics library available via ftp  i originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself but perhaps someone here will find them useful  they are certainly useable as they are but are missing some higherlevel functionality  theyre intended more as an intro to mode 00h programming a starting point   the library assumes a 000 processor but it is trivial to modify it  for a 000  if enough people ask ill make the mods and repost it as a  different version  the routines are written in assembly tasm and are callable from c  they are fairly simple but ive found them to be very fast for my purposes anyway  routines are included to enter and exit mode 00h define a virtual screen put and get pixels put a pixmap rectangular image with no transparent spots put a sprite image with seethru areas copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory etc  ive also included a simple c routine to draw a line as well as a c routine to load a 000 color gif image into a buffer  i also wrote a quickndirtytm demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three windows  the whole package is available on spangcamosunbcca in pubdosvglzip  it is zipped with pkzip 000g  it is completely in the public domain as far as im concerned  do with it whatever you like  however itd be nice to get credit where its due and maybe an email telling me you like it if you dont like it dont bother  mark morleycamosunbcca

  a very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in cview since he isnt in the position to post this himself he asked me to post it for him but to leave his name out so here it comes  cview has quite a number of bugs  the one you mention is perhaps the most annoying but not the most dangerous  as far as i can determine it has to do with the temp files that cview creates  cview gives the user no control over where it places its temp files it just places them in its current directory  the problem you mention occurs as far as i can tell when it runs out of disk space for its temp files it seems as if cview doesnt check properly for this situation  as cview decodes a jpeg it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 00 bit colour information then for 0 bit displays it does the dithering again writing another file with the 0 bit colour information  while it is writing this second file it also writes the data to your colour card then when it does the last chunk of 0 bit data it recopies all the data from the 0 bit file to your screen again  it does this last recopy operation for its fit to screen feature even when this feature is not enabled   the result of this process is the following         0 if it runs out of disk space when writing the first 00 bit file all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because cview never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writesreads arent performed       0 if it has enough room for the 00 bit data but runs out of room for         the 0 bit data you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card         however then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 0 bit file to screen for whatever reason it does this         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk  this is just a guess but probably fairly accurate  at least the general idea is on track i think although i have probably made errors in details about file io etc  the way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space  the temp files for large jpegs 0000x000 and bigger can be very large 0 meg  0 meg   on some of the largest i have needed in excess of 0 meg free disk space   cview has a much more serious bug if you are trying to display a file from a floppy and you change floppies while cview has some temp file open on the floppy then cview in certain circumstances will write the directory and fat table i cant remember for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious possibly unrevcoverable way  so be careful  it is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this  on the other hand when choosing files in the open files menu cview insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hilighter square  incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info  and really how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing   with much thanks to the originator of this article            rene walter                    renewstackurctuenl                will i drown in tears of sorrow is there hope for tomorrow               will this world ever get better cant we all just live together           i dont wanna live in strife   i just wanna live my life                  i deserve to have a future                                                                                the good girls    future

  hi everyone   i am  looking for  some software  called shadow as  far as  i know  its a   simple  raytracer  used in the  visualization  of  synchrotron   beam  lines now we have  an  old  version of the  program here but unfortunately we dont have any documentation if anyone knows  where i  can  get  some  docs or maybe  a  newer  version  of  the program or  even  another  program that does the same sort of  thing i would love to hear from you  ps i think shadow was written by a f cerrina  anyone any ideas  thanks gary serc daresbury lab

  hi  im hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science project group we are doing computer science honours and our project is to do a graphical simulator for a finite state automata  basically the program must draw a diagram of a fsa from a textual grammar showing circles for states and labeled arcs inbetween  the problem is working out the best way to layout the states and draw the arcs inbetween so that as few arcs as possible cross each other  if anyone has any suggestionsalgorithmsbugfree ready to compile c code   that might help us it would be much appreciated  thanks in advance  gregory  
  hi to all out there  we have this problem and im not certain im solving it in the correct way  i was wondering if anyone can shed light on this or point me in the right place to look  we have an xray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole passing through it at a right angle to the tubes axis                                                                                                                      image                                                              xray source                                          screen                             metallic  tube                                                                                                                                    we know sourcescreen centre distance radius of the tube radius of the hole  we do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen  however the calculations are mathematically highly complex and must assume that the objects hole projects an image resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen in the centre of the screen  however it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently    firstly we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse  i cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is  do i have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation  how do i do this transformation  secondly there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar the sourcescreen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen  how can i compensate the ellipses axis for this image distortion  so please can anyone give us a few pointers here  how do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen and how do i deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen  wed appreciate any help either posted or emailed  thanks in advance simon   simon marshall dept of computer science university of hull hull hu0 0rx uk   football isnt about life and death  its more important than that bill email smarshallcshullacuk   phone 00 000 000000  fax 000000   shankley

   hi  im writing a program to convert dxf files to a database format used by a 0d graphics program ive written  my program stores the points of a polygon in ccw order  ive used 0d concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn  does the dxf format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in cw or ccw  its easy enough to convert but if i dont know which way they are stored i dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from  if dxf doesnt handle this can anyone recommend a workaround the best i can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the dxf file one stored cw and the other ccw  but that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed  thanks in advance for any help  patrice hugohydraunmedu

  what are the main advantages of this method  i have seen it described and the algiorithm seems a  little bit long  i developed my own method which requires that the points be in a counterclockwise order and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn method  it uses few calculations however basically it is several comparisons  the only disadvantage i see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand  my method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise  when looking at the back of something the points occur in an opposite direction from the front so merely by figuring out which way the points go you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 0d polygon  has anyone heard of this method before  it is so simple i doubt i am the first to think of it  libertarian atheist semianarchal technorat  i define myselftsacellarorg

  we need a good concave convex polygon conversion routine ive tried a couple without much luck  please email responses and i will post a summary of any replies  thank you  richard stoakley rws0vuvacscsvirginiaedu  the problem is not precisely defined above but if you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon then you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon  there are two ways to do this  use a somewhat tricky but bynow well examined lineartime algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull routine and accept on log n  both methods are discussed in preparata and shamos for example

hips on their first day    hips features images that are  selfdocumenting   each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image   hips includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of unix   filters  it comes complete with source  code  online manual   pages and online documentation    host configuration requirements    originally  developed at  new  york  university  hips  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available  it runs under the unix operating   system  it is modular  and  flexible provides automatic documentation   of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment   hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and   microvax sun apollo  masscomp  ncr tower iris ibm at etc   for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and   adage ikonas image processors and the sun0 sun0 sun 0 and   sun000i consoles  we also  supply  usercontributed

includes an   interface  for the  crs0000 it  is  a  simple matter to interface hips   with other frame stores and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max   video hips can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 00 of hips is machine independent    availability    hips has proven itself a highly flexible  system  both as  an   interactive  research tool and for more production oriented tasks it   is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses hips   is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format either reel toreel or   sun  cartridge and comes with source code libraries a library of   convolu tion masks and online documentation and manual pages    michael landy sharpimage

working   for alex goetz  you might try contacting them if you already have idl   or would be willing to buy it  its a few thousand dollars american i   expect for idl and the other should be free  those are the general   purpose packages ive heard of besides what terramar has   sips was written for aviris imagery  im not sure how general purpose   it is  you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask  i   have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification you can compute an image using selected components  ive   used it on 00 megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best   speed you need an external dsp card  it will work without it but large   images take quite a while 0000 times as long to process  thats a   freebie if you want it    my  favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems   inc  idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its   programming language is very strong and easy  very pascallike it   handles the numbercrunching very well also personally i like doing   the numbercrunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even   excel on the mac if its not too hairy then bringing it over to nih   image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldnt handle and the speed and ease of use   compared to iraf was incredible by the way its mostly astronomical   image processing which ive been doing this means image enhancement   cleaning up bad linespixels and some other traditional image   processing routines then for example taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line i choose with the mouse then doing a curve   fit to that line which i might do like in kaleidagraph    for idl call research systems  for pvwave call precision visuals and  for sips call university of colorado  boulder  from what i can  understand you can get packaged

applications   host configuration requirements    it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun   though there  were rumors there are always rumors that the software   would be  ported to pc and possibly a sun environment  pci    a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes   an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i   forget  the software is available in versions for msdos unix   workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly   other platforms by now  i use the vms version    the pci software consists of several classesgroupspackages of   utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci   database disk file  the tape io package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape   formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file   this is the only package i use or know much about  other packages can   display data from the pci database to one or another of several   pcisupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer eg an epsontype   dotmatrix graphics printer  you might be more spe cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and   fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg   multiply channel 0 by 0 add channel 0 and store as channel 0 and   god only knows what all else  theres a lot  i dont have and dont   use these so cant say much about them you only buy the packages your   particular applicationinterest calls for    each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from   a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default   directory  some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations  the standard pci environment contains a   scripting language very similar to ibmpc basic but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  in vms i can also   invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure  theres   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the pci   data structures database file parameter file    the pci software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but   requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the   level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well  for instance the tape io package offers a   utility for reading headerless multiband what adobe photoshop on the   macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different   interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphicarts industrys ct0t format would probably i havent tried   handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what   youre doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start   over  its worth noting that the pci database file is designed to   contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of   other information i observe that a remotesensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude   longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this   can go into the pci database    i believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  on vax   systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific   thirdparty display systems the name goulddeanza seems to come to   mind  one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vctq qbus   00bit directcolor display subsystem  pci software could be overkill   in your case it seems designed for the very high end   applicationsusers ie those for whom a macpc largely doesnt suffice   although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  its   probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which   does a lot of its landresource management via remote sensing i believe   the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these   areas  spam spectral analysis manager    back in 0000 jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis   manager which got a fair amount of use at the time  that was designed   for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data  000 pixels   across by  000 lines by  000 bands a modified version has since   been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging   spectrometer which uses much larger images    spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and   ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays   actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   stretching  spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering    the original spam uses x or sunview to display  the aviris version may   require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame   buffer  i can refer you to people if youre interested  pcw requires x   for display  map ii    among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley  clrview    clrview is a

   hi everyone  since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from 0 points i suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse from its offset for example given 0 points on the offset can you find the original ellipse analytically  i spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year but i failed under the pressure i had to use other method  nonlinear programming technique to deal with this problem approximately  any ideas will be greatly appreciated please post here let the others share our interests  yeh usc

    i am working on a project where we are going to be including both still and moving grapics within a database  of course jpeg and mpeg come to mind as the formats of choice for the various files  however from what i read on the net it seems as if there are several different forms of each of these  what i want to do is settle on a file format which i can count on as being a standard format 00 years from now  i know apple is going to support quicktime on the new power pcs and so this may be the format of choice  what format does apples quicktime use for their products  i guess it is some kind of mpeg for their motion picture is it any different than standard mpeg files  thanx for any info  art pollardaxraybyuedu

add a line such as path mynamemysite to specify your correct email address to reply to      0  what is jpeg  jpeg pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 0bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   0  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 00bitperpixel color data instead of 0bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 0 mbyte fullcolor file down to 000 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 00 bitspixel 00 million colors instead of 0 or less 000 or fewer colors  if you have only 0bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 0bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 0 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   0  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 00bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 0 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 00 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 000 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 0 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 00 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   0  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 000x000 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 0b  file   size in bytescomments  shipppm0000000  original file in ppm format no compression 00 bits  or 0 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead shipppmz 000000  ppm file passed through unix compress  compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note  other textoriented compressors give similar results shipgif 000000  converted to gif with ppmquant fs 000  ppmtogif  most of the savings is the result of losing color  info gif saves 0 bitspixel not 00  see sec 0  shipjpg00 000000  cjpeg q 00    highest useful quality setting  this is indistinguishable from the 00bit original  at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00    default setting  you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this  from the original even with both onscreen at once shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  this has slight defects if you know what to look  for you could tell its been jpeged without seeing  the original  still as good image quality as many  recent postings in usenet pictures groups shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  jpegs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent  at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some  still ive seen plenty of usenet postings that were  of poorer image quality than this shipjpg0o   0000  cjpeg q 0 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead  blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or  indexing purposes  note that this file is tiny  the compression ratio from the original is 0000   in this case jpeg can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 00 file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   0  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 00 does not mean keep 00 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 00 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 00 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 00 saying q 000 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 00 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 00 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 00 is about right for compressing 00bit images but q 00 to 00 is usually better for converting gifs see section 00 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 0 to 00 is about right  q 0 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 0b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   0  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   0a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  john bradleys free xv version 000 and up is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu or ftpcisupennedu  the file is called xvtarz where  is the version number currently 000 it is located in the contrib directory on export or the pubxv directory at upenn  xv reduces all images to 0 bits internally which means its not a real good choice if you have a 00bit display youll still get only 0bit color  also you shouldnt use xv to convert fullcolor images to jpeg because theyll get colorquantized first but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other 0bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in versions 000 and earlier be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 00bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 000  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage000tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v0 decoder while xloadimage 000 is using a hackedover v0  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli000tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 00bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os0 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 00a is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 000000000 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg00azip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 000 or 000000 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 00 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv00zip  hiview requires a 000 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm000 and 000max work windows and os0 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 00  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview00zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv0zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel00 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 000a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 00  available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw000azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic00 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg0zip or jpeg0000zip if you have a 000 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 0b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif0jpgjpg0gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 00bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 00 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif0jpg0zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy  this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats  it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 000 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsalch000zip  note about simtel00 the internets key archive site for pcrelated programs is simtel00 full name wsmrsimtel00armymil 0000000000  simtel00 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel00 that really means pd0msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel00  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel00 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 00000000000 which keeps simtel00 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel00 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel00 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 00 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 00 and 000ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version 00 is available from ftpcicaindianaedu 000000000 file pubpcwin0desktopjview000zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchivewustledu  winjpeg shareware 00 displays jpeggiftargatiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and slideshow  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows0winjp000zip  this is a slow 000compatible version if you register youll get the 000only version which is roughly 00 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 00  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 000 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin0desktopcview000zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos  dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in

most mac jpeg programs rely on apples jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a 00000 or better cpu and you need to be running system 000 or later  if youre running system 0 you must also install the 00bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 0  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 0000 this file contains quicktime 00 which is better than qt 00 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 00  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 00 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 00 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 000000 file infomacappjpegview00hqx  requires system 0 and quicktime  on 0bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 000x000 pixels on a typical 0mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 00 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 000  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter000hqx  requires system 000 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert00hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v00 a jpeggif converter based on an old version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt00stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 00bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 0 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 00bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress000hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 00bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 000 or later can read and write jfifformat jpeg files use the jpeg plugin from the acquire menu  you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it  amiga  most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at

software you are welcome to join   0  whats all this hoopla about color quantization  most people dont have fullcolor 00 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 0 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 000 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 0bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 000orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 000 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 000color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 000 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 000 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 000color gif on a 00color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan0bit display hardware already 00bit hicolor pc displays true 00bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   0  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart00  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   0  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 000 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v0 free jpeg code you can also say sample 0x0 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 00bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 0 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 0 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   00  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 00 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 00 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 0a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 00 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif0jpgjpg0gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   00  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  0  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d0 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 00 followed by jfif  0  if you see ff d0 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  0  hsi files start with hsi0  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  0  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d0 and you should be able to read it  0  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d0     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  begin line mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  begin line mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   00  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 0 or 00 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   00  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 00 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    00  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 0 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 000 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 00 or 00rd the size of the gif file not 00th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 00 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 00 to 00 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 000 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v0 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 00 or so when converting gifs values of 00 to 00 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 00 smooth 00 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information

  i plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as i have working code which i will also include  the intersection of 0 planes method looks best but my implementation based on a short article in  graphics gems i doesnt work  i may be misinterpreting of course  i had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products but the former may actually be better  in either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed implicitly in the solution of linear equations  to get the planes i was taking the midpoint of the line from say p0 to p0 and setting the normal as the normalized vector from p0 to p0 these just plugged into the formula in graphics gems  however the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 0 of my test points for different tests  my matrixvector math is very rusty but it looks like i need to verify the formula or use the simultaneous equation solution which will require bringing in another routine i dont have but should be easy to find  another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 0 sets of 0 points and intersecting the normals from there  this would also define the circle center  however small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect  supposedly 0 planes have to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel  ed  thanks to all who answered so far   ed bolson university of washington  cardiovascular research               0000000000 bolsonuwashingtonedu preferred bolsonmaxbitnet                bolsonmiltonuwashingtonedu if you must

  first off thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the 00000 i assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for further enhancements to the motorola line rather than meted out to another company ah well i guess thats what i get when i assume the computer industry will operate in a logical manner   muchado ricardorchlandvnetibmcom writes    sean i dont want to get into a miniwar by what i am going to say but i have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the centris youll see why please noflames i reserve those for csma       i was in chicago in the last consumer electronics show and apple had a booth there  i walked by and they were showing realtime video capture using a radious or supermac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies  i think the quicktime they were using was the old one 00  version 00 of quicktime is as has been stated the current version of the software the older version is 00 and 00 is on the horizon in the not too distant future     they digitized a guy talking there in 000x0xx something  it played back quite nicely and in real time  the guy then expanded the window resized to 00x by 0xx 000 in y i think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasnt 00fps or about 00fps anymore  it dropped to like 00 fps  then he increased it just a bit more and it dropped to 0000 fps   quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it does playing back resized movies apparently the process of expanding each frames image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate bit depth is pretty processorintensive there are optimizers that work pretty well for showing movies at double size but if you drop to 00x size or increase to 00x size performance suffers dramatically     then i asked him what mac he was using he was using a quadra dont know what model 000 to do it and he was telling the guys there that the quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an lcii  he lied  quicktime is very cpu dependent he was probably confused by the fact that qt is locked to an internal timecode and will play in the same amount of time on any machine however an lc will drop frames in order to keep the sound and video synced up  the centris and quadras have similar cpus and will thus boast similar performance though the quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture     well i spoiled his claim so to say since a 00000 quadra mac was having a little bit of trouble  and this wasnt even from the hardisk  this was from memory     could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assisted centris or another software product running the  animation like supposedly macrominds accelerator  i expect that the version of the quicktime software you saw was 00  i was using was 00 one of the new codecs in v00 allows video at nearly twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 00 could handle the centris 000 i saw was a plainvanilla with the exception of the nice speakers that were playing the sound and the software was movie player the qt player apple includes with the software     dont misunderstand me i just want to clarify this  no problem  it still surprises me that quicktime is able to do the things it does as well as it can  sean mcmains               check out the gopher     phone0000000000 university of north texas  new bands info server    fax  0000000000 po box 00000             at seanmacacsuntedu   email denton tx 00000                                      mcmainsuntedu

  lets say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything  on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true xy positions are known    now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danons excellent digitize program  that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to xy and saves those values when you click the mouse  upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values  this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you  the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretchingcontracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory  so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion  in particular if i have three sets of points   referencexy the known true values  distortedreferencexy the same points with known errors  distorteddataxy other points with unknown errors  what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors  i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy 0d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points  any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas or better yet pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems  thanks  earl

  lets say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything  on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true xy positions are known    now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danons excellent digitize program  that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to xy and saves those values when you click the mouse  upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values  this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you  the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretchingcontracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory  so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion  in particular if i have three sets of points   referencexy the known true values  distortedreferencexy the same points with known errors  distorteddataxy other points with unknown errors  what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors  i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy 0d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points  it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion  or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion  below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions feel free to poke me via email   assume locally smooth distortion  0 compute the delaunay triangulation of your xy points  this    defines the set of neighbors for each point  if your data are    not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull    consider deleting these edges  0 now there are two goals      a move the distorteddataxy to the referencexy     b keep the lengthe as measured from the current xys        as close as possible to the digitizedlengthe as measured         using the digitized xys  0 for every point compute a displacement based on a and b  for    example      a for xy points for which you know the referencexy you        can move alpha0referencexy  currentxy   this will        slowly move the distortedreferencexy towards the        referencexy      b for all other points examine the current length of each edge        for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength         take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the        point alpha0sumofedgedisplacements  this will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh  0 iterate 0 until you are happy for example no point moves very much  alpha0 and alpha0 need to be determined by experimentation   consider how much you believe the referencexy  ie do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges  warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially you cant allow the convex hull to change and you cant allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles  both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically retriangulating the points using  the current positions  but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions  when we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once  if i were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 0 years i might go back and retriangulate on every iteration  if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other pointbut first read up on linear solutions to the nbody problem  there are lots of papers in the last 00 years of siggraph proceedings on springs constraints  and energy

   about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult  i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published  solutions to it  the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines  for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional ie only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space  to draw  the object we   0 fit a cubic spline through the points  each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve  each spline has an equal number of segments  we assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure 0 take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline  use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface 0 depth sort the triangles 0 take each triangle in sorted order project onto a 0d pixmap draw and color the triangle  take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color  it is the edge coloring in step 0 that is at the heart of the problem  the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface  the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines  if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area  thanks

   getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape is harder than it looks  the standard vga and ega outputs are  very different than the ntsc format used by televisions  while there is equipment that will do the conversion it is hard to get your hands on and costs quite a bit  if you have access to an amiga computer that has an ntsc output you can transfer certain types of graphic files by modem and tape them from the ntsc output  unfortunately this would be framebyframe and would lead to unbelievably scratchy animation unless you had a good amiga animation program  otherwise see if your local public access cable station has equipment that you can use

   hi everyone  because no one has touched the problem i posted last week i guess my question was not so clear now id like to describe it in detail  the offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse in other words the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere  this problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used the tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the balls center is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse the answer is no ironically dmis  an american indutrial standard says it is ellipse so almost all the software which was implemented on the base of dmis was wrong the software was also sold internationaly imagine how many people have or will suffer from this bug how many qualified parts with ellipse werewill be discarded and most importantly how many defective parts with ellipse arewill be used  i was employed as a consultant by a company in los angeles last year to specially solve this problem i spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming now my solution nonlinear is not ideal because i can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset it is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method i used is not analytical i am now wondering if i didnt touch the base and make things complicated please give me a hint  i know you may argue this is not a cg problem you are right it is not however so many people involved in the problem sphere from 0 poits why not an ellipse and why not its offset  please post here and let the others share our interests  i got several emails from our netters they said they need the summary of the answers  yeh usc

  tsacellarorg the silent assassin writes rgc0000bcsteccaboeingcom robert g carpenter writes   can you please offer some recommendations  its really not that hard to do  there are books out there which explain everything and the basic 0d functions translation rotation shading and hidden line removal are pretty easy  i wrote a program in a few weeks witht he help of a book and would be happy to give you my source  i think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel   yes i want to concentrate on other development issues  ive created graphics  libraries before its too time consuming lifes too short  also quickdraw has a lot of 0d functions built in and think pascal can access them and i would expect that think c could as well  if you can find out how to use the quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the mac so should be fast  just to clarify the 0d routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray not the rom of the mac  a few years ago before i knew anything about implementing graphics i came across a demo of the apple grafsys0d library and it actually did a lot  however it is quite limited in the sense that its a lowlevel 0d library your code still has to plot individual points draw each line etc ad nauseum  it has nothing on gl for example where you can handle objects   thanks for the clarification before posting my original request i had looked  into the macs 0d capabilities and dismissed them as low grade  bobc

   the idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon not necessarily rectangular as a window  my problem then is in finding out all the new vertices of the resulting subpolygons from the first one  is this simply a matter of extending the usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked against another polygon  is there a simpler way  comments welcome  noel

  please note the newsgroups  recent discussion about xvs problems were held in some newsgroup here is some text users of xv might find interesting i have added more to text to this collection article so read on even you so my articles a while ago  i hope author of xv corrects those problems as best he can so fine program xv is that it is worth of improving i have also minor ideas for 00bit xv email me for them  any misundertanding of mine is understandable   juhana kouhia   clip   deleted  note that xv saves only 0bitrasterized images that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpegtogiftojpeg quality also theres three kind of 0bit quantizers your final image quality depends on them too   this were the situation when i read jpeg faq a while ago   imho it is design error of xv there should not be such confusing errors in programs theres two errors   xv allows the saving of 0bitrasterized image as jpeg even the    original is 00bit  saving 0bitrasterized image instead of    original 00bit should be a special case   xv allows saving the 0bitrasterized image made with any quantizer     the main case should be that xv quantizes the image with the    best quantizer available before saving the image to a file lousier    quantizers should be just for viewing purposes and a special cases    in saving the image if at all   clip  clip   deleted  it is limit of xv but not limit of design it is error in design it is error that 0bitquantizedrasterized images are stored as jpegs jpeg is not designed to that  as matter of fact im sure when xv were designed 00bit displays were known it is not bad error to program a program for 0bit images only at that time but when 00bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 00bit images that were not done and now we have  the program violate jpeg design and any 00bit image format  the program has human interface errors  otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 00bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use   deleted   clip  some new items follows  clip  i have seen that xv quantizes the image sometimes poorly with best00 option than with default option we have the reason surely is the quantizer used as best00 it is surprise the same than used in ppmquant  if you remember i have tested some quantizers in that test i found that rlequant with default is best then comes djpeg fbmquant xv our default in that order in my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly  it actually gave image with bad artifacts  i dont know is ppmquant improved any but i expect no so use of xvs best00 option is not very good idea  i suggest that author of xv changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant  im sure rlepeople gives permission another could be one used in imagemagick i have not tested it so i can say nothing about it  clip  clip  some minor bugs in human interface are  key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer often it happens that i make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place it is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately the buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete  also good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for xv after the image is completed often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly just when im writing something with editor or such those key pressings then go to xv and image has gone or something weird  in the color editor when i turn a color meter and release it xv updates the images it is impossible to change all rgb values first and then get the updated image it is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet i suggest of adding an apply button to update the exchanges done  clip

  in 0qjrecqemnetworkucsdedu splivemucsdedu steve lamont writes  what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that  we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the  crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck  it should have been made fairly clear that the most crimson would ever get was a 000 00 old style mhz cpu upgrade  certainly this was mentioned on compsyssgi on more than one occasion as being likely  if our sales folks were saying otherwise they were either confused or less than honestethical or somebody further up the chain inside sgi was misleading them   im also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a  previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around  for a while rather than being flushed  there were 0 versions 00 00 00 00 although admittedly the 00 came out at the same time as the 00 over a period of 0 00 years  the chassis simply couldnt be pushed any further  id say 0 years was a pretty good lifespan myself for a system design in this day and age  getting the 00 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups we would have been out of our minds to push it further and i know that was made clear almost from the day the 00 started shipping  we had one last kicker in the form of the elan graphics which made 0 graphics versions over its lifespan which i also think is pretty good   now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to  keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself  pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books  just before the end of the quarter but im just a little tired of  getting boned in the process  please by all means send a complaint letter through sgi support or sales on your concerns  there should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers sure sometimes there will be confusion for a while over whether an upgrade will be available but that shouldnt last too long and doesnt seem to be what you are referring to  yes the sales folks do get bonuss at the end of some all quarters but that is pretty common industry wide and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that arent what they need im sure but nobody is forcing you to buy at end of quarter after all   maybe its because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we  arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa  for instance are  this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs  they dont get all that long a lead time either although certainly they get presentations on possible new products and their opinions may well influence the end product but that also is life in the industry  we cant design systems that meet just their needs or we wont sell too many systems after all which is not to say that we dont have some niche products like reality engine   and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers  every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis  the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the  entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond  that  means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i  have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one  previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other  vendor  im going to be looking at this box for the next five years  and every time i look at it im going to think about sgi and how i  could have better spent my money actually your money since were  supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars  but surely you dont expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period  thats a rather unreasonable expectation in my experience with workstationsmicrocomputers  supported and parts available yes but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest   now youll have to pardon me while i go off and hiss and fume in a  corner somewhere and think dark libelous thoughts  i missed your first posting but as i say by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside sgi where it might have an effect not immediate im sure but complaints arent going to be ignored and may affect future plans if we  hear similar things from more than one personsite  all of the above is as usual my personal opinion not sgis  let no one tell me that silence gives consent     dave olson because whoever is silent dissents                silicon graphics inc     maria isabel barreno                           olsonsgicom ps i start my sabbatical 00 may ask those questions now

     the otis project 00          the operative term is stimulate    this file last updated00000   what is otis  otis is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny     and distribution  digital immortality  the basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around nearforever  the gifs and jpgs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future  perhaps theyll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapesbut theyll be thereand someone will dig them up     if that doesnt interest you otis also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your worksa virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors  suddenly life is  breathed into your workand by merit of its stimulus it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons   spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts  keep your own copies of the images to look at when youve got the gumption thats what theyre here for    where               otis currently as of 00000 has two ftp sites      0000000000 projectsotis the uwi site  sunsiteuncedu pubmultimediapicturesotis the sunsite  you can also gopher to this site for otis as well  merely anonymous ftp to either site on internet and change to the appropriate directory  dont forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure youre in binary  otis has also been spreading to some dialup bbs systems around north americathe following systems have a substancial supply of otistuff underground cafe omaha 0000000000 0 lines cyberden sanfran 0000000000  usenet waffleiron     how do you contribute                what happens isyou draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo get it scanned into an image file then either ftpput it in the contribincoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me email addresses at eof in email  after the image is received it will be put into the correct directory  computer originated works are also welcome  otis directories house two types of image files gif and jpg   gif and jpg files require oddly enough a gif or jpg viewer to  see  these viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large ftp sites around internet  jpg viewers are a bit tougher to find  if you cant find one but do have a gif viewer   you can obtain a jpgtogif conversion program which will change     jpg files to a standard gif format   otis also accepts animation files        when you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people to view  also include some biographical information on yourself well be having infofiles on each contributing artist and their works  you  can also just upload a textfile of info about yourself instead of  emailing  if you have pictures but no scanner there is hope  merely send copies to  the otis project co ed stastny po bx 000000 omaha ne 000000000  i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them  include an ample sase if you want your stuff back   also include information on each image preferably a 00 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where its finally put  if you have preferences as to what the images are to be named include those as well     conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and well arrange things  if you want to submit your works by disk peachy  merely send a 00 disk to the above address omaha and a sase if you want your disk back this is good for people who dont have direct access to encoders or ftp but do have access to a scanner  we accept disks in either mac or ibm compatible format  if possible please submit image files as gif or jpg  if you cantwe can convert from most formatswed just rather not have to  at senders request we can also fill disks with as much otis as they can stand  even if you dont have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an sase or 000 for disk postage and packing to  get a slabootis  as of 000000 were at about 00 megabytes of files and growing   email me for current archive size and directory    distribution  the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another  in fact we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such  if you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images     it would also be nice if youd send me a note when you did post images from otis to your local bbs  i just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is  its the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as possible  if you have the time please upload a few to your favorite bbs systemor even just post this infofile there  it would be keen of you    use  if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory youll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit  you will either find this in the rm file for     the image or series of imagesor in the artists directory under the  artists name  if permission isnt explicitly given then youll have  to contact the artist to ask for it  if no info is available email me edcwisunomahaedu and ill get in contact with the artist for  you or give you their contact information   when you do use permitted work its always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files    naming images  please keep the names of your files in dos format  that means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less  the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number thus leonardo devincis fifth mechanical drawing would be something like   ldmek0gif     or    ldmek0jpg    or    ldmech0gif   etc  keeping the names under 0 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems        creating image files  when creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture  this gives people a reference in case theyd like to contact you  you may also want to include a title address or other information youd like people to know    hmmm  thats about it for now  more guidelines will be added as needed your input is

   our shop uses a package called cadcore  very good  to scan and subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps the problem is that once the raster file is loaded into the cadcore package a header is added to the hrf file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter we would like to be able to ship some of the alreadyaltered raster images for further use on our workstations so here are my questions   0 what is the hitachi format  i need this format so i can recognize precisely what to strip out i strongly suspect that its a compressed format  if so then t might not be possible for me to strip out the offending header   0 are there any unix packages that read and recognize hrf it would be really nice to find some sort of hrftopbm converter out there    ive already searched some of the more wellknown ftp sites which contain graphics formats documentation with no luck so if you know or knwo someone who knows  please email thanks

   printer model and specification  canon clc 000 color laser copier psipu unit postscript intelligent processing unit   hello  we have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copierprinter  we want to be able to print to it from our sgi iris network  the  copierprinter has both a parallel and scsi interface  i have configured the printer with the lp system using the parallel interface and can print  postscript files to the printer  i can also print rgb files but these are in  turn converted to postscript by an internal filter  the canon clc 000 is a  publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts  are less than acceptable  we create the postscript files with a variaty of  programs such as showcase xv and tops  when we convert to postscript  with tops and use the l option to specify the halftone screen density of 00  rather than the default 00 the output is better but still much less that  acceptable  note that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript  we suspect that if we could use the scsi interface we would get higher quality  pictures  we have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the  scsi port  to my knowledge this software is 0000 and does not come with a  warranty  the management here does not want to spend this much money without  some assurance that the product will work   here my questions  if anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the scsi or  parallel port  what is the quality of the printouts  is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts  what is the limiting component the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on  the printer   the big question  where can i get some software to drive the scsi port for this printer    please email directly to me i dont not read news on a regular basis  i will post a summary  thanks in advance    emailscottncifcrfgov phone 000 0000000         title  sr systems manageranalyst

  preston writes  why not use the pd c library for readingwriting tiff files it took me a  good 00 minutes to start using them in your own app  i certainly do use it whenever i have to do tiff and it usually works very well  thats not my point  im philosophically opposed to it because of its complexity  this complexity has led to some programs poor tiff writers making some very bizarre files other programs inability to load tiff images though theyll save them of course and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand tiff  as the saying goes its not me im worried about its all the other  assholes out there  ive had big trouble with misuse and abuse of tiff over the years and i chalk it all up to the immense and unnecessary complexity of the format  in the words of the tiff 00 spec appendix g page g0 capitalized emphasis mine  the only problem with this sort of success is that tiff was designed to be powerful and flexible at the expense of simplicity  it takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification probably no application does a complete job and that is currently the only way you can be sure that you will be able to import any tiff image since there are so many imagegenerating applications out there now   if a program or worse all applications cant read every tiff image that means there are some it wont some that i might have to deal with  why would i want my images to be trapped in that format  i dont and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning not that anyone does of course   ab

  there is another useful method based on least sqyares estimation of the sphere equation parameters  the points xyz on a spherical surface with radius r and center abc can be written as      xa0  yb0  zc0  r0  this equation can be rewritten into the following form       0ax  0by  0cz  r0  a0  b0 c0  x0  y0  z0  approximate the left hand part by   fxyz  p0x  p0x  p0z  p00  for all datapoints ic 0 determine the 0 parameters p0p0 which minimise the average error fxyz  x0  y0  z00  in numerical recipes in c can be found algorithms to solve these parameters  the best fitting sphere will have   center abc  p00 p00 p00  radius r  sqrtp0  aa  bb  cc  so at last will this solve you sphere estination problem at least for the most situations i think   quick van rijt rytg0feltnonl

  if this question is covered elsewhere i apologize but i need information fast  my department has been given a large sum of money to install a video system on our network of ibm rs0000 workstations  this is not an area in which i have any expertise so i wonder if anyone out there can offer advice  we would like a system based either on vhs or 0mm video which will allow one  write video frame by frame on tape for playback in real time  its for visualization of physics problems  can anyone tell me what hardware is available which would work for our system  some support software is obviously needed too but nothing particularly sophisticated since the software we actually use for the visualization is all already written  please email with replies as i dont read this group  many thanks for your help  dr m e j newman department of physics cornell university newmmeheliostncornelledu

     hi im just getting into povray and i was wondering if there is a graphic  package that outputs pov files  any help would be appreciated  thanks    a very good modeling package i found is irit look for irittarz however there is no converter from its format to pov format i postet  a request for such a converter in this group but got no response so im considering to write such a program myself     sebastian schmidt tu ilmenau institut f praktische informatik    
   ive got a 000 00hz computer which is under warranty and my trident 0000c video card is starting to playup surprise surprise therefore im going to try to exchange it for a better card  the big question is  which video card is high quality and with an acceptable price tag on student budget   thank you in advance    
  for some reason i never saw the original post on this thread but if you are looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a pc you really cant go past the mode x stuff from dr dobbs this code is all pdomain as far as i know and in the original articles the routines were all presented as dumb vga routines and then optimised to modex with some interesting discussion along the way if you are interested i could find out more details of the issues in question i have them at home  bernard

   has anyone created any interesting animations using dmorph i seem to be unable to create anything that looks remotely realistic although this is probably due to the crappy gifs at i am using one of captain kirk and one of spock im a bit of a trekker  what are the best type of pictures to use thanks             asitunayake

      i bought the diamond stealth 00 a few months ago  it seems to be a great card especially with my multimedia presentations  it runs graphics and animation as well as some near full motion video very well  the only thing i can tell that it lacks is speed above 000 colors  its qualit in between 000 and 000 million collors un unreal but you definitly compromise speed  it seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes with some great software but im not so sure about the excelerator part  i used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster than that  one thing i do like is that it loads its own vesa driver from rom at startup i think because i have never had to load it for links000 or any other programs that require special vesa drivers at startup     gromi a00pd                                          hintmattbabaisuedu

  hi there  i am very interested in rayshade 000 i have managed to make a chessboard for rayshade unfortunately i still have to do the knight horse any ideas i am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces the board is marble unfortunately black wont work very well for the one side anybody with ideas for nice surfaces  i would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield command unfortunately the manual is very vague about this and i dont have craig kolbs email address anybody with ideas because this is essential for my next venture into raytracing  where should i post the finished chessboard  is there anybody else using rayshade on nonunix systems  how fast does unix render  thanks  rayshade is the best program for people who loves graphics but have no artistic talent

    hi netters   i am currently doing some investigations on developable surface  can anyone familiar with this topic give me some information or sources  which can allow me to find some infomation of developable surface  thanks for your help   abel  h0000000hkuxahkuhk  a developable surface is st you can lay it or roll it flat on the plane it may require you to give it a cut though  eg a cylinder a cone a plane of course or any surface or patch having vanishing gaussian intrinsic curvature ie with singular hessian the matrix of 0nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch are developable in more technical words a developable surface is locally isometric to a plane at all points   think also of the sphere or the earth which in a nondevelopable whatever ways you cut it you will not be able to lay flat any pieces of it its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing  for more details on this look at any book on differential geometry which treats surfaces 0d manifolds eg m do carmos book  bookcarmo00differential   author       do carmo manfredo p   title        differential geometry of curves and surfaces   year         0000   publisher    prenticehall   note         000 pages  enjoy   frederic leymarie  leyfremcrcimmcgilledu mcgill university electrical eng dept mcrcim    tel 000 0000000 0000 university st montreal qc canada h0a 0a0  fax  000 0000000  
                                im working upon a game using an isometric perspective similar to that used in populous  basically you look into a room that looks similar to the following                               xxxx                          xxxxx   xxxx                      xxxx    x       xxxx                  xxxx        x           xxxx              xxxx     0      xxxx     0      xxxx              x           xxxx    xxxx           x              x       xxxx            xxxx       x              x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x              xxxx              0          xxxx                  xxxx                 xxxx                      xxxx            xxxx                          xxxx    xxxx                              xxxx  the good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision   since your viewpoint is always the same the routines can be hardcoded for a particular vantage  in my case wall twos rising edge has a slope of 00 im also using mode x 000x000  ive run into two problems im sure that other readers have tried this before and have perhaps formulated their own opinions  0 the routines for drawing walls 0  0 were trivial but when i ran a packedplanar image through them i was dismayed by the jaggies  im now considered some antialiasing routines speed is not really necessary is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed thus being assured of nice image or is this too much of a burden  0 wall 0 presents a problem the algorithm i used tends to overly distort the original  i tried to decide on paper what pixels go where and failed has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape  currently i take    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  and produce                           0  0  0  0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  0  0  0  0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  0 00 00 00             00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                         00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                                     00 00 00 00  line 0 follows the slope  line 0 is directly under line 0 line 0 moves up a line and left 0 pixels  line 0 is under line 0 this fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels  but it causes distortions  has anyone come up with a better way perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed  are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective i was planning on having hidden plane removal by using zbuffering locations are stored in xyz form   for those of you who noticed the top lines of wall 0 and wall 0 are parallel with its bottom lines  this is why there appears to be an optical illusion ie it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube depending on your mood  there are no vanishing points this simplifies the drawing code for objects which dont have to change size as they move about in the room  ive decided that this approximation is alright since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing  hopefully the context of the picture ie chairs on the floor torches hanging on the walls will dispell any visual ambiguity  thanks in advance for any help    till next time                o   o                                 v o v     emailpinkytamuedu   sam  inala                   v

  i need information on the display postscript strokeadjust feature this feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices  the postscript literature explains the process to some extent  they also give an example of how to emulate strokeadjust in postscript environments where it is absent  the suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate  newcoord  round oldcoord  000  000  doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in 00  from reading i thought that what they might actually do is  newcoord  trunc oldcoord  0  0  000  this results in all the coordinates ending in either 000 or 000  whichever is closer  by doing some actual comparisons with display postscript i find that neither of these is what dps really uses  since i like how the dps result looks better than how my stuff looks id like to know if anyone who knows how dps does it is willingable to tell me  thanks  steve squeegeeworldstdcom

   yes i am aware coreldraw exports in scodal  but if you try to export in scodal with a bitmap it will say something like cannot export if anyone out there knows a way around this i am all ears  i think one not ideal solution is to use the tracing utility cant remember the name sorry included in the corel draw sw pack  it can convert bitmaps to corel art format  these can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap result  the file is completely in corel format and can be scodaled no problem  but the slight problem with this which makes the solution less than idea is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced  straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments  so the scodal taking much longer to image  the obvious solution is timeconsuming  stripping out the extra points by hand using corel  ouch ive done it a few times   i was just wondering if there was anything out there that just did the bitmap to scodal part a tad cheaper                     jeff lyall  as i say if you dont mind the problems go via the route bitmap  corel via trace  hand trimming using corel  combine with main corel pic via import  scodal  cheers    toby                                           toby freeman                          glasgow university                  freemantukacglasgowdcs

   i was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a 00bit graphics computerimage processing system  i seem to remember it being called image or something akin to that  anyway he claimed it had 00bit color  a 00bit alpha channel  thats 00 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  specifically the 00bit color  thats 000 trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  is this an antialiasing thing  or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor  also to settle a bet with my roommate what are sgis flagship products  i know of iris indigo and crimson but what are the other ones and which is their topoftheline sadly i have access to none of them  just a dec 000000  sigh  eric oehler oehlerpicardcswiscedu

   i am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a postscript type 0 or truetype font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 0d scanline renderer   i have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system well i now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so i would like to have some of my questions answered before i jump into the deep end  the main problem i face is how to use the evenodd or nonwinding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons for example in the letter o there are two outlines  0 the outside outline which is clockwise truetype font 0 the inside outline which is counterclockwise  one common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest this is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes the renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges  i do not want to use this simplistic system since  0 it will not handle all outline fonts properly it is not a simple matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some fancy fonts 0 it does not properly handle the evenodd or nonwinding rules  from my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids as is done by the postscript and truetype font rasterizers these trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 0d scanline renderer  my question is are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer i am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons  another question for those in the know what is the best algorithm to create bevelled andor offset curves for font outlines i have a dozen papers on these subjects but i cant tell which method is the best to implement  thanks for any pointers   rob lansdale    robert lansdale  000 0000000       dynamic graphics project internet lansddgptorontoedu        computer systems research institute uucp   uunetdgptorontoedulansd university of toronto bitnet  lansddgputoronto           toronto ontario m0s 0a0 canada

    hi all i am looking into methods i can use to turn my linux based bbs into a full color graphical bbs that supports pc mac linux and amiga callers  originally i was inspired by the naplps graphics standard a summary of  which hit this group about 0 weeks ago  following up on software availability of naplps supporting software i find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being pp0 which runs soley on msdos machines leaving mac and amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the bbs i know i wouldnt  next most interesting possibility is to port mgr to pc mac amiga i know there is an old version of a mac port on bellcorecom that doesnt work under system 0 but i cant seem to find the source anywhere to see if i can patch it  is there a color version of mgr for linux  i know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but i misplaced it  does anyone on this group know if mgr as been ported to pc or amiga  i cant seem to send a message to the mgr channel without it bouncing  does anyone have any other suggestions for a linux based gui bbs   thanks in advan

   yeah corel draw and wordperfect presentations pretty limited here too since theres no not really such thing as a decent raster to vector conversion program this tracing technique is about it  simple stuff like bw logos etc do pretty well while more complicated stuff goes haywire  i suspect even though i dont write code that a good bitmapped to vector conversion program would probably be as big as most of these application softwares were using  but even so how come one hasnt been written to my knowledge  i mean even hijaak one of the commercial industry standards of file conversion hasnt attempted it yet    mac mcdougald                      any opinions expressed herein   the photography center             are not necessarily actually  univ of tenn knoxville 00000     are almost certainly not those  macutkvxutkedu                  of the university of tennessee   macutkvxbitnet                        0000000000                     things are more like they are now       0000000000 fax                  than theyve ever been before

  ok with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime the effects of scaling and so on i thought id do some more tests  first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic the movie i had been using only had 00 frames in it it was a version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor i decided something a little longer would give closer to realworld results for better or for worse  i pulled out a copy of 0000 a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie theres a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized a portion of about 00 seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only 0 frames per second to give a total of 000 frames  i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 000000 pixels with the spigot card in my centris 000 quartersize resolution from a pal source i then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor keeping the 0 fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled to 000000 resolution the other at 000000 resolution i used the default 000 quality setting in premiere 000 and specified a key frame every ten frames  i then ran the 000000 movie through the same raw speed test program i used for the results id been reporting earlier  result a playback rate of over 00 frames per second  thats right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie just for fun i copied the 000000 movie to my external hard disk a quantum lp000s and ran it from there this time the playback rate was only about 00 frames per second obviously the 000mb internal hard disk also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback  i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors and tried playing back the 000000 movie scaled to 000000 size this time the playback speed was over 00 fps clearly the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 00 in action not 00 id try my tests with quicktime 00 but i dont think its entirely compatible with my centris and system 00  unscaled the playback rate for the 000000 movie was over 000 fps  the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 000000 movie with preferred playback rates greater than 00 and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer ie with quicktimes normal synchronized playback a preferred rate of 00  00 fps didnt work too well the playback was very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved 00 fps with ease i cant believe that quicktimes synchronization code would add this much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac systems task switching  a preferred rate of 00  00 fps seemed to work fine i couldnt see any evidence of stutter at 00  00 fps i think i could see slight stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell  i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even more  lawrence doliveiro                       fone 0000000000 computer services dept                     fax 0000000000 university of waikato            electric mail ldowaikatoacnz hamilton new zealand    00 00 00 s 000 00 0 e gmt0000

  howdy all  oehleryarcswiscedu wonko the sane writes  i was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a 00bit graphics computerimage processing system  i seem to remember it being called image or something akin to that  anyway he claimed it had 00bit color  a 00bit alpha channel  thats 00 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  specifically the 00bit color  thats 000 trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  is this an antialiasing thing  or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor  hmm 00 bit aye well it beats a 00bit design for thee sake of ellegance 00 bit means 00 bits per primary colour the 000 nr of colours is a bit misleading it makes more sense to see it as 00000 possible shades of pure red this might actually make some sense since 000 shades of red 00 bit colours  may produce visible jumps in intensity then again a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way  of doing colour graphics because it leaves ya such a tidy and fast program code  take care  bram    flying is a nack the trick is     bram stolk stolkfwiuvanl        to throw yourself at the ground     dept of maths  computer science   and miss   douglas adams        university of amsterdam                                               no i dont use mswindoze i prefer linux

  macutkvxbitnet richard j mcdougald writes  since theres no not really such thing as a decent raster to vector  conversion program this tracing technique is about it  simple stuff  like bw logos etc do pretty well while more complicated stuff goes  haywire  the first and only thing ive ever tried to autotrace was a piece of a uscg nautical chart using adobe illustrator 00  i wanted to get the outline of the coast for western long island sound  i was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did  i suspect what i gave it was a very difficult thing not only is the coastline very irregular but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines not only lattitude and longitude but loran grids as well  the most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast  i think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say no dummy youre going the wrong way  steve reisberg a friend of mine a few years back did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage virii a good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles this is essentially the same problem that illustrator tries to solve with its autotrace tool  in some respects the problem steve worked on was harder since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step but a step on which all future analysis depended  however in other respects it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight clean and well imaged you dont always have that freedom autotracing real life images  in any case it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case   steve is no longer with us  he and his wife disappeared while on vacation in hawaii a couple of years after they graduated  their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area  while no bodies were ever found they are presumed to have been the victim of some sort of fall or accident in the woods   roy smith roynyuedu hippocrates project department of microbiology coles 000 nyu school of medicine 000 first avenue new york ny 00000 this never happened to bart simpson

  ospreyux0csouiucedu lucas adamski writes  in article 0000pdxgateuucp idrrigelcspdxedu ian d romanick writes what kind of polygons  shaded  texturemapped  hm  more comes into play with fast routines than just polygons  it would be nice to know exaclty what system vga is a start but what processor and a few of the specifics of the implementation  you need to give  more info if you want to get any answers p  i dont want texture mapped cause if i did id asked for them   just a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons  as for the processor itd be for a minimum of a 000 maybe 000 if i cant find a good one for 000s ideally i want a polyn function that can clip to a userdefined viewport and write to an arbitrary location in memory  of course the chances of  ok it is for a game that is 0d and you have listed the characteristics  that you are looking for i think you may have left out a few  important parameters  the polygons are all convex  they have less than n sides you are drawing meshes walls doors etc  i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave  self intersecting polygons  this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that  simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line complex figure 0 type polygons can be a bit trickier  the less than n sides specification especially if it is a very small  number like 0 or 0 allow othe optimisations to be made  thus for a high speed game application i think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons    finding something like that are pretty remote so i guess id need the source with it  oh and i guess it would need to be in asm otherwise itd be too slow  ive seen some polygon routines in c and theyve all been waaay too slow  its for a 0d vector graphics program  ive been hunting high and low  it may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms if you limit yourself to 0 or four sided simple convex polygons i think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a  asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be   for a polyn function in asm and i cant find one anywhere that i can use ive found one or two polyn functions but my asm is pretty bad so i wont even try to rewrite them  lucas

angle  the obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination this is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination  instead loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the reverse transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the source this method is quite general and can be used for any onetoone 0d mapping not just rotation  you can add antialiasing by doing subpixel sampling  however there is a much faster method with antialising included which involves doing three shear operations  the method was originally created for the im raster toolkit see below an implementation is also present in pbmplus  reference a fast algorithm for raster rotation by alan paeth

messages saying i cant ftp could someone mail this to me  there are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message  see item 00 below for details on some  also the newsgroup altgraphicspixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this  you may find useful information there   0 format documents for tiff iff biff nff off fits etc  you almost certainly dont need these  read the above item 0 on free image manipulation software  get one or more of these packages and look through them  chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there  but if you still want one of the format documents many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhofcsriceedu in directory pubgraphicsformats  these files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct this archive includes pixel formats and two and threedimensional object formats  the future of this archive is uncertain at the moment as mark hall foocsriceedu will apparently no longer be maintaining it  a second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by quincey koziol koziolncsauiucedu  the latest version exists at ftpncsauiucedu in miscfileformatsgraphicsformats  apparently neither of these is complete you might want to check both  fits stands for flexible image transport system its a file format most often used in astronomy  despite the name it can contain not only images but other things as well  there is a regular monthly fits basics and information posting on sciastrofits  read it if you want to know more    0 converting between vector formats  a lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript or macdraw to cgm or whatever  it is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 0  converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel  the basic objects are the same for all image formats  this is not so for vector formats the basic objects  circles ellipses dropshadowed patternfilled roundcornered rectangles etc  vary from one format to another except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a onetoone conversion between vector formats  there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftppscedu  the contributor states that it runs on unix mswindows and possibly the mac a better more specific blurb would be most welcome  on the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another as far as i know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been posted to compsourcesmisc  check the index on your nearest archive site  a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image  from postscript to sun raster format or hpgl to x00 bitmap  for example some of the commercial postscript clones for pcs allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer  also the postscript interpreters in the next box and in suns x00news can be used to render to a file if youre clever  but in general the answer is no  however if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial  gnu ghostscript from the fsf  current version 000 includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a postscript to ppm  or a postscript to gif filter  it implements essentially all of postscript level 0 and alot of display postscript and level 0   00 how to get pixar films  the various john lasseter  pixar computer animated shorts are

consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity  if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the polygon  if the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges  this idea is known in the trade as the jordan curve theorem see eric haines article in glassners ray tracing book above for more information including treatment of special cases  another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon  if the sum is 0 pi the point is inside if the sum is 0 the point is outside  however this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly  code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in the ray tracing news vol 0 no 0 available from princetonedu pubgraphicsrtnewsrtnv0n0z   00

   a good reason which is why many companies use it for 00 bits  pixel is so you can use double buffering for animating scenes  ie you have 0  00bit planes you write to the one in the background and then flip   the entire screen updates to the second imageplane the screen updates  in one refresh and you dont see different objects appearing in the order  that theyre drawn as in the cadmacdraw effect now your ready to update  the image that used to be in the foreground  steve thssstbiitmaxiitedu  irisiitedu  about the sg product line who can even keep track nowadays every co seems to as their ads  press releases claim redefine computing etc etc as we know it with each new product progress and competition are great but who wants to invest in a system thats obsolete by the time it reaches your desk

  i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave  self intersecting polygons  this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that  simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line complex figure 0 type polygons can be a bit trickier  it is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concavemulti outline algorithm but not tremendously faster  i spent awhile implementing and optimizing both flavors and the convex turned out about 00 faster  this is all c on hp parisc the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as fast as possible as far as i could tell  for any sort of game the database to render is known ahead of time and can be made all convex  definitely the way to go  ps sorry but my code cannot be made public domain jesse   jesse lackey    0deye inc ithaca ny    jesseeyecom    000 0000000

  chris herringshaw tdawsonenginumichedu wrote  concerning the proposed newsgroup split i personally am not in favor of  doing this  i learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading  this group from code to hardware to algorithms  i just think making 0  different groups out of this is a wate and will only result in a few posts  a week per group  i kind of like the convenience of having one big forum  for discussing all aspects of graphics  anyone else feel this way  just curious  yes i also like knowing where to go to ask a question without getting hell for putting it in the wrong newsgroup  i am also against splitting the group the traffic will decrease on any given subject but the required net bandwidth will increase because of multiply crosspostings  i just went through this with another group i continuously read it is now almost at the point where it is no longer worth reading  strongly suggest not doing this  dave rogers  
  i have some color gifs which i would like to archive in a much smaller size using a grayscale palette of 00 shades the quantization to 00 grays introduces some ugly bands in the pictures which can be nicely eliminated by dithering up to now i have used xv to process the images but now i would like to automate the procedure  the problem is that xv cant i think convert images automatically and the obvious alternative pnmplus ppmquant and pnmdither dont even get close to xvs quality pnmdither apparently dithers in rgb even though the images are in grayscale the dithering routine in xv seems to use the natural image colors for the dither is this or any similar routine available in the public domain if so where     niclas mattsson exjob00mathchalmersse

  i have a question about recursive backward raytracing  when an incident ray i strikes an object at point p first the normal n is calculated light rays are calculated l0 to ln  where n is the number of light sources  these being the light rays that do not intersect with anything the reflected ray r and the transmitted ray t is calculated from the formulae  calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colours  along the rays r and t as rcol and tcol each object has its own colour ocol and each light source has licol 0  i  n  the question is    how do you combine rcol tcol ocol and all the licols to get   the correct resulting colour to return along the i ray  all colours are defined as strucures records having r g b components between 0 and 0  if anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints   adrian secchia  asecchiacsuctacza

    does anyone know of software that will allow you to convert coreldraw cdr files containing bitmaps to scodal as this is the only format our bureaus filmrecorder recognises  corel draw will do it version 0 onwards if you have version 0 perhaps an upgrade is in order  another alternative would be to use a different bureau that can take postscript   chris lilley  technical author itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit manchester computing centre oxford road  manchester uk  m00 0pl                        internet cclilleymccacuk  voice 00 000 000 0000  fax 00 000 000 0000 janet cclilleyukacmcc

    recent discussion about xvs problems were held in some newsgroup here is some text users of xv might find interesting  i have also minor ideas for 00bit xv email me for them  deleted for space basically complaints that xv is an 0 bit program and that making several modifications to the rgb sliders is slow because of screen updates  in reverse order  0 try clicking in the autoapply box to switch it off then make your mods then click on apply there is no problem as stated it has already been solved if you look carefully  0 yes xv is an 0 bit program this is not a bug you can edit individual pallette entries or do global colour changes crop scale etc clearly the program must save out the altered image else all your work would be thrown away so yes it saves out 0 bit images  of course  xv can import 00 bit images and quantises them down to 0 bits this is a handy facility not a bug  how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 00 bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated  if you want to do colour editing on a 00 bit image you need much more powerfull software  which is readily available commercially  and lastly jpeg is a compression algorithm it can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth again this is not a bug it is a way of saving disk space   later   chris lilley  technical author itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit manchester computing centre oxford road  manchester uk  m00 0pl                        internet cclilleymccacuk  voice 00 000 000 0000  fax 00 000 000 0000 janet cclilleyukacmcc

    yes i am aware coreldraw exports in scodal version 0 did it quite well apart from a few hassles with radial fills version 0 revb is better but if you try to export in scodal with a bitmap image included in the drawing it will say something like cannot export scodal with bitmap at least it does on my version  oh ok then sorry for misunderstanding   if anyone out there knows a way around this i am all ears  temporal images make a product called filmpak which converts autocad plots to scodal postscript to scodal and now gif to scodal but it costs 000 and i was just wondering if there was anything out there that just did the bitmap to scodal part a tad cheaper  maybee you should persuade your burea that for only 000 they can become much more competitive taking input from autocad postscript andgif as well as scodl   seriously this sounds like something the bureau should have or find another bureau you should not be the one buting this software   chris lilley  technical author itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit manchester computing centre oxford road  manchester uk  m00 0pl                        internet cclilleymccacuk  voice 00 000 000 0000  fax 00 000 000 0000 janet cclilleyukacmcc

   the sane writes  i was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a 00bit graphics computerimage processing system  i seem to remember it being called image or something akin to that  anyway he claimed it had 00bit color  a 00bit alpha channel  thats 00 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  specifically the 00bit color  thats 000 trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  is this an antialiasing thing  or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor  well 00 bit colour could be for improved resolution but 00 bits per channel seems like a bit excessive i have seen a paper that quoted 00 bits per channel of 00 bits for computational precision more than that would seem to be wasted  perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range  rgb is a cube so it is a compact encoding  most likely however is that there are two separate 00 bit 0 bits per component frame buffers this set up called double buffering allows a complex 0d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer containing the previous frame is displayed this makes for smoother animation  sadly i have access to none of them  just a dec 000000  sigh  well hey if you want to brag about numbers the 0000 range can take a pxg turbo card with 00 bits per pixel full double buffering two 00 bit buffers a 00 bit z buffer and an extra 00 bit buffer for off screen image storage  mind you the card costs more than your workstation   chris lilley  technical author itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit manchester computing centre oxford road  manchester uk  m00 0pl                        internet cclilleymccacuk  voice 00 000 000 0000  fax 00 000 000 0000 janet cclilleyukacmcc

   anyone who thinks that tiff is too complex hasnt dealt with cgm asn0 cda dca sgml or any one of a number of other very successful file format  people seem perfectly capable dealing with these others  dealing with the format of tiff is frankly less difficult than dealing with the dct lzw and fax encoding of the image data  the majority of the libraries which deal with tiff are dedicated to these other issues rather than with simply decoding the tags and parameters  perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather simpleminded formats such as gif pcx and bmp but to suggest that tiff is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous  that doesnt mean that gif isnt fine but dont even thing about using it in many instances  gif is very nice for use in lowend photos applications and for screen grabs and such but it would never do for highvolume or highresolution systems  fax is nice but it doesnt do color and gif doesnt do bw all that well jpeg is nice for highresolution color but is slow for lowend  the advantage tiff brings to the table is its ability to handle all these situations and then some  naturally its more complex but ild rather propose tiff imaging solutions over imaging systems based on having to deal with 00 file formats anyday  you may find that tiff is too complicated for your personal tastes but please dont wrail against its complexity  the complexity it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and doesnt come close to the complexity found in most commercially viable file formats   if were in philosophical arguments against complexity lets all go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length encoding

from us as well   as a huge usercontributed library    feature description    hips  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research   system  development  and  teaching it  handles  sequences  of  images   movies  in precisely the same manner as single frames    programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations filtering convolution fourier and other transform   processing edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation digital   image compression and transmission  methods noise generation and image   statistics computation over 000 such  image transformation programs   have been developed  as a result almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently additionally hips allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines   new users   become effective using hips on their first day    hips features images that are  selfdocumenting   each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image   hips includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of unix   filters  it comes complete with source  code  online manual   pages and online documentation    host configuration requirements    originally  developed at  new  york  university  hips  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available  it runs under the unix operating   system  it is modular  and  flexible provides automatic documentation   of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment   hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and   microvax sun apollo  masscomp  ncr tower iris ibm at etc   for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and   adage ikonas image processors and the sun0 sun0 sun 0 and   sun000i consoles  we also  supply  usercontributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and

adapted for other  image  display devices   because 00 of hips is machine independent    availability    hips has proven itself a highly flexible  system  both as  an   interactive  research tool and for more production oriented tasks it   is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses hips   is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format either reel toreel or   sun  cartridge

working   for alex goetz  you might try contacting them if you already have idl   or would be willing to buy it  its a few thousand dollars american i   expect for idl and the other should be free  those are the general   purpose packages ive heard of besides what terramar has   sips was written for aviris imagery  im not sure how general purpose   it is  you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask  i   have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification you can compute an image using selected components  ive   used it on 00 megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best   speed you need an external dsp card  it will work without it but large   images take quite a while 0000 times as long to process  thats a   freebie if you want it    my  favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems   inc  idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its   programming language is very strong and easy  very pascallike it   handles the numbercrunching very well also personally i like doing   the numbercrunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even   excel on the mac if its not too hairy then bringing it over to nih   image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldnt handle and the speed and ease of use   compared to iraf was incredible by the way its mostly astronomical   image processing which ive been doing this means image enhancement   cleaning up bad linespixels and some other traditional image   processing routines then for example taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line i choose with the mouse then doing a curve   fit to that line which i might do like in kaleidagraph    for idl call research systems  for pvwave call precision visuals and  for sips call university of colorado  boulder  from what i can  understand you can get packaged

applications   host configuration requirements    it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun   though there  were rumors there are always rumors that the software   would be  ported to pc and possibly a sun environment  pci    a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes   an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i   forget  the software is available in versions for msdos unix   workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly   other platforms by now  i use the vms version    the pci software consists of several classesgroupspackages of   utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci   database disk file  the tape io package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape   formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file   this is the only package i use or know much about  other packages can   display data from the pci database to one or another of several   pcisupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer eg an epsontype   dotmatrix graphics printer  you might be more spe cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and   fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg   multiply channel 0 by 0 add channel 0 and store as channel 0 and   god only knows what all else  theres a lot  i dont have and dont   use these so cant say much about them you only buy the packages your   particular applicationinterest calls for    each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from   a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default   directory  some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations  the standard pci environment contains a   scripting language very similar to ibmpc basic but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  in vms i can also   invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure  theres   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the pci   data structures database file parameter file    the pci software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but   requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the   level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well  for instance the tape io package offers a   utility for reading headerless multiband what adobe photoshop on the   macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different   interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphicarts industrys ct0t format would probably i havent tried   handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what   youre doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start   over  its worth noting that the pci database file is designed to   contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of   other information i observe that a remotesensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude   longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this   can go into the pci database    i believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  on vax   systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific   thirdparty display systems the name goulddeanza seems to come to   mind  one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vctq qbus   00bit directcolor display subsystem  pci software could be overkill   in your case it seems designed for the very high end   applicationsusers ie those for whom a macpc largely doesnt suffice   although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  its   probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which   does a lot of its landresource management via remote sensing i believe   the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these   areas  spam spectral analysis manager    back in 0000 jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis   manager which got a fair amount of use at the time  that was designed   for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data  000 pixels   across by  000 lines by  000 bands a modified version has since   been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging   spectrometer which uses much larger images    spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and   ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays   actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   stretching  spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering    the original spam uses x or sunview to display  the aviris version may   require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame   buffer  i can refer you to people if youre interested  pcw requires x   for display  map ii    among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley  clrview    clrview is a

  im asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in zbuffering that ive encountered in 0 different pex implementations  i cant find any discussion of this problem in any resources i can lay hands on eg the compwindowsxpex faq gaskinss pexlibprogrammingmanual vendors documentation  im posting this article by itself on compgraphics and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on compwindowsxpex  the problem is hard to describe without pictures hence this article is longish  if you can run pexlib 0x programs and are interested i encourage you to build and run the test program in compwindowsxpex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it  it depends on the utility code from the above gaskins book instructions for fetching it via anonymous ftp are given  the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching artifacts resulting from the use of zbuffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas  the interpolated z values along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area  because of this its a tossup whether the zbuffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed visually the result tends to be a dashedline effect even though the line is supposed to be solid  using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one for the areas and one for the lines  the pex structures or immediate mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines  the result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines  this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards ie smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas  this means that when a point is transformed to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias  i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the zbuffer typically from 0 to 00000 if not 00000000 ie 00 or 00 bit zbuffers therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching  but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0000 to 0000 of the range  empirically its worst when the npc z component of the slope of the surface is high ie when it appears more or less edgeon to the viewer  its as if only 0 or 0 bits of the zbuffer have any dependable meaning  this amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through areas which they are supposed to lie behind  ive observed the problem on both hewlettpackard and digital workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree  the test program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 0x implementation this version is known to compile and run on an hpux system with pex 00  open questions     0 why does this happen           am i configuring the pex view table wrongly           is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines             as opposed to areas eg pixel centers versus corners which             could be corrected for           are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their             interpolators           something else     0 what to do about it           can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision             in zbuffered hlhsr           is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching             artifacts           am i just out of luck  any help would be immensely appreciated     dave gorgen                         internet gorgenannarborappliconslbcom applicon inc                                 gorgenaaaca0sinetslbcom ann arbor michigan usa               uucp uunetsharkeyapplgagorgen  
   now i have a couple raytracing questions just so you know im using povray 00 both msdos and unix and im generating targa files of varying size  0 ok so i can view these wonderful pictures on my screen  whats the best way  to get them on to paper  would it be possible to take it to kinkos and have   them make an actual picture on paper from it  0 i was thinking about making a small animation bit with different raytraced  frames  is this a bad idea  any tricks to it  0    how would i get a sequence of targa files made into an animation  that i could put on a videotape  is there a cheap way  
   could somebody please email me some info on either what gif or iff file formats are or where i can get such info   thanx  rtarazwpiwpiedu

   hello i have some problem in converting tga filegenerated by povray to rle file when i convert i do not get any warning message but if i use xloadimagegetx00 something is wrong  edited  i know that i need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm but i do not spend time to install them even i do not want to generate rgb from povray and then convert them to rle if possiblergb to rle works but it will mess up my directory with so many files and it needs 0 more steps to finally convert to rle file say cat  rawtorle  rleflip  does any body out there have same experienceproblems    well for starters why use rle files  you might have a specific program that needs them ok but i tend to convert straight to jpeg format thus a 00meg 00bit targa file becomes a 00k or less 00bit jpeg  the latest versions of xv 000  and xloadimage 000 both handle jpeg files and the best way to convert to jpeg is with the cdjpeg suit  even at 00 quality you cant see the difference the jpeg is way smaller than anything else even an 0bit gif  laterish craig        i didnt do it nobody saw me do it            you cant prove anything                        craighumphreystargateactrixgennz ccccccccchumphrecompvuwacnz

   i saw an imaging program some time ago on an amiga that had cross sobel and roberts filters for edge detection   can anybody direct me to these algorithms  ok never heard of cross filters but roberts prewitt and sobel filters are standard spatial masks for edge detection  highpass filtering does a good job of detecting edges too  a good reference for all sorts of general digital image processing is the book digital image processing by rafael c gonzalez and richard e woods  addisonwesley publishing co 0000 isbn 0000000000  ive used this source to do the above filters and many other things as a grad project  not too dificult to do  the worst part is loading in the images from tiffgififfilbmwhatever    wayne rigby rigbycsunredu  
  greetings this is a general call for information regarding image processing i am looking for any material related to the field and am also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the field in particular source code for general use packages  i already have several texts on the subject but would appreciate more input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself im not mathematically literate ie i dont have a degree in mathematics so any material that is suggested i would prefer that it was not mathematically intensive  the best book i have found on the subject at the moment is  practical digital image processing by rhys lewis isbn 0000000000 published by ellis horwood c0000  likewise i am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate image processing techniques so far i have xv and khoros for unix dcview 00 for the ibm pc and various related smatterings of c code to help describe topics like contrasting dithering image enhancement via convolution etc  if anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software pertinent to this area or better still if they could tell me where i am most likely to find it on the aarnet internet if i can i would prefer source code in c or turbo pascal that includes some image processing codealgorithms that i can readily altermanipulate for the purposes of demonstration it would be most helpful  all the above information will contribute to my postgraduate studies and will be liberally used in my paper and seminar on the subject             thanks in advance vance ashlin           diploma advanced computing   thinking is dangerous subversive mindnumbing and leads you astray  ashlinironbarkucnveduau i000000redgumucnveduau

tests     first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic the movie i had been using only had 00 frames in it it was a    version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor    i decided something a little longer would give closer to realworld results    for better or for worse     i pulled out a copy of 0000 a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv    a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie theres a sequence where    the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized    a portion of about 00 seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space    station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only    0 frames per second to give a total of 000 frames     i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 000000 pixels with the spigot    card in my centris 000 quartersize resolution from a pal source i then    imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor    keeping the 0 fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled    to 000000 resolution the other at 000000 resolution i used the default    000 quality setting in premiere 000 and specified a key frame every ten    frames     i then ran the 000000 movie through the same raw speed test program i used    for the results id been reporting earlier     result a playback rate of over 00 frames per second     thats right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie just for fun i copied the 000000 movie to my external hard    disk a quantum lp000s and ran it from there this time the playback rate    was only about 00 frames per second obviously the 000mb internal hard disk    also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback     i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors and tried playing back the 000000 movie scaled to 000000    size this time the playback speed was over 00 fps clearly the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 00 in    action not 00 id try my tests with quicktime 00 but i dont think its    entirely compatible with my centris and system 00     unscaled the playback rate for the 000000 movie was over 000 fps     the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 000000 movie with    preferred playback rates greater than 00 and seeing how well they played    from within movieplayer ie with quicktimes normal synchronized playback    a preferred rate of 00  00 fps didnt work too well the playback was    very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved 00 fps with    ease i cant believe that quicktimes synchronization code would add this    much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac systems task    switching     a preferred rate of 00  00 fps seemed to work fine i couldnt see    any evidence of stutter at 00  00 fps i think i could see slight    stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell     i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also    improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance    even more

zealand    00 00 00 s 000 00 0 e gmt0000   im afraid i missed the start of this thread but there are three factors that can significantly affect quicktimes playback speed that you may want to take into account  0 playback bit depth things are fastest when you play a movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for this is usually 0 or 00 bit but other depths are of course possible  0 type of scaling qt is optimized for double size scaling other scaling factors hit peformance much harder  0 playback window position movieplayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default im not sure about premiere  any combination of those can radically alter playback performance  image size is of course another biggie  giving the movie player lots of ram can also make a real difference  forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread  peter lee      peter e lee software conductor                         specular international inc

  could somebody please email me some info on either what gif or iff file formats are or where i can get such info  well gif stands for graphics interchange format and was put forth by compuserve back in 0000 or so  it was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system  gif is limited to 0 bit color but has a built in compression scheme lzw  iff is not really a graphics format but rather a standard way to package images sounds animations text or whatever into one file  iff was created by electronic arts i do believe i could be wrong for the amiga it was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the amiga the most common image format for the iff package is an ilbm interleaved bitmap but many others exist  this format supports 00 bit color images  information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at zamenhofcsriceedu in the directory pubgraphicsformats taken from the faq for this news group    wayne rigby rigbycsunredu

     david gorgen writes   im asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low  apparent precision in zbuffering that ive encountered in 0 different  pex implementations  i cant find any discussion of this problem in any  resources i can lay hands on eg the compwindowsxpex faq gaskinss  pexlibprogrammingmanual vendors documentation      the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching  artifacts resulting from the use of zbuffering with polylines that are  coplanar with filled areas  the interpolated z values along a line will  differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values  across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with  vertices of the area  because of this its a tossup whether the  zbuffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed  visually the result tends to be a dashedline effect even though the  line is supposed to be solid   using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly  different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one  for the areas and one for the lines  the pex structures or immediate  mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in  effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines  the  result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to  attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines   this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used  in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards ie  smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view  table entry used for areas  this means that when a point is transformed  to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than  if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias   i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount  to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the zbuffer  typically from 0 to 00000 if not 00000000 ie 00 or 00 bit zbuffers  therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc  between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix  the stitching   but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0000  to 0000 of the range  empirically its worst when the npc z  component of the slope of the surface is high ie when it appears more  or less edgeon to the viewer  its as if only 0 or 0 bits of the  zbuffer have any dependable meaning  this amount is so great that one  problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through  areas which they are supposed to lie behind   ive observed the problem on both hewlettpackard and digital  workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree  the test  program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 0x implementation  this version is known to compile and run on an hpux system with pex  00   open questions      0 why does this happen            am i configuring the pex view table wrongly            is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines              as opposed to areas eg pixel centers versus corners which              could be corrected for            are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their              interpolators            something else      0 what to do about it            can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision              in zbuffered hlhsr            is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching              artifacts            am i just out of luck   we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstations  i was also shocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 00 bits assuming 00 bit z buffer  this seems huge but is only 0000 of the dynamic range  in those terms it doesnt seem so bad  what is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear due mainly to roundoff i believe  so the polygon is not planar in z but is more like a ruffles potato chip  ditto with lines  when you startend at different xy values the ridges are out of phase resulting in the stitch effect  you have the same problem if you try to draw 0 polygon right on top of another but with different vertices  you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap   example   try polygon 0 000000000 000000000 000000000 000000000       polygon 0 000000000 000000000 000000000 000000000  your implementation is correct  in fact we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons  such as nurbs surfaces with isoparametric lines  without the trick the lines appear stitched as you say  when the application draws linespolygons independently the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting so the application must do it  this is what you have discovered and are doing bravo  note to ibmers  the information given here has been

  im looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound what i want to do is the following  from a fast source eg a cdrom several sound sources are read each having its own defined position and other attributes eg direction etc  given the listeners position and direction the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction  this means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to its incoming direction have to be done for each sound source  i think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle  this impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source  this impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation  additionally some reflection diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation kinda like some radiosity algorithm    have someone done this andor written articles on implementing such a system   please post or mail any answers or comments    torgeir veimo  studying at the university of bergen  im gona wave my freak flag high jimi hendrix  and it would be okay on any other day the police

  does this mean they can either do alpha or stenciling but not both simultaneously  i dont know the answer the to this one although with 0bits i would assume that it was one or the other    stereo supportyesyes  otherboth machines will double buffer or do                                                                    stereo output per window  both have an  auxiliary video output that is rs000a  ntsc and pal same question again does this mean they can either do double buffering or stereo but not both simultaneously  according to the literature it will do quadruple buffering so that you can have double buffered stereo output  brian

  i am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing 0d interactive applications what types of 0d widgets you would like to have in your applications    a 0d widget is usually located in the same scene as other 0d objects of the  application  it may let you   manipulate application data the camera   0d objects in the scene and so on or  view the status of the application or 0d objects   via the widgets shape color position orientation and so on or  do whatever i missed but you think is possible  for example a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball shown as a partially transparent sphere superimposed on the object to be rotated a feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 0 objects  the length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance  a widget can provide both manipulation and feedback  for example the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis   please email me or post your opinions on 0d interaction  the information i gathered will help me design a 0d ui construction tool your help is very much appreciated  tony lau tlaucsubcca msc student dept of computer science

  in article 0rguqoinnrcednaccswineduau alansaturncsswinozau alan christiansen writes i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave  self intersecting polygons  this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that  simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line complex figure 0 type polygons can be a bit trickier  it is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concavemulti outline algorithm but not tremendously faster  i spent awhile implementing and optimizing both flavors and the convex turned out about 00 faster  this is all c on hp parisc the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as fast as possible as far as i could tell  for any sort of game the database to render is known ahead of time and can be made all convex  definitely the way to go   ok thanks for help everyone i still havent found quite what im looking for but ive got finals coming up soon so i have to put all this on hold thanx   lucas

   more people have been asking for information on the kubota graphics workstations so here is some more info on the kenaidenali vs the es freedom   here is the text of a denali vs es freedom done by dh brown associates    denali bears a strong resemblance to evans and sutherlands freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its highlevel design  both products use a parallel array of 00000 processors for geometric computations  both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors  as a result denali and freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality  both design teams also appear to have  similar philosophies with respect to modularity scalability and market penetration  there remain however several important differences between the kpc and es products  evans and sutherland designed freedom as a highend developers dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility  in its favor freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than denali  all freedom systems include a large fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions  the freedom design treats its entire image memory as generalpurpose memory allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of specialpurpose applications  finally es provided freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications  note that kpc is working an auxiliary board for ntsc and pal output that will not require an external video encoder  es programmable output features however will remain much more flexible  the kpc design team in contrast made denali more of an endusers system entry version have better performance range and flexibility than lowend freedom configurations and come in at more realistic mainstream price points  denali does not need as many 00000 modules as freedome because it uses a deeper scanconversion pipeline to support each one resulting in better costperformance characteristics  although both products provide strong support for 0d imaging and volume rendering kpc recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities  denalis configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately and to upgrade them separately as needed  both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack sgis more expensive vgxt and realityengine systems  the only other products to provide this capability  kpc supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy trilinear interpolated mipmapping method  on balance however denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than es for most applications aside from being much more affordable kpc solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more offscreen memory for general graphics data storage  by implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules es foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance  kubota avoids this problem by linking texturing to its frame buffer modules providing a lowercost more scalable solution  hope this helps  brian  ps this was reprinted without permission  for the full text please contact kubota 0000000000

  cclilleymccacuk writes  in article 0rohjcavtcctutfi jk00000lehtoricctutfi kouhia juhana writes  i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 0bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 00bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images  doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to 00bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations  think about what you are saying here the 00 bit image is quantised down to 0 bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the 00 bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour  i suppose you dont know what about we have discussed we discussed about errors in xv 000 which shows images only as 0bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it  so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv  that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didnt tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place  gamma and color corrections are easily done to 00bit image as i presented theres no need make tricks from 0bitquantized image back to 00 bit image   how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 00 bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated  ok youre writing about situation that user want edit images as 00bit and user want edit individual colors  your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit  my solution doesnt work because theres no colormap withing real 00bit image  you see user see 00bit image going back to 0bit is silly   about changing individual colors in 0bitquantizedrasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized  small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image xv allows this feature but i dont recommend to use it with the mentioned type images  moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes in full 00bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have 0bit screen theres need for tricks to get the original 00bit image modified because user dont see full 00bit image theres need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be 0x0 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area  selecting individual color is possible from that  ok i dont have thought very much 00bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention 00bit painting program in 0bit screen   yes again what is was wrong with xv  it saved 0bitquantizedrasterized images as 00bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that also human expect that 00bit will be saved as 00bit image say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work  design error  i have heard xv were designed first for 0bit imagesfiles but it were not good idea to take full 00bit images without making major change to the original design  so even all screen images are 0bit the processed images and saved images could have been 00bit very easily instead of 0bit  before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals  however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesnt solve the problem americans the lift is just an example    well my text may be a bit hard reading hopefully you suggeeded to read it   juhana kouhia

  anyone who thinks that tiff is too complex hasnt dealt with cgm asn0 cda dca sgml or any one of a number of other very successful file format  people seem perfectly capable dealing with these others  well yeah but unlike tiff they all do substantially more than encode rectangular bitmaps  and the others are hardly trouble free  i hear that it is quite common for cgm implementations not to interoperate  the annoying thing about tiff is that is that along with the 00 useful options there are 000 stupid options  the most egregious example is that rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently in all tiff files byte and bit order are options and all tiff readers on all machines no matter what their natural byte order have to be prepared to do byte swapping  there are four slightly different fax formats  again any one of them would have been adequate  rgb images can be stored by pixel or by component complexity without function etc etc  i also note that the tiff doc says that aldus experiments show that lzw reliably compresses as well or better than any of the fax formats suggesting that none of the fax formats are really useful  whats worse a lot of the formats arent even implemented very well eg lzw limits code words to 00 bits while 00 or 00 bits would have provided substantially better compression  and the lzw method compresses bytes rather than pixels  but the absolute worst thing about tiff is that any vendor can register proprietary tiff codes and formats without even publicly documenting them this means that there is no way to write a tiff reader that can reliably read all incoming tiff files  some standard  regards john levine johnliecccambridgemaus spdccimaworldieccjohnl

    could someone explain the difference between tom gaskins two books      o  pexlib programming manual    o  phigs programming manual    why would i want to buy one book vs the other book  i have an 00000  pexlib and phigs as it comes from mit with pex and as is explained in the phigs programming manual are just different apis for the pex protocol which is an extension to the x protocol  so it depends on you what you go to use  advantage of phigs is the protability to other platforms ibm graphigs  sunphigs and the standardized structuring of the 0d objects  advantage of pexlib is the sometimes faster and easier programming for immediate mode graphics because pex is not an exactly mapping of phigs to a prortocol                  o o  oooooo       roland holzapfel       computer     email                          wilhelminenstrasse 0   graphics       holzapfeigdfhgde          0000 darmstadt          center      phone                         germany                 zgdv        00 0000 000000                         this space intentionally left blank                     
   vamilliron  yes intels pci is another local bus standard which can be used for graphics although i believe local buses can be used for other things too  as far as i know though pci local bus  would compete with vesa local bus not the vesa graphics standard but others more enlightened might be able to shed more light on this matter  
   i need a graphics display program that can take as a parameter the name of the file to be displayed then just display that image and then quit  all of the other graphics display programs come up with a menu first or some other silliness  this program is going to be run from within another program  i have lots of memory and vga color  any graphics format will do  has anyone heard of such a beast  keith   keith knudsen notre dame in

  please help  i have an ibmcompatible notebook computer with an lcd vga screen  while i was working with it this morning the screen started to flicker a little which i thought was odd since i do use a surgeprotector for my computer and all peripherals  it only did this for a second and then stopped  i left the room for several minutes and when i returned the screen was completely dim not blank but very very dim  the contrast slider still worked so that i could adjust it to where i could faintly make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely no effect  i was pluggedin at the time ie not using the battery but i still tried switching the battery changing the powersaver features etc etc all to no avail  has anyone else experienced anything like this  if this just means that i need to replace the screen then i guess ill have to but i thought that the death of my lcd screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened  i didnt want to take it in to be repaired before i asked on the net about this because i already know what theyll say yep you gotta have this replaced and its gonna cost you   ive only had the computer for about 00 months  is that a reasonable life cycle for a lcd display  oh i guess i ought to give specifics here the brand is compudyne is this a reputable company its a 000sx  00 mhz i forget the model number exactly and i was too ticked off to write it down before coming in to work today  if anyone can help me please give me any advice you might have  im not opposed to having it replaced but id rather not if its not absolutely necessary  if you wouldnt mind please email me at mikemikukyedu but if youd rather post ill be checking back here in a couple of days  btw if the answer to this question is already in a faq somewhere feel free to flame away but i would ask that you also include the location and name of the faq if you dont mind  thanks in advance for any help  mike mattone mikemikukyedu    
  whats really interesting is that from what i can tell the mis folks in the basement with their es0000 dont seem to be pissed at ibm why  i have no idea  either ibm really does take care of their customers better or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the smaller vendors do  no mis folks have infinite budgets of death and they also get parts of their budget allocated upgrades maintenance and new purchases and a lot of ibm mainframe purchases are actually leases and so is the software  basically the engineers who have tight budgets ie the coders and designers of a company bitch and moan when they drop 00000 on a  sparc 0 only to see a faster machine appear a year later  mis types upgrade once every 000 years and their costs are amortized and depreciated over a longer period and the budget office justifies the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting payroll etc  now if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some reason like payroll and accounts youd sure as hell see every engineer with a new cray on his desktop every year   brian

    in article 0000apr0000000000000nessiemccacuk cclilleymccacuk writes  in article 0rohjcavtcctutfi jk00000lehtoricctutfi kouhia juhana writes  i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 0bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 00bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images  doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to 00bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations  think about what you are saying here the 00 bit image is quantised down to 0 bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the 00 bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour  i suppose you dont know what about we have discussed we discussed about errors in xv 000 which shows images only as 0bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it  look be consistent first you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an 0 bit program as some sort of error  so i post and asy it is not a bug it is meant to be like that  so you post and say it is not a bug you never said it was i have misunderstood etc now you are saying  we discussed about errors in xv 000 which shows images only as 0bit  if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a lot easier    so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv  that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didnt tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place  eh sorry i dont understand what you are saying here i am aware that english is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning but this paragraph defeats me  gamma and color corrections are easily done to 00bit image as i presented theres no need make tricks from 0bitquantized image back to 00 bit image  yes as i originally said global changes are easily possible  but this statement contradicts what you said earlier   i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 0bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 00bit image    how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 00 bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated  ok youre writing about situation that user want edit images as 00bit and user want edit individual colors  your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit  no i dont think so actually   you were talking about loading a 00 bit image into xv by quantising manipulating the colours in the colour editor then somewhow applying these changes to the 00 bit file when you exit xv xv lets you edit individual colours where is this sudden jumping off the topic  my solution doesnt work because theres no colormap withing real 00bit image   yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a 00 bit file   you see user see 00bit image going back to 0bit is silly  i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean  about changing individual colors in 0bitquantizedrasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized  small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image   what are you saying   xv allows this feature but i dont recommend to use it with the mentioned type images  ah now we see thew problem first you want to extend xv to allow editing of 0 bit previews of 00 bit images then i point out problems with this now you are saying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem   moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes   not sure what you are saying here certainly one can make local changes  in full 00bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have 0bit screen theres need for tricks to get the original 00bit image modified because user dont see full 00bit image theres need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be 0x0 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area  selecting individual color is possible from that  yes that is one possible approach i would find a program that took such an approach clumsy however  ok i dont have thought very much 00bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention 00bit painting program in 0bit screen  well here we agree  you have not thought it through very much you dont seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next ok we all have off days  perhaps you should step back and think this one through  yes again what is was wrong with xv  it saved 0bitquantizedrasterized images as 00bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that  as i said in the last post jpeg is a compression algorithm it is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression i fail to see what the problem is you have not proposed any workable alternatives  also human expect that 00bit will be saved as 00bit image   speak for yourself you are the only person i have met or spoken to who having quantised a 00 bit image down to 0 bits expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 0 bit image palette  perhaps that is why you yused the singular  say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same   look next time you import a 00 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel  it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 0 bit image xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 00 bit file you are the only person who claims this is confusing  so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work  design error  is a design error the same as a bug   read my lips xv is a program for viewing and modifying 0 bit images it lets you import other images it shows i would say a good deal of thought about the human interface and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for it makes no false claims  i have heard xv were designed first for 0bit imagesfiles but it were not good idea to take full 00bit images without making major change to the original design  if you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post them so  far you have not done so  so even all screen images are 0bit the processed images and saved images could have been 00bit very easily instead of 0bit  argh after all this a comment like that very easily ok go ahead and code it if it is so easy  or alternatively look up the terms import and nonreversible transformation  before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals  however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesnt solve the problem americans the lift is just an example   i think this is a bit of an exageration  what you are actually saying is you got into a lift elevator if you are in the states   and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up everyone else had no problem now you are trying to sue the manufacturer  well my text may be a bit hard reading   you bet  hopefully you suggeeded to read it  mostly leaving aside the language issue however it betrays some very wooly thinking as you yourself admit which is the same in any language go think some

      i am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program    an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on sgi gl    besides typical touchup tasks such as crop rotate smooth etc    bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs    such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image     the following is the relevant sections from the man page       prerelease of may 0000                                       bit0l  name    bit  bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations  description   bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on   silicon graphics gl as a full color program bit handles images of both   00bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner    as an image viewer bit allows list of images to be displayed in their   original type 00bits or color index in any order and in any of the   many builtin styles of display you can walk up and down the list using   mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the   slideshow  with the pan and zoom features large images can be viewed   in full without being limited by the window or screen size    as an image editor bit performs a large number of image editing and   processing tasks accurately and efficiently it keeps information loss   at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing   subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type   whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion andor quantization of   input images you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into   another  in addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple   geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with   the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take   advantage of the higher printer resolutions eg postscript    bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing   image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence   turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be   accessed by a press of a button and best of all the processed image   will be read back and displayed immediately convolution using exter   nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically   giving great flexibility in processing an image  features    bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a   continuous progress report and once the processing is complete    the processed image will be displayed    current features include    o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of antialiasing     and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color    o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x andor ydirections with     the option of subpixel sampling    o renders text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an     image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving     the text and raster separately such as into a postscript file to     take advantage of a higher printer resolution besides normal text     strings many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as     in tex0 eg alphasmallbeta produces greek alphabet alpha     followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta    o presents graphically the histogram of an image    o performs arbitrary 0to0 pixel transformation  the transformation     function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary     forms further the transformation can be applied to rgb channels     separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of     it many difficult tasks such as thresholding can be accomplished     rather easily by 0to0 transformation in combination with the avai     lability of graphical histograms of the image    o places simple geometric figures sgfs eg arrows circles trian     gles etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at     arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some     user definable coordinate system units with the option of rendering     directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately eg     postscript file all sgfs can be scaled in x and ydirections     independently or simultaneously this is how to get an ellipse from a     circle    o performs edge detection in combination with image histograms and 0     to0 transformation very accurate result can be obtained    o performs histogram equalization    o performs convolution with externally defined square matrices of     arbitrary order    o crops a rectangular portion of an image    o cuts and pastes across images    o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount    o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause     interval between images slideshow    o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels     along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities     or as an intensity vs distance plot    o performs image type conversions    o converts image formats    o smoothes an image special convolution    o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image     back and display it    o modify an individual pixels rgb values    o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the     resulting power spectra    o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this prerelease   supported formats       o  iris rgb native to sgi iris       o  jpegjfif format       o  compuserv gif       o  pnmportable any map including ppm pgm and pbm       o  xbm x window bitmap       o  tiff       o  postscriptwrite only  hardware requirements     any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode including

unpacking  acknowledgement     jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groupss library version 0    forms library developed by mark overmars is used for gui    both jpeg and forms library are included in this release     bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate   images the builtin editing features will satisfy most of   your editing needs in addition the external filter and dynamical   kernel will utilize any program you already have so try it   and you will like it      as always any commentsbug reports are welcome

   and no siggraph 00 has not skipped town  were preparing the best siggraph conference yet  speaking of siggraph i just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for siggraph and reupping of membership in the acm last night and was i ever grossed out  the new prices for membership are almost highway robbery  for example  siggraph basic fee went from 00 last year to 00 this year for the same thing a 000 increase  those facile enough to arrange a trip to the annual conference could reduce this to 00 by selecting siggraph lite which means siggraph is charging an additional 00 or so for the proceedings and the art show catalog essentially  toplas went up 00 in cost way outstripping the current inflation rate  basic sigchi fees remainded the same but whereas before sigchi membership included uist and human factors conferences proceedings these are now an extra cost option  bundling that back into the basic rate equivalent services have gone up 000 in cost  sigois membership cost has up 00 but theyve also split out the computer supported cooperative work conference proceedings that used to be included with membership  adding that cost back in means this sig also has doubled its membership fee  what really galls me is that the acm sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services and tried to make it sound like they were offering new services  but with the exception of a couple like siggraph all the plus services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they dont look so big  but their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 00 more than last year for a 00 increase in services measured by cost not by value and curiously a 00 inflation rate on the publications i got last year  is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as i am  robert reedhome animation ltd0000000000 robertslipknotraincom0000 first court west linn or 00000  shooting yourself in the foot in various languages and systems  motif  you spend days writing a uil description of your foot the   trajectory the bullet and the intricate scrollwork on the ivory handles   of the gun when you finally get around to pulling the trigger the gun   jams

     a great many computer programmers read dr dobbs journal  in a recent issue there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read  it said    theres nothing wrong if microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry  the industry needs an ibm for the 00s    where has the hacker ethic gone  not the cracker ethic which is something entirely different and bad but the hacker ethic which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the handson imperative  why is it that people and corporations like bill gates ibm and intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry  why is it that if a person like myself posts messages to usenet on how to get into the little nooks crannies and idiosyncrasies of a computer system they are not given any useful information by those who know just a badmouthing or are completely ignored  why is it that people like steve jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products  i ask those of you who call yourselves hackers why is this  and further how can you let it go on  it is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world and shall continue to do so for a long time to come  it has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago and has made this world even smaller than it was before  i shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way perpetuating more drivel like the 000 windows and the ibm product line on the computerusing public      that is not to say i am against business per se people who profit off of innovative intelligent creative designs do not bother me  in fact i applaud it that is the american way  but those who manage to sell kludgy uncreative systems to the public and profit off of them are the ones who are the problem  and unfortunately because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity they can keep doing it for a very long time    i put it to you thus  where has the hacker ethic gone  if it still exists where  and if it does exist why are those who call themselves hackers allowing this to perpetuate itself  why are they not creating new innovative interesting ideas to stop the sos from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry    i await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence     pstlbacad0alaskaedu       revenge is a dish best served cold          szechuan death                      khan singh                                                                  star trek ii  the wrath of khan

correct email address to reply to      0  what is jpeg  jpeg pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 0bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   0  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 00bitperpixel color data instead of 0bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 0 mbyte fullcolor file down to 000 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 00 bitspixel 00 million colors instead of 0 or less 000 or fewer colors  if you have only 0bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 0bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 0 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   0  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 00bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 0 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 00 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 000 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 0 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 00 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   0  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 000x000 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 0b  file   size in bytescomments  shipppm0000000  original file in ppm format no compression 00 bits  or 0 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead shipppmz 000000  ppm file passed through unix compress  compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note  other textoriented compressors give similar results shipgif 000000  converted to gif with ppmquant fs 000  ppmtogif  most of the savings is the result of losing color  info gif saves 0 bitspixel not 00  see sec 0  shipjpg00 000000  cjpeg q 00    highest useful quality setting  this is indistinguishable from the 00bit original  at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00    default setting  you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this  from the original even with both onscreen at once shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  this has slight defects if you know what to look  for you could tell its been jpeged without seeing  the original  still as good image quality as many  recent postings in usenet pictures groups shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  jpegs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent  at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some  still ive seen plenty of usenet postings that were  of poorer image quality than this shipjpg0o   0000  cjpeg q 0 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead  blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or  indexing purposes  note that this file is tiny  the compression ratio from the original is 0000   in this case jpeg can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 00 file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   0  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 00 does not mean keep 00 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 00 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 00 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 00 saying q 000 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 00 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 00 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 00 is about right for compressing 00bit images but q 00 to 00 is usually better for converting gifs see section 00 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 0 to 00 is about right  q 0 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 0b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   0  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   0a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  xv shareware 00 is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats  it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu 0000000 file contribxv000tarz  version 000 is a major upgrade with support for 00bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking  if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 000 also available from export  note that version 000 is not a good choice if you have a 00bit display youll get only 0bit color nor for converting 00bit images to jpeg  but 000 works fine for converting gif and other 0bit images to jpeg  caution there is a glitch in version 000 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 00bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 000  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage000tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v0 decoder while xloadimage 000 is using a hackedover v0  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli000tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 00bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os0 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 00 is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 000000000 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg00zip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 000 or 000000 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 00 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv00zip  hiview requires a 000 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm000 and 000max work windows and os0 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 00  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview00zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv0zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel00 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 000a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 00  available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw000azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic00 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg0zip or jpeg0000zip if you have a 000 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 0b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif0jpgjpg0gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 00bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 00 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif0jpg0zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy  this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats  it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 000 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsalch000zip  note about simtel00 the internets key archive site for pcrelated programs is simtel00 full name wsmrsimtel00armymil 0000000000  simtel00 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel00 that really means pd0msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel00  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel00 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 00000000000 which keeps simtel00 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel00 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel00 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 00 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 00 and 000ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version 00 is available from ftpcicaindianaedu 000000000 file pubpcwin0desktopjview000zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchivewustledu  winjpeg shareware 00 displays jpeggiftargatiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and slideshow  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows0winjp000zip  this is a slow 000compatible version if you register youll get the 000only version which is roughly 00 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 00  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 000 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin0desktopcview000zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos  dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in fullscreen mode not in a window  os0  the following files are available from hobbesnmsuedu 00000000000 note check pubuploads for more recent versions  the hobbes moderator is not

most mac jpeg programs rely on apples jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a 00000 or better cpu and you need to be running system 000 or later  if youre running system 0 you must also install the 00bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 0  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 0000 this file contains quicktime 00 which is better than qt 00 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 00  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 00 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 00 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 000000 file infomacappjpegview00hqx  requires system 0 and quicktime  on 0bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 000x000 pixels on a typical 0mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 00 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 000  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter000hqx  requires system 000 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert00hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v00 a jpeggif converter based on an old version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt00stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 00bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 0 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 00bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress000hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 00bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 000 or later can read and write jfifformat jpeg files use the jpeg plugin from the acquire menu  you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it  amiga  most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at

if youd like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join   0  whats all this hoopla about color quantization  most people dont have fullcolor 00 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 0 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 000 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 0bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 000orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 000 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 000color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 000 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 000 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 000color gif on a 00color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan0bit display hardware already 00bit hicolor pc displays true 00bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   0  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart00  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   0  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 000 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v0 free jpeg code you can also say sample 0x0 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 00bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 0 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 0 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   00  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 00 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 00 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 0a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 00 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif0jpgjpg0gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   00  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  0  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d0 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 00 followed by jfif  0  if you see ff d0 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  0  hsi files start with hsi0  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  0  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d0 and you should be able to read it  0  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d0     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  begin line mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  begin line mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   00  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 0 or 00 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   00  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 00 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    00  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 0 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 000 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 00 or 00rd the size of the gif file not 00th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 00 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 00 to 00 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 000 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v0 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 00 or so when converting gifs values of 00 to 00 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 00 smooth 00 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg group at jpeginfouunetuunet    tom lane organizer independent

  im having a slight problem with the pov raytracer  im not sure if this is the correct group to post to or not  i create tga files on a unix machine using pov  then when i download them to display on my pc theyre listed as bad files  but when i create the file on my pc it displays fine  are unix tgas incompatible with the pc  an easy solution to this problem would be a unix targagif converter  anyone know where i could find one  any help on this subject is appreciated     kevin

     can someone who knows what theyre talking about add a faq entry  on gamma correction  thanks  i get regular questions about gamma correction since i go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli the image loader program i maintain  here is an explanation i often use to answer these questions  this might be suitable for inclusion in the faq  graeme gill   a note on gamma correction and images  author graeme w gill         graemelabtamozau  date 00000   what is all this gamma stuff anyway    although it would be nice to think that an image is an image there are a lot of complications not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats gif jpeg tiff etc etc there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated gamma is one of those things if youve ever downloaded images from bbs or the net youve probably noticed with most image viewing programs that some images look ok some look too dark and some look too light why is this  you may ask this is gamma correction or the lack of it  why do we need gamma correction at all    gamma correction is needed because of the nature of crts cathode ray tubes  the monitors usually used for viewing images if you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene then you have created a linear or ungammacorrected image this is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light ie adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a crt you find that the crt doesnt give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage the amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this  lightout  voltage  crtgamma  so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a crt the image will look much too dark to fix this up you have to gamma correct the image first you need to do the opposite of what the crt will do to the image so that things cancel out and you get what you want so you have to do this to your image  gammacorrectedimage  image  0crtgamma  for most crts the crtgamma is somewhere between 00 and 00  if that is all it is why does it seem so complicated    the problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction also not all sources of images give you linear images video cameras or video signals in general because of this a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them and you are  rarely sure how much if you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light if you display one of those images with a program that doesnt do gamma correction then it will look vaguely right but not perfect because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular crt  whose fault is all this    it is really three things one is all those display programs out there that dont do gamma correction properly another is that most image formats dont specify a standard gamma or dont have some way or recording what their gamma correction is the third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about and create a lot of images with varying gammas  at least two file formats do the right thing the utah graphics toolkit rle format has a semistandard way of recording the gamma of an image the jfif file standard that uses jpeg compression specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 00 ie a linear image  but not everyone obeys the rules  some image loaders for instance xli  an x00 image utility allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view other image viewers eg xv another x00 image program and utilities eg the pbm toolkit provide ways of changing the gamma of an image but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has and then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt monitor   note that xv 000 doesnt provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image you need to adjust the r g and b curves to the appropriate gamma in the coledit controls altering the intensity in the hsv controls doesnt do the right thing as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on h and s this tends to give a tint to the image   how can i figure out what my viewer does or what gamma my screen has    the simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgammajpg provided with xli distribution which is a jfif jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps the ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye one using continuous tones and the other using dithering  if your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images then the two ramps should look symmetrical and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom to find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen and defocus your eyes a bit  if your viewer doesnt do gamma correction then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part and the point of equal brightness will be above the center  if your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma and decrease it if it is below the center the value will usually be around 00   with xli for instance you can adjust the display gamma with the dispgamma flag and once youve got it right you can set the displaygamma environment variable in your profile  how do i figure out what the gamma of an image is    this is the most tricky bit as a general rule it seems that a lot of true color ie 00 bit ppm jpg images have a gamma of 00 linear although there are many about that have some gamma correction it seems that the majority of pseudo color images ie 0 bit images with color maps  gif etc are gamma corrected to some degree or other  if your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good and gamma corrected images will look too light  if your viewer doesnt do gamma correction then linear images will look too dark and gamma corrected images will ok  why linear images are sometimes not such a good thing   one of the reason that many high quality formats such as video use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium this is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic this means images  could make better use of 0 bits per color for instance if they used gamma correction the implication though is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 0 bit image to 00 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy since little popular software does this and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level  if some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing  i am told that the kodak photocd format for instance has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image

photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard  jpeg is designed for compressing either fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes it does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line drawings  jpeg does not handle blackandwhite 0bitperpixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression  standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively  jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in  the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of lightanddark  thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans  if you plan to machineanalyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye  a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters  this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality  you can make extremely small files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  conversely if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression   0  why use jpeg  there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 00bitperpixel color data instead of 0bitperpixel data  making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images  being able to compress a 0 mbyte fullcolor file down to 000 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time  if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one  more details below  if your viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  even with a jpegcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance  thus using jpeg is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply  its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file  ill let you do the arithmetic yourself  the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 00 bitspixel 00 million colors instead of 0 or less 000 or fewer colors  if you have only 0bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you  within a couple of years though 0bit gif will look as obsolete as blackandwhite macpaint format does today  furthermore for reasons detailed in section 0 jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware  hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard   0  when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif  jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both  one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to  as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing fullcolor or grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material  jpeg is superior even if you dont have 00bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do  see section 0 for details  gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings  in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif  jpeg cant squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects  this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files  jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc  the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont jpeg it  computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such  plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about 00 gray levels before jpeg is useful for grayscale images  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for grayscale images of up to 000 levels while jpeg is not  if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg  you will lose a little image quality if you do section 0 which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  if you start from a gif youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse  however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway  this is a decision youll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 00 for hints  be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well   0  how well does jpeg compress images  pretty darn well  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 000x000 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 0b  file   size in bytescomments  shipppm0000000  original file in ppm format no compression 00 bits  or 0 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead shipppmz 000000  ppm file passed through unix compress  compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note  other textoriented compressors give similar results shipgif 000000  converted to gif with ppmquant fs 000  ppmtogif  most of the savings is the result of losing color  info gif saves 0 bitspixel not 00  see sec 0  shipjpg00 000000  cjpeg q 00    highest useful quality setting  this is indistinguishable from the 00bit original  at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00    default setting  you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this  from the original even with both onscreen at once shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  this has slight defects if you know what to look  for you could tell its been jpeged without seeing  the original  still as good image quality as many  recent postings in usenet pictures groups shipjpg00  00000  cjpeg q 00  jpegs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent  at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some  still ive seen plenty of usenet postings that were  of poorer image quality than this shipjpg0o   0000  cjpeg q 0 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead  blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or  indexing purposes  note that this file is tiny  the compression ratio from the original is 0000   in this case jpeg can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 00 file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a fullcolor display  this seems to be a typical ratio for realworld scenes   0  what are good quality settings for jpeg  most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting  there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings  quality 00 does not mean keep 00 of the information as some have claimed  the quality scale is purely arbitrary its not a percentage of anything  the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb  the default quality setting q 00 is very often the best choice  this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image  try q 00 first if you see defects then go up  except for experimental purposes never go above q 00 saying q 000 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 00 but of hardly any better quality  if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q 00 without objectionable degradation  on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q 00 is about right for compressing 00bit images but q 00 to 00 is usually better for converting gifs see section 00 for more info  if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of 0 to 00 is about right  q 0 or so may be amusing as op art  note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 0b and to many programs based on it  other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale  some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just highmediumlowstyle choices   0  where can i get jpeg software  most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you dont know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you dont have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article  that article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in the newsanswers archive  note this list changes constantly  if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the newsanswers archive   0a  if you are looking for canned software viewers etc  the first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one kind of system  if you dont see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list  note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too  x windows  xv shareware 00 is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats  it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations  its available for ftp from exportlcsmitedu 0000000 file contribxv000tarz  version 000 is a major upgrade with support for 00bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking  if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 000 also available from export  note that version 000 is not a good choice if you have a 00bit display youll get only 0bit color nor for converting 00bit images to jpeg  but 000 works fine for converting gif and other 0bit images to jpeg  caution there is a glitch in version 000 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry  another good choice for x windows is john cristys free imagemagick package also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribimagemagicktarz this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  the imagemagick viewer handles 00bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software  both of the above are large complex packages  if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 000  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxloadimage000tarz  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v0 decoder while xloadimage 000 is using a hackedover v0  the next xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from exportlcsmitedu file contribxli000tarz  both programs are said to do the right thing with 00bit displays   msdos  this covers plain dos for windows or os0 programs see the next headings  one good choice is eric praetzels free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 00 is available by ftp from suneeuwaterlooca 000000000 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg00zip  this is a good basic viewer that works on either 000 or 000000 machines  the user interface is not flashy but its functional  another freeware jpeggiftga viewer is mohammad rezaeis hiview  the current version 00 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicshv00zip  hiview requires a 000 or better cpu and a vcpicompatible memory manager qemm000 and 000max work windows and os0 do not  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen  for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably  note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully  a shareware alternative is colorview for dos 00  this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives  its user interface is also much spiffierlooking although personally i find it harder to use  more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware  for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsdcview00zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv0zip or vesatsrzip from the same directory  many recent pcs have a builtin vesa driver so dont try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing  a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i dont know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel00 archives at that time  the wellknown gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 000a  however cshows jpeg implementation isnt very good its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hicolor displays  too bad  itd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow  shareware 00  available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgifcshw000azip  due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine  if you cant get any of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer  if you have hicolor hardware dont use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targacapable viewer instead  vpic00 is reputed to do the right thing with hicolor displays  the independent jpeg groups free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsjpeg0zip or jpeg0000zip if you have a 000 and extended memory  these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 0b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats  handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gif0jpgjpg0gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you cant get 00bit color output from a jpeg  the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsis proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenetstandard jfif format  since hsiformat files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability  version 00 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  get it from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsgif0jpg0zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on nonpc platforms  handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy  this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats  it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 000 is available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note below file msdosgraphicsalch000zip  note about simtel00 the internets key archive site for pcrelated programs is simtel00 full name wsmrsimtel00armymil 0000000000  simtel00 runs a nonunix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at simtel00 that really means pd0msdosgraphics  if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel00  there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel00 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  a popular usa mirror site is oakoaklandedu 00000000000 which keeps simtel00 files in eg pubmsdosgraphics  if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel00 by email see informational postings in comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel00 mirror is  microsoft windows  there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead  note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window  the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast  version 00 is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip requires windows 00 and 000ormorecolors mode  this is a nofrills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing  jview is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it cant create new jpeg files and it doesnt view gifs  jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its an excellent basic viewer  the current version 00 is available from ftpcicaindianaedu 000000000 file pubpcwin0desktopjview000zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchivewustledu  winjpeg shareware 00 displays jpeggiftargatiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and slideshow  the current version is 00 available from simtel00 and mirror sites see note above file msdoswindows0winjp000zip  this is a slow 000compatible version if you register youll get the 000only version which is roughly 00 faster  colorview is another shareware entry 00  this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg  if you want to try it anyway the current version is 000 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file pubpcwin0desktopcview000zip  i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos  dvpeg see dos heading also works under

jpeg programs rely on apples jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a 00000 or better cpu and you need to be running system 000 or later  if youre running system 0 you must also install the 00bit quickdraw extension this is builtin on system 0  you can get quicktime by ftp from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx as of 0000 this file contains quicktime 00 which is better than qt 00 in several ways  with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file  however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 00  mac users should keep in mind that quicktimes jpeg format pictjpeg is not the same as the usenetstandard jfif jpeg format  see section 00 for details  if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format  the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pictjpeg format or gif format  it also can convert between the two jpeg formats  the current version 00 is a big improvement over prior versions  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu 000000 file infomacappjpegview00hqx  requires system 0 and quicktime  on 0bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers  jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact its the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 000x000 pixels on a typical 0mb mac  given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers  you can zoom in on any desired portion though  some people like this behavior some dont  overall jpegviews user interface is very well thought out  gifconverter a shareware 00 image viewerconverter supports jfif and pictjpeg as well as gif and several other image formats  the latest version is 000  get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacartgifgifconverter000hqx  requires system 000 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeggif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images  also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime  but its faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version  jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert00hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer  previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v00 a jpeggif converter based on an old version of the ijg code  if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert  apples free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats  you can get pictpixie from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt00stuffpictpixiehqx requires quicktime  pictpixie was intended as a developers tool and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 00bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix  there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net  if you have this you should trash it as its even buggier  also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleanedup descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor  note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net  storm technologys picture decompress is a free jpeg viewerconverter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system 0 or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems  it does need 00bit quickdraw so really old machines cant use it  you can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacapppicturedecompress000hqx  you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it  if your machine is too old to run 00bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for singleprogram jpeg viewing  if you dont want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer  more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenetstandard jfif format  adobe photoshop version 000 or later can read and write jfifformat jpeg files use the jpeg plugin from the acquire menu  you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it  amiga  most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at

not support jpeg   portable software for almost any system  if none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in 0b  youll also need a viewer program if your display is 0 bits or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm 00bit image files  there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings with more popping up every day  i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow  in that case purchase a hardwareassisted product  ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the

group is a volunteer organization if youd like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join   0  whats all this hoopla about color quantization  most people dont have fullcolor 00 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores 0 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 000 or fewer distinct colors at a time  to display a fullcolor image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors  this process is called color quantization  this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  were stuck with the standard usage though  clearly color quantization is a lossy process  it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings  since jpeg is a fullcolor format converting a color jpeg image for display on 0bitorless hardware requires color quantization  this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 000orlesscolor gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not 000 colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpegs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors  each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors  therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output  incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image  even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences  i occasionally see posted images described as 000color jpeg  this tells me that the poster a hasnt read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for jpeg  on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 000 or fewer colors  a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesnt allow more than 000 palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to this is also the disadvantage of gif youre stuck with the senders quantization  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization algorithm youre out of luck  for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware jpegs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware  furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have  with a gif youre stuck forevermore with what was sent  its also worth mentioning that many gifviewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines  if you view a 000color gif on a 00color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often its also due to sloppiness  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed  thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones  finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan0bit display hardware already 00bit hicolor pc displays true 00bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc  for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an allaround better choice than gif for representing images in a machineindependent fashion   0  how does jpeg work  the buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding  this articles long enough already so im not going to say more than that here  for technical information see the compcompression faq this is available from the newsanswers archive at rtfmmitedu in files pubusenetnewsanswerscompressionfaqpart00  if you need help in using the newsanswers archive see the top of this article   0  what about lossless jpeg  theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression  at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial  saying q 000 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step  there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step  with the v0 free jpeg code you can also say sample 0x0 to turn off subsampling  keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file  even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image  at this minimumloss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 00bitperpixel image  true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bitforbit accuracy  if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 0 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard  this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 0 or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents   00  why all the argument about file formats  strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format  the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations  since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem  in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses  the closest thing we have to a defacto standard jpeg format is some work thats been coordinated by people at ccube microsystems  they have defined two jpegbased file formats    jfif jpeg file interchange format a lowend format that transports     pixels and not much else    tiffjpeg aka tiff 00 an extension of the aldus tiff format  tiff is     a highend format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff  its not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpegrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards  i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 00 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details  even when tiffjpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiffjpeg files may never be as transportable  a particular case that people may be interested in is apples quicktime software for the macintosh  quicktime uses a jfifcompatible format wrapped inside the macspecific pict structure  conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 0a  if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 00 for details  another particular case is handmade softwares programs gif0jpgjpg0gif and image alchemy  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format  by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi  this format is not readable by any nonhsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings  use the j switch to get jfif output  this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default  you still should be careful not to post hsiformat files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonpc platforms   00  how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it  if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wont read its likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpegbased format  you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file  0  a jfifstandard file will start with the characters hex ff d0 ff e0     followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 00 followed by jfif  0  if you see ff d0 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw jpeg file  this is probably decodable asis by jfif software      its worth a try anyway  0  hsi files start with hsi0  youre out of luck unless you have hsi     software  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they     wont decompress properly with nonhsi programs  0  a macintosh pict file if jpegcompressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif  strip off     everything before the ff d0 and you should be able to read it  0  anything else its a proprietary format or not jpeg at all  if you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream     if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d0     try stripping off everything before that  in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is  begin line mcx   whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with  begin line mi   if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading nonjfif files   00  what about arithmetic coding  the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file  on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 0 or 00 percent smaller than huffman coding  all the filesize numbers previously cited are for huffman coding  unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm att and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies  the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best  at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles  in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet  there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future  stay tuned for further details   00  does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression  it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case  in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around  the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an identical jpeg file  even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software  its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error  if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration output  it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it  in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss  even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation if youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of 00 pixels you might be safe but thats a mighty limited capability  the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps  use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away  aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compressiondecompression time this way    00  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg  as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg  if you can obtain the original fullcolor data the gif was made from its far better to make a jpeg from that  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality  the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary  some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section 0 in particular cartoontype gifs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif  so check the sizes too  experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg  they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation dont waste your time converting any gif much under 000 kbytes  also dont expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from fullcolor originals  to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough jpeg files would be ie shoot for 00 or 00rd the size of the gif file not 00th as suggested in earlier comparisons  many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor border around a gif image  while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files  it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging  if you are on an x windows system xvs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this  cjpegs default q setting of 00 is appropriate for fullcolor input but for gif inputs q settings of 00 to 00 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation  if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary  color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 000 colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like highspatialfrequency color noise and jpeg cant compress noise very well  the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble  appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image than youd get without smoothing  with the v0 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in  try smooth 00 or so when converting gifs values of 00 to 00 seem to work well for highquality gifs  heavyhanded dithering may require larger smoothing factors  if you can see regular finescale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for  too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you dont want  if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package  however cjpegs builtin smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol  the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 00 smooth 00 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs  but if you really care about the image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings     for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg group at jpeginfouunetuunet    tom lane organizer independent

  my threed library does a lot of projections  duh  but currently it is projecting an objects vertices on a per triangle basis  this is grossly inefficient for 00 of the objects displayed  which can be optimized by doing projections one time once for each vertex  but objects whose zextents intersect the hither plane cant benefit from this because new vertices must be created during zclipping  anyone have any better ideas  yes  heres what you should do  keep the vertices in an array and have the polygons triangles are okay but nsided polygons are slightly more efficient store the indices into the array of the vertices that comprise them  you set a flag for each vertex when you transform it so you dont have to transform any vertex more than once you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys dont have to be transformed at all  whenever you transform a vertex check if its on the far side of the hither plane if it is you can project it right away and store the result  then do your z clip any vertices that get produced will have to have their projection done at that stage    bernie roehl         university of waterloo dept of electrical and computer engineering mail broehlsuneeuwaterlooca voice  000 0000000 x 0000 work

   in 0d studio is there any way to create refraction diffraction etc   i want to simulate such things as glass lenses bottles etc  there might be an ipas routine that does thatbut i canr be sure  another way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the image  then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection  it will take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection but thats the only thing i can think of  
  greetings all    does anyone use some form of 0d input device  i would like to hear any information on any systems that people are currently using  please email responses i will summarise if i get some feedback   brendan langoulant brendanguuwaeduau

  hi im new to imaging and my advisor and i would like to  do some 0d reconstructions  we take slides biological and image them on a 000  then the software allows us to trace the outline of the objects  we want to save  the outlines are stored as a tiff file  we would like to convert a group of these outlines into a  0d image  we are unsure as to where to begin  someone mentioned that if we could convert the tiff into a vector format then  we could view them in autocad  any help would be greatly appreciated  pankaj oberoi spedheadathenamitedu   
  i recently read in a book that the tiff version 00 specification was due to be released in the spring of 0000  i am interested in finding out about the new features of the tiff spec and if it is out  specifically i need to know if tiff 00 supports vq decompression andor image tiling

  many highend graphics cards come with c source code for doing basic graphics sorts of things change colors draw pointslinespolygonsfills etc  does such a library exist for generic vga graphics cardschips hopefully in the public domain  this would be for the purpose of compiling under a nondos operating system running on a standard pc   im also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library  package to do pc vga graphics    im currently working on a realtime application running on a pcc with a  nondos kernel that needs to do some simple graphics  im not sure if  reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not   i suspect ill implement the display controller as a server process that  handles graphics requests queued on a mailbox one at a time  if this  provides sufficiently frequent display updates then i believe that i can  restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus  constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need for a reentrant graphics library    being fairly new to the realtime systems world i may be overlooking something what do you think  cheers bob fitzsimmonsfitzcseogiedu0000000000

  i currently have some grayscale image files that are not in any standard format  they simply contain the 0bit pixel values  i would like to display these images on a pc  the conversion to a gif format would be helpful  this conversion can take place either on a pc or on a unix system and i could then download it to the pc can anyone suggest where i can find software to do this  alternatively i may have to write my own conversion program  in this case could someone tell me where i can find the gif format specification  please email me directly at shaylashannonjplnasagov  thanks

   hello i have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a moderately helpful response on a couple of issues this i appreciated very much  i would however like to know why it is that ther is simply no  information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics programmer the subjects are  0 how do you access the extra video memory on a video board i know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to dothis i have 0meg of memory on my board and according to all the books and info i have read i am only at maximum using 000k of it there is a way to do this in standard vga cause i have seen vidoe paging written in assembly which i dont know written into apps hat use mode 00h to get any speed at all you have to do this how do i do it  0 the vesa standard what gives here i have read most of what the net has to offer on vesa and as far as coding for vesa goes most of the advice is cryptic at best where do i get public domain info that will tell me in mostly plain english how the vesa calls work  my biggest gripe is about number 0 i have bought graphics books i have asked graphics professors i have hunted the net through both gopher and archie i ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is some lock on this information graphics programming books tell alot of programmiing algorithm information but they always fall short of telling you how to really control the video bios what are all the calls folks i know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff where are you and why havent you written a book yet   please help  thanks in advance  stephen palm palmsnycanvabitnet please send all personal replies to the above address thanks

and meyer   in article 0000may000000000000halcom bobphalcom bob pendleton writes      this is getting pretty silly first off hacker is an obsolete term      doesnt matter what it used to mean today it means thief      it only means thief if you want it to mean that  to me it means     lots of context wickedly omitted by myself       anyway if i say joe is a hacker to most english speaking people who  know the word theyll probably think he is either a poor golfer or a  bad carpenter but there are very very few people who will think he is  a good and clever programmer      if you chose to call yourself by a term that means thief dont be  surprised when people think you are a thief even if you dont agree  with that definition of the word               the narrower view that a hacker when   associated with the computing environment is a dishonest   expert is not so widespread im my opinion at least with the   people involved with the field imho the wider meaning is not   obsolete at all no matter how much the lay press would like it to   be      therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker and somebody   perceives you as a thief then this person belongs to a very very   small group that has some computer knowledge but not enough to know   the wider and original meaning of the word    unfortunately the general public has a very narrow view of the deep dark recesses of the art of computing  what little they do see is from the view given to them by the media  from what i have seen from the media hacker is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person  i on the other hand know what hacker means from those who consider themselves such  following is the definition from jargon file 0000 this is also known as the hackers dictionary  the definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage     hacker originally someone who makes furniture with an axe n      0 a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable      systems and how to stretch their capabilities as opposed to most      users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary  0 one who      programs enthusiastically even obsessively or who enjoys      programming rather than just theorizing about programming  0 a      person capable of appreciating hack value  0 a person who is      good at programming quickly  0 an expert at a particular program      or one who frequently does work using it or on it as in a unix      hacker  definitions 0 through 0 are correlated and people who      fit them congregate  0 an expert or enthusiast of any kind  one      might be an astronomy hacker for example  0 one who enjoys the      intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing      limitations  0 deprecated a malicious meddler who tries to      discover sensitive information by poking around  hence password      hacker network hacker  see cracker       the term hacker also tends to connote membership in the global      community defined by the net see network the and      internet address  it also implies that the person described      is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic see      hacker ethic the       it is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe      oneself that way  hackers consider themselves something of an      elite a meritocracy based on ability though one to which new      members are gladly welcome  there is thus a certain ego      satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker but if      you claim to be one and are not youll quickly be labeled      bogus  see also wannabee     hacker ethic the n  0 the belief that informationsharing      is a powerful positive good and that it is an ethical duty of      hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and      facilitating access to information and to computing resources      wherever possible  0 the belief that systemcracking for fun      and exploration is ethically ok as long as the cracker commits      no theft vandalism or breach of confidentiality       both of these normative ethical principles are widely but by no      means universally accepted among hackers most hackers subscribe      to the hacker ethic in sense 0 and many act on it by writing and      giving away free software  a few go further and assert that      all information should be free and any proprietary      control of it is bad this is the philosophy behind the gnu      project       sense 0 is more controversial some people consider the act of      cracking itself to be unethical like breaking and entering      but this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who      see themselves as benign crackers see also samurai  on      this view it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy      to a break into a system and then b explain to the sysop      preferably by email from a superuser account exactly how it      was done and how the hole can be plugged  acting as an      unpaid an unsolicited tiger team       the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker      ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share      technical tricks software and where possible computing      resources with other hackers  huge cooperative networks such as      usenet fidonet and internet see internet address      can function without central control because of this trait they      both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be      hackerdoms most valuable intangible asset    finally a true hacker does not name himselfherself one for this is   a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large  to me a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who  says nahh i just know a thing or two people always exagerate   note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself meaning himselfherself one but simply says that it is better not to do so  there are many who do not know the meaning of hacker  so in order to defend the true meaning of the word it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known respected hacker around the workplace  this means that hacker is defined in terms of some wellknown and respected person  sometimes there may only be one such person   no matter what mr dumpty says language doesnt work that way   actually it does you just have to get adequate press coverage   language works anyway that we want it to work  the purpose of language is to communicate  to oversimplify as long as communication is taking place
