  this is a periodic posting intended to answer the frequently asked question what is the dod it is posted the first of each month with an expiration time of over a month thus unless your sites news software is illmannered this posting should always be available this witdodfaq is crossposted to all four recmotorcycles groups in an attempt to catch most new users and followups are directed to recmotorcycles  last changed 0feb00 to add a message from the kotl and a bit of halon  version 00  this collection was originally assembled by lissa shoun from the original postings with lissas

and others   how do i get a dod number  if the most frequently asked question in recmotorcycles is what is the dod then the second most frequently asked question must be how do i get a dod number that is as simple as asking the keeper of the list kotl accept no substitue keepers for a number if youre feeling creative and your favorite number hasnt been taken already you can make a request subject to kotl approval warning nonnumeric non base00 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the kotl not that you wont get it but you will pay for it  oh and just one little tiny suggestion ask the kotl in email youll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net and youll look like a clueless newbie too  by now youre probably asking so whos the kotl already well as john sloan notes below thats about the only real secret left around here but a few unsubtle hints can be divulged first it is not myself nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting maybe  though john was the original kotl second in keeping with the true spirit of unix the kotls first name is only two letters long and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters 00 the kotl shares his name with a line oriented text utility third he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new dod numbers mostly to boneheads with weenie mailers fourth there is reason to suspect the kotl of being a deadhead   newsflash a message from the kotl   once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the kotl please keep in mind that the kotl does indeed work for a living and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done  your request may languish in mailer queue for gasp days perhaps even horrors a week or two  during such times of economic activity on the part of the kotls employers sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue it just makes it longer verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader  if you suspect mailer problems at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted lest you be assigned multiple numbers what you think the kotl memorizes the list    one more thing the kotl says that its telepathic powers arent what they used to be so provide some information for the list will ya the typical dod list entry contains number name statecountry  email address for example  0000ed greencaedgreeneastsuncom  ps while john mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for dod membership thats not strictly true these days as there are a number of denizens who lack one or both  blaine dances with bikers gardner   blgardnejavelinsimescom                denizens of doom by bruce tanner dod 0000        road rider august 0000 reprinted with bruces permission  there is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal  things that a bunch of bikers do  they discuss motorcycles and   motorcycling beverages cleaning fluids baklavah balaclava caltrops   helmets antifog shields spine protectors aerodynamics threeangle valve seats bird hits deer whistles good restaurants racing philosophy  traffic laws tickets corrosion control personalities puns double  entendres culture absence of culture first rides and friendship  they  argue with each other and plan rides together  the difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that  although they get together just about everyday most have never seen each  other face to face  the members of this group live all over the known world  and communicate with each other electronically via computer  the computers range from laptops to multimillion dollar computer centers   the people range from college and university students to hightech industry  professionals to publicaccess electronic bulletinboard users  currently  recmotorcycles pronounced wreckdotmotorcycles its the file name for  the groups primary online meeting place carries about 0000 articles per  month  it is read by an estimated 00000 people  most of the frequent  posters belong to a motorcycle club the denizens of doom usually referred  to as the dod  the dod started when motorcyclist john r nickerson wrote a couple of  parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes  fellow computer  enthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name denizen  of doom  a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr 0000 keeper of  the flame  bruce was then designated dod nr 0000 retroactively and of  course nickerson the originator of the parodies was given dod nr 0000  the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules  appealed to many so john sloan  dod nr 0000  became keeper of the  list issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one  to date there have been  almost 000 memberships issued to people all over the united states and  canada as well as australia new zealand the united kingdom france  germany norway and finland  keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch  the initial run  of 000 patches sold out immediately  the profits from this went to the  american motorcycle heritage foundation  another amhf fund raiser   selling denizens of doom pins to members  was started by arnie skurow a  few months later  again the project was successful and the profits were  donated to the foundation  so far the denizens have contributed over 0000  to the ama museum  a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs  in the motorcycle heritage museum  as often as possible the doders crawl out from behind their crts and go  riding together  it turns out that the two largest concentrations of  doders are centered near denverboulder colorado and in californias  silicon valley  consequently two major events are the annual assault on  rollins pass in colorado and the northern versus southern california  joust  the rideandfeed is a bike trip over rollins pass followed by a big  barbecue dinner  the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern  california ride south riders from southern california to ride north  meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle  an additional plan  for 0000 is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction  with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus ohio in july  though its a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective  communications hub recmotorcycles will not replace the more traditional  motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in  search of twowheeled camaraderie its a great way for kindred spirits to  get together  long may they flame   live to flame  flame to livecenterbar  this official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which  you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do  anything like that face to face  these insults are known as flames   issuing them is called flaming  flames often start when a member  disagrees with something another member has posted over the network  a  typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reasoned rebuttal would be  something like  what an incredibly stupid statement you spandexclad  poseur  this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense  of the original poster describing just what they think of you your riding  ability and your cat              the denizens of doom the saga unfolds                    by john sloan  dod 0000  periodically the question what is dod is raised this is one of those questions in the same class as why is the sky blue if there is a god why is there so much suffering in the world and why do women inevitably tell you that youre such a nice guy just before they dump you the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism tradition and philosophy questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms motorcycle service bays and in the halls of academe for generations   a long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem on a computer far far away on the net topologically speaking two machines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in chicago a chap who wished to remain anonymous but who was eventually assigned the dod membership 0 wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of recmotorcycles and signed it the denizen of doom not wishing to identify himself he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become dod 0 to post it for him dod 0 not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual did so  flaming and other amusements followed   he who would become the holder of dod membership 0 thought this was the funniest thing hed seen in a while being the sort that is pretty easily amused so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom motorcycle club and started signing his postings with his membership number   perhaps readers of recmotorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues no rules no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organized electronically  it may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a gestalt personality something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts  it could also be that were all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members   in a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy the denizens of doom motorcycle club was born a club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face and perhaps like it that way yet feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup a club organized and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail with a membershipmailing list often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating around the country organized by dod 0 club patches organized by 00 and even an mtvstyle music video produced by 00 and distributed on vhs by 00   where will it end who knows will the dod start sanctioning races placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the onboard engine management computers will the dod organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 000sized unix system only time will tell   the dod has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles to become a member one need only ask although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets new members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list which includes name state and email address   the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live forever or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name                     live to flame  flame to live         the dod daemon as seen on the patches pins etc by

amusement was had at the first annual dod unicoastal ironhorse ride  joust by denizens referring to each other as chuck i guess you had to be there i wasnt   chuck  i didnt want to be a software systems analyst  cowtowing to the whims of a machine and saying yessir nosir  mayihaveanothersir  my mother made me do it  i wanted  to live a mans life music slowly builds in background  riding nortons and triumphs through the highest mountain passes  and the deepest valleys  living the life of a motorcyclist  doing donuts and evading the police  terrorizing old ladies and raping small children  eating small dogs for tea and large dogs for dinner  in short  i want to be      a denizen  chuck rips off his lab coat revealing black leather jacket with fringe boots and cap  scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted rollins pass  a small throng of hells angels sit on their harleys in the near background gunning their engines showering lookerson with nails as they turn donuts and leaking oil on the tarmac  chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed fat boy   chuck sings to the tune of the lumberjack song  im a denizen and im okay i flame all night and i ride all day  hells angels echo chorus surprisingly heavy on tenors hes a denizen and hes okay he flames all night and he rides all day  i ride my bike i eat my lunch i go to the lavatry

you have to be killed  well the first thing you have to understand just in case you managed to read this far and still not figure it out is that the dod started as a joke and in the words of one denizen it intends to remain one  sometime in the far distant past a hapless newbie asked what does dod stand for its not the department of defense is it naturally a denizen who had watched the movie top gun a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied  thats classified we could tell you but then wed have to kill you  and the rest is history  a variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about what dod stands for notable contributions and contributers where known include  daughters of democracy dod 00doers of donuts dancers of despair dod 0debasers of daughters dickweeds of denverdriveway of death debauchers of donutsdumpers of dirtbikes  note that this is not a comprehensive list as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of ones imagination or dictionary file                         the recmotophoto archive  first a bit of history this all started with ilana stern and chuck rogers organizing a recmotorcycles photo album many copies were made and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in unknown locations then bruce tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp  email access but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive  not only can you see what all these folks look like you can also gawk at their motorcycles a few nonphoto files are available from the server too they include the dod membership list the dod yellow pages the general recmotorcycles faq and this faq posting  here are a couple of excerpts from from messages bruce posted about how to use the archive    via ftp  cerritosedu 00000000000  via email  the address is servercerritosedu  the commands are given in the body of the message  the current commands are dir and send given one per line  the arguments to the commands are vms style file specifications  for recmotophoto the file spec is dodfile  for example you can send  dir dod send dodbrucetannergif send doddodframeps  and youll get back 0 mail messages a directory listing 0 uuencoded parts of brucetannergif and the dodframeps file in ascii  oh wildcards  are allowed but a maximum of 00 mail messages rounded up to the next whole file are send  a send dodgif would send 000 files of 00k each not a good idea   bruce tanner        000 0000000 x 000    tannercerritosedu cerritos college    norwalk ca             cerritostanner    a couple of comments bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this so why not drop him a note if you find the recmotophoto archive useful second since bruce has provided the server as a favor it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours california time                           patches what patches  you may have heard mention of various dod trinkets such as patches  pins and your reaction was probably i want or thats sick or perhaps thats sick i want  well theres some good news and some bad news the good news is that theres been an amazing variety of dodlabeled widgets created the bad news is that there isnt anywhere you can buy any of them this isnt because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no dod store that keeps a stock all of the creations have been done by individual denizens out of their own pockets the typical procedure is someone says im thinking of having a dod frammitz made theyll cost xxxx with xxxx going to the ama museum anyone want one then orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the prepaid orders is produced and quickly consumed so if you want a dod doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all this is anarchy in action  heres a possibly incomplete list of known dod merchandise and perpetrators patches dod00 pins dod00 stickers dod00 motorcycle license plate frames dod000 tshirts dod00 polo

motorcyclist association motorcycle heritage museum as of june 0000 over 0000 dollars has been contributed to the museum fund by the dod if you visit the museum youll see a large plaque on the

      one thing is certain though its still too cold  after about 00  minutes i had to stop and hold my muffler for a while    be very careful about this if youre really cold the muffler will feel fine till you leave all the charred skin on it when you peel your hands off  i speak from experience you can also do all  kindsa americanism of the day damage to your circulation warming  hands up on something too hot by far the best fastest and safest way to do it is to shove the hands up the opposit sleeves and stand there like a ming emporer for a while five minutes should  do it  
  first ride of the season  one thing is certain though its still too cold  after about 00 minutes i had to stop and hold my muffler for a while  when i got home after a few hours i kept all my gear on for about a half hour in the house  00f 000 humidity no wind protection and 00mph do not mix well   hell this is warm i retired my fleece from under the aerostich last  month when the temperature got aboce 00 try living a couple of years  on the dole so you cant afford any heating you put the gear on in october abd you take it off again in may getting out on the bike  seems like a luxury in comparison cos oyur usuallu going somewhere  warm   its all relative   happy cold riding   who are you trying to kid  its the pain that makes it all worthwhile  
  every spec of alertness to keep from getting squished otherwise its not only dangerous its unpleasant the same goes for cold and fatigue as i once took a half hour nap at a gas station to insure that i would make it  yeah hypothermia is much more detrimemtal to your judgement and reactions than people realise i wish i had the patience to stop when i should one day ill pay for it  if you  begin to shiver  stop and warm up thoroughly if you leave it till the shivering stops this doesnt mean youre ok again it means  youre a danger to yourself and everyone else on the road  your brain and body are working about as fast as a tree grows you will not realise this yourself till you hit something the next stage is passing out  this usually means falling off  
   so you cant ride the bike but you will drive truck home the judgement and motor skills needed to pilot a moto are not required in a cage this scares the sht out of me    this is a piece of psychology its essential for any long term biker to understand people do not think if i do this will someone else suffer they assess things purely on if i do this will i suffer  this is a vital concept in bikecage interaction

  id like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about  fighting my ticket  many of you wrote to say that you have successfully fought and won your  case in court  others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge  about the circumstances surrounding your ticket while one fellow lost because the judge just didnt appear to be in the mood for such foolishness  several of you suggested that i obtain a book called fight your ticket  the general theme from those who said go for it was to be prepared   i should do as much research as possible go back and review the scene  transcribe what happened to tape or paper use any witnesses that may  have been around have a list of questions to ask the cop andor the judge and to be positive and assertive  i am innocent until proven guilty gulp  a few people suggested trying to get my court date changed as this might  trip up the arresting officer he may not show up if the date is on his day off or if he feelsknows that he doesnt have a chance to win against you  one individual stated that an officer could be an expert witness and if he says i was speeding then by damn i was speeding  another says that i must have been paced or clocked with a radar gun  lots of good suggestions and ideas from you all  ill let you know what happens after the big day     peter d nesbitt      air traffic controller      pnesbittmcimailcom                               oakland bay tracon

     grf dropped my shoei rf000 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock  it onto its centerstand chipped the heck out of the paint on it    so i cheerfully spent 00 on a bottle of testors model paint and  repainted the scratches and chips for 00 minutes    then while it was drying i realized that i was out of smokes and that my  cage is not currently running so i had to take my bike down to the  store not wanting to mess up my paint job i said well heck i can just  use my old helmet this is your standard el cheapie openface      i didnt notice a big difference when i switched to the shoei but  switching back was really bad     0 doesnt fit worth a damn too wide in the sides too short front to  back  0 with a faceplate its still bloody windy with the shoei i normally  ignore the face shield until i get up to about 00ish with this one  taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind          the question for the day is re passenger helmets if you dont know for  certain whos gonna ride with you like say you meet them at a  church  meeting yeah thats the ticket what are some guidelines should i just  pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet xl or should i  maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely  passenger

       watch out  often when some scumbag steals the cover that means    that they were or are looking to steal the bike  in my case i    had a faded cover stolen off a bmw r000rs that was stashed in an    apartment carport and not visible from the street  they evidently    decided the beemer wasnt worth stealing but did try the next night to    steal a honda hurricane 000 parked in the next apartment building    a neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops   i know this is just setting myself up but this is actually one of the things that is really good about bmw bikes  from all accounts ive heard practically no one steals bmws probably it is similar for moto guzzis and other relative exotics since there isnt a large demand for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down it seems that the most stolen bikes are harleys and 000cc jap sport bikes    jonathan e polito     internet jpolitoencorecom encore computer corp 000 kildaire farm rd cary nc  00000  usa 0000000000voice  0000000000fax

  dont you just hate when the speedo and tach on your bike start to cloud over from all that nasty sunshine the detailing tip of the week is to use rubbing compound  moisten a rag apply some rubbing compound and work into the translucent previously transparent material after a few  minutes of working on the plastic face the dial or plastic  face will be clear once more will not work for glass  a couple of other tips  0 make a habit of parking the bike so that instruments are facing away    from the sun  0 meguiars mirror glaze plastic polish  plastic cleaner cue canned    product plug 0000  roisesumaxseattleuedu linda roise writes ok for a novice question is there anything that will clean a faceshield and also remove abrasions so that one can see through it better    what you want are meguiars mirror glaze plastic polish and plastic cleaner they are very mild abrasives meant to remove scratches from plastic for fine scratches just use the polish for bigger ones start with the cleaner and finish with the polish the stuff is 00 bucks per bottle at most auto or motorcycle parts stores dont choke over the price too much since both bottles will probably last you 00 years the stuff works great on plastic watch crystals and compact discs too   blaine gardner  evans  sutherland bgardnerdsdescom

  i cant think of another subject that generates as much contradictory advice as traffic laws and their enforcement  everybodys got an opinion and is dead certain they are right  yet acurate information is extremely difficult to come by  the dmv doesnt know  cops dont know  your traffic school instructor doesnt know  the vehicle code only tells part of the story  judges choose to interpret the laws in a wide variety of ways  and the public at large  i seldom hear any advice that doesnt disagree with something ive experienced  if you dont believe me i suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code study it and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really happens  read fight your ticket too but dont miss the little section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and youre basically screwed  as you may have guessed im pretty down on the system here in california  ive carefully prepared for court bringing witnesses and revealing serious holes in the officers story only to be slapped with the maximum allowable fine plus assessments of over 000  the message clear that the judge does not appreciate john q public trying his own cases  so heres my advice when you find yourself with a ticket  take traffic school if you can  if its a serious matter get a lawyer  a lawyer can present the exact same case as you the difference is the sentence   paul thompson    apple computer

   if we are only talking about 0stroke i think i can understand exhaust pulse affect in a 0stroke the intake valve is closed on the exhaust stroke and the gas is pushed out by the cyclinder  i guess there is some gas compression that may affect the amount pushed out but the limiting factor seems to be the header pipe and not the  canister  meaning would gases so far down the line the canister really have an effect on the exhaust stroke  do the gases really  compress that much      for discussion purposes i will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe and try to paint a useful mental picture  0  unless an engine is supercharged the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is atmospheric  at the time the intake valve is opened the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure left over after the exhaust stroke and atmospheric  as the piston decends on the intake stroke combustion chamber pressure is decreased allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract  at no time does the pressure ever become negative or even approach a good vacuum  0  at the time of the exhaust valve closing the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction the muffler  note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion  0  in the last 00 years the japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning in pursuit of almighty horsepower  at this point in time on highperformance bikes substitution of an aftermarket freeflow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance because the stock intake system flows very well anyway  substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference unless in general the new exhaust system is much louder than the stocker  0  on older bikes  exhaust backpressure was the dominating factor if freeflowing air filters were substituted very little difference was noted unless a freeflowing exhaust system was installed as well  0  in general an engine can be visualized as an air pump  at any given rpm anything that will cause the engine to pump more air be it on the intake or exhaust side will cause it to produce more horsepower pumping more air will require recalibration rejetting of the carburetor    dave tharp                       dod 0000    you cant wear out         davetinterceptorcdstekcom    mra 000       an indian scout          00 k00s  00 indian chief       ahrma 000    or its brother the chief  00 r00s000 00 tr0b000   ama 000000   theyre built like rocks   00 r000velorex  00 nsu max                  to take the knocks             0000 bmw r00               compulsive  its the harleys that       my employer has no idea           joiner      give you grief           
  personally i follow the no alcohol rule when im on a bike  my view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike  if i get hurt its my own fault but i dont want to wreck my katana  i developed this philosophy from an impromptu experiment  i had one beer at 000 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 000  i wasnt even close to leagle intoxication but i couldnt perform even the most basic things until 000  this made     me think about how i viewed alcohol and intoxication  you may seem fine but your reactions may be affected such that youll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind  i greatly enjoy social drinking but for me it just doesnt mix with riding  max enjoyment eric   
    thanks to all of you who gave advice on the cb000 custom   as recommended i had the bike compression tested  compression was a little low but very even across the four cylinders  0 psi  they said that it was tested a little cold so that would explain the low  numbers around 00  does this sound right  otherwise the bike looked great  no signs of road rash and no rust  this bike looks great  it is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires   i am opting for the metzler me00 and me00 tires thanks to those  who posted this other thread  this bike is big compared to my other bikes    sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the kdx000 was   i should be road legal tomorrow  i am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about  the transmission and taking my chances  being a reletively new reader i am quite impressed with all the usefull info available on this newsgroup  i would ask how to get my own dod number but ill probably be too busy riding                                                                                                                                jamie w burnside                                     oo     jburnsidellmitedu                                  c                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
   insurance companies sure seem to go for nofault coverage  since the majority of accidents are the cagers fault doesnt this imply that we would have to pay much higher rates under a nofault system  with a carsonly system it seems to make sense on the surface take the legal costs out of the system  but it looks like motorcyclists would get screwed     michael chuck bain                       meb0000icdfscaboeingcom         semiloud pipes save lives

  for those of you who are thinking about fiamms you might also want to think about airhorns i just installed a set of bosch air horns ordered from  dennis kirk pg 000 of the latest catalog on my 00 fj0000 they are rated at 00db at 0 meters i installed them using 00 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground my stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine i soldered the connections to the relay and compressor and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 00amp fuseconnector from napa i installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing you have to remove the front fairing to do this but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses depending how tight your fairing follows the frame you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing the compressor is about 0 in diameter and about 0 long the relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it i found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount the horns fit inside the front fairingframe and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops but behind the turn signals the back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame there is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into the short horn is even with the fairing and the long one sticks out about an inch or so but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely they end up pointing down slightly and maybe 00 degrees from straight ahead perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you if you have any other questions about the mounting email and i can try to explain better if your bike is not red then you may want to paint them first how do they work you ask they are very very very loud they sound more like a european sports car than a truck but a vast improvement over stock i have used them at least daily since installing them and the 00 amp fuse has not blown yet although the duration of the horn blasts have been short ive repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them even though they know that i have the horns they still jump they are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk the bottom line is they work are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages as well as take a few years off their lives and are relatively easy to install on the fj ymmv  tjk 00 fj0000 with get out of my way horns that looks like a suit youd fight a fire in comment about the aerostich

   we all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle the question is is one of the effect dominant and which one is it the idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar  as you point out the experiments would be difficult but we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations there are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn  0 gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over  0 contact patch having shifted to one side causing bike to fall over  0 contact patch being accelerated to the side causing a torque which twists the bike over  take an average bikerider average bike wheel and at speeds of 0 00 and 00 mph say calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce say 00 degrees of lean in say 0 seconds by each effect alone my guess is that at slow speeds 0 is dominant and at high speeds 0 is dominant and at all speeds 0 contributes not far off bugger all relatively speaking  by the way a similar problem is this how does a runner who wants to run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast is there a running group where we could start counterfooting arguments and have them all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners   chris malcolm    camukacedaifh          00 000 000 0000 department of artificial intelligence    edinburgh university 0 forrest hill edinburgh eh0 0ql uk                dod 000

  im a biker and a doglover  first and foremost i want to mention some common sense  if its a choice between injuringkilling a dog or getting yourself injuredkilled there is only one rational decision  only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first  second its useful to learn how to read a dogs body language  how you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks its a game and that youre playing with him is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent  third its useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog  dogs are social beasts and recognize a dominationsubmission hierarchy  to a dog there are two types of fellowcreatures that which he dominates and that which dominate him  you need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class  you are god you are easily angered and your anger is terrible but god is also amused by one who properly submits to his dominance and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word a kind word or even oh joy oh rapture unforeseen a dog bisquit  now how does that all relate to biking  well first its a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think its a game and not out of overt hostility  the msf suggestion is a very good one when you see the dog coming slow down so he determines a particular place of interception  just before you and he reach that spot punch the throttle so that when he reaches it youre already long gone  dogs take a few seconds to react to new input and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of  with a hostile dog or one which you repeatedly encounter stronger measures may be necessary  this is the face off  first  and there is very important  make sure you never face off a dog on his territory  face him off on the road not on his driveway  if necessary have a large stick rolled up newspaper etc something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him  stand your ground then slowly advance  your mental attitude is that you are very angry and are going to dispense terrible punishment  the larger the dog the greater your anger  dogs will pick up anger just as they can pick up fear  and since you and he are not on his home territory it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory and that you are prepared to fight to the death  most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage  theyll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat gesture of submission and thus they have escaped punishment  the interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great deal to them  the more effective you are at communicating body language the less you actually have to do  after 0 years with my 00 pound beast ive learned a few tricks i think

  karrcscornelledu david karr writes get the organization to act on it is easy to say but says little about what one really can and should do  what the organization actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors as far as i can see  thats what makes it so important to vote in an election of officers  if i remember right i heard that in the last election only 00 of the members actually cast votes i wonder if the current board and their friends and relatives make up 00 of the membership    i certainly plan on staying with the club long enough to vote and to see the results  it does strike me that the bmwmoa is a lot less politically active in the state and national arenas not infighting than other mc organizations  should we change this  or just join the other groups that already are in politics  i wouldnt support the moa becoming politically active in that sense the ama already knows how to do that and id rather see the moa support the ama in a manner that the ama needs i think that more could be accomplished from one strong front rather than two not neccessarily  coordinated ones    joe senner                                                joeridercactusorg austin area ride mailing list                            rideridercactusorg texas splatterfest mailing list                          festridercactusorg

   insurance companies sure seem to go for nofault coverage  since the majority of accidents are the cagers fault doesnt this imply that we would have to pay much higher rates under a nofault system  with a carsonly system it seems to make sense on the surface take the legal costs out of the system  but it looks like motorcyclists would get screwed  yup  unfortunately as has been pointed out the cost of insurance does not go down with no fault  the crappiest drivers make out like bandits because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy drivers  the good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of the crappy drivers actions and thats not fair  any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of shit because the rest of us end up paying more  any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are inherently less safe than slower drivers and the nhtsa disproved that two years ago now  later   chris behannadod 000          0000 hd fxwg wide glide  jubilees red lady behannasylnjneccom          0000 cb000t  baby bike disclaimer  now why would nec  0000 zx00  needs a name agree with any of this anyway    i was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs

   on a waterski bike you turn the handlebars left to lean right just like on a motorcycle  i dont think this is the case at least not on all jetskis  on my friends jetski bars turn left to go left  anyway all youre doing there is changing the yaw of the jets so the relationship between the handlbars and the rearmounted jets is completely arbitrary simple linkage could make it work either way  so this supports the movethecontactpatchfrombeneaththe centreofmass theory on how to lean this contradicts the need for gyroscopic precession to have a countersteering induced lean  it seems to me that jetskis are even more irrelevant to this discussion than snow skis  but it has been an amusing digression  hey ed how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horses reins left to go left    or am i confusing two threads here   phil stone            new address pstonewellsfcaus 00 r00st                                      motorcycles ok

   yo whaz up  earlier i was reading on the net about using splitfire plugs  one guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell  well i saw one think that someone said about show me a team that used split fires  well heres some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages  splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 0x0 cages  well for these guys splitfires increased performance by increasing torque  they werent focusing on horsepower numbers  now how does this related to us high performance pilots  well that depends  do you pilot a high performance 0 or 0cylinder machine in the case of 0cylinders splitfires would increase overall torque but 0s make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low so for 0s splitfires would not significantly increase power  but what about twins  many of you 0 guys laugh at some of us twins but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss see doug polen vs scott russell daytona 0000  however twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands   so how does this translate  increased torque should theoretically help twins make more power  splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made just stick em in  now i dont know about all of this and im trying to catch up with somebody about it now but splitfires should help twins more than 0s          as far as racing teams  ducati team fast by ferraci used splitfires in the 0000 season this is when they had jamie james running for em but i dont know why they stopped since then also somebody check to see if they had them in 00  peace  warren wcd00000uxacsouiucedu have suzuki will travel  at a local fixeruper shop the bike repairest looked at a dumped zx0  then he asked the guy  what happened   i dumped the clutch how fast        pretty fast insurance       nope  the fixer smiled  what do you know about bikes   not much

  so it looks like im going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage for a few months starting several months from now and im already contemplating how to do it so theyre as easy to get going again as possible i have everything under control i think besides the batteries i know that if i buy a 0000 battery tender for each one and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage theyll be fine but im not sure thats necessary ive never heard anyone discussing this idea so maybe theres some reason why it isnt so great but maybe someone can tell me  would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries drain the electrolyte into separate containers one for each battery seal the container close up the batteries and leave them that way then it would seem that when the bikes come out of storage i could put the electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully charged whats wrong with this  on a related but different note for you bay area denizens wasnt there someone who had a bunch of spare edta a few months back who was it is there still any of it left  thanks for any and all help   robert

     after both oil changes the oil level was at the top mark in the window on the lower right side of the motor but ive been noticing that the oil level seen in the window gradually decreases over the miles  im always checking the window with the bike on level ground and after it has sat idle for awhile so the oil has a chance to drain back into the pan  the bike isnt leaking oil any place and i dont see any smoke coming out of the exhaust    my owners manual says the amount of oil corresponding to the high and low marks in the oil level window is approx 0 quart  it looks like my bike has been using about 00 quarts0000 miles  the owners manual also gives a figure for max oil consumption of about 00ozmile or 00l000km    my question is whether the degree of oil consumption im seeing on my bike is normal  have any other k00 owners seen their oil level gradually and consistently go down  should i take the bike in for work  im asking local guys also to get as many data points as i can     its normal for the bmw k bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand  miles  i dont know why  ive had three new k bikes and all three used a bit of oil when new  max maybe 0 quart in first 0000 miles this soon quits and by the time i had 00000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero ive been told that the harder you run the bike within reason the sooner it stops using any oil   charlie smith   charlieelektrocmhnetorg  kotdohl  kotwitdodl  0kspi0000   dod 0000   doh 0000000000    ama moa ra buckey beemers bk ohio v               bmw k0000lt  r00gspd  r00  triumph tr0                            columbus ohio usa

   okay doders heres a goddamn mystery for ya       the stud on the side of the bike that clunked when i turned was absent  im  fairly sure it was there before the event  in fact the thread in  the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact with no evidence of something  having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously      okay all you engineering types how the fk do you explain this   how can you  rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole in alloy without  damaging the thread in the hole     you cant knock a threaded stud out from its hole without destroying  the threads  also part of the stud would still be in the hole  therefore the stud was not in the hole before you touched something  down on that side of the bike dr doom   
  egreeneastsuncom ed green  pixel cruncher writes  in article 000000000zensysueaacuk mjssysueaacuk mike sixsmith writes egreeneastsuncom ed green  pixel cruncher writes   0  all of us that argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand the technique of countersteering  including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner  the underlying physics are a different matter and need not be taught to beginners   agreed  countersteering the technique should be taught for only with understanding of the technique can one develop maximally effective emergency avoidance manuvers  this is really the only thing we disagree on maybe we should agree to disagree i still think  that telling newbies to steer left to turn to the right is unnecessarily confusing when theyll do it anyway if they just get on the bike and ride the damn thing   0 i know exactly whats happening  its those other gits that havent a clue     me too     understanding the physics of traction is fine  but i cannot see how detailed theory like that has any place in a motorcyle training course all you need to know is that maximum traction is obtained with the tyre just beginning to slide against the road  then we are in violent disagreement  while what you state is true it is insufficient to form a traction management policy  available traction increases with applied normal force ie traction available to the front wheel increases as weight shifts under braking forces and correspondingly decreases at the rear  thus a technique of applying both brakes and easing off the rear and increasing pressure on the front can best be learned with an understanding of weight shift and available traction  jeez ed when you started talking about traction management policies i thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway locomotives  the official line here though i do have my doubts about it is that the front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place in practice i suspect most people do what you describe  saying brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless advice to a newbie  he has to go out and slide the tire to find out where that is  it also gives him zero information from which to develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and corresponding weight shift develop  if you dont slide the tyre you have no way of knowing whether youve achieved maximum braking or not im not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can  but if you want to find the limits of the machine you have to go beyond them   in any case for maximum braking if as i suggested you aim to keep both wheels just on the point of sliding then youll be doing exactly as you suggest      
  0  what is buying a bike going to do to my insurance  i turn 00 in  about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now and i need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a  motorcycle is going to insure i live in washington dc if that makes a difference  it depends on the bike once youve found a bike youre interested in call some insurance companies for rates some bikes are much cheaper to insure than you might think my ex000 only costs me 000year in st louis im 00  0  any recommendations on what i should buywhere i should look for it  for a first bike i recommend 000ccs or less and a bike short enough to get both feet on the ground when you stop   the one piece of advice everyone will give you is to take a motorcycle safety foundation riders course see a dealer for details in some states completion of such a course can give you a break on insurance it will also teach you to ride properly from the beginning so you wont learn any bad habits  good luck riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have naked or otherwise  alan

  several years ago while driving a cage a dog darted out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance between us so i didnt have to slow down however a 0nd dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that scottish terrier  apparently it was following the 0st dog henceforth if a dog decides to cross the street keep an eye out for a 0nd dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs   ive yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black gl0000i which has a pretty loud oem horn not as good as fiamms but good enuff but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards id def feel more vulnerable on my 00 trump as thatd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels  if theres a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to the owner i wouldnt be adverse to running over it with my truck as a dogs life isnt worth much imho compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the ground by said dog and dies from a head injury   any dog in the neighborhood thats vicious or a public menace running about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate  graeme harrison gharrisohpcc00corphpcom dod000

     formal training is in my view absolutely essential if youre going to  be able to ride a bike properly and safely but by including countersteering  theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at  the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn  and that was my original point    mike  while i agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding i disagree strongly with your original point the point of formal training  must be to prepare riders for the road preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible so to exclude some aspects of riding a bike  in a course is wrong imho now to countersteering in particular countersteering is something that must be trained a common reaction among  new bikers or bicycle riders in an emergency situation is to steer the  motorcycle like a bicycle as we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended needless to say this is dangerous i have a specific example a rider in a left turn the rider thinks heshe is to close to the right shoulder of the road and tries to steer the  motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right  handle the motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road  a worse scenario the same rider same turn in the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards himher the panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it  the main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency  situations and what to do if in one thus the knowledge and training of countersteering is imho a must in any riding course   staalidtunitno

  hello everyone  im new to motorcycles so no flames please  i dont have my bike yet so i need a few pieces of information    any stories on how you all learned  ill tell you my story as an example of what not to do  early in 0000 i took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old honda cb000t  he had taken the msf beginners course so i actually learned some of what i needed to know to ride  i proceeded to buy a beatup honda cl000 for 000 and a 00 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker  then i decided to invest in a fullface helmet first smart move  sometime around then i also passed my road test  on may 0 0000 i got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 0mile trip  entering the town where i lived a rather urban suburb i had to stop suddenly for a red light that i noticed too late skidded the rear tire out and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic  fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light otherwise i might have slid under a car and been killed  now this is anecdotal evidence to be sure but i later took the experienced rider course from the msf and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly  in your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as i did  so my advice is to take the msf beginners course first thing  i wouldnt even buy a bike until youve taken the course unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until youre ready to use it  0  i only have about 00000000 to work with so that would have  to cover everything bike helmet anything else that im too  ignorant to know i need to buy  while youre waiting to take the course it might take a few weeks in dc as i recall there were always waiting lists in boston could you save up some more money to start out right  say 000 for riding gear plus the cost bike plus maybe 000 guess to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe assuming you economize by buying some old beatup machine from a private individual plus insurance plus registration and licensing fees plus the course youre looking at maybe 000 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance  0  what is buying a bike going to do to my insurance  i turn 00 in  about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now and i need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a  motorcycle is going to insure i live in washington dc if that makes a difference  i pay about 000 insurance now upstate ny but it was closer to 000 in boston more urban for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability which you want unless you plan always to be poor  id guess dc is more like boston than like a rural area ergo more expensive  0  any recommendations on what i should buywhere i should look for it  there used to be annual buyers guides in the usual motorcycle magazines i found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available  you could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available  my first bike was 00 years old when i bought it so i went on my friends advice instead  also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street  i basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of highmileage bmws running around and they were generally set up the way i wanted  nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms  dealers in the boston area at least when i was shopping were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that werent the latest models hence cheaper although i ended up buying both bikes in private sales   david karr karrcscornelledu  00 bmw r00   dod 0000   also bmwmoa nra aclu et al

  i was posting to altlocksmithing about the best methods for securing  a motorcycle  i got several responses referring to the cobra lock described below  has anyone come across a store carrying this lock in the chicago area  it is available through some dealerships who in turn have to back order it from the manufacturer directly  each one is made to order at least if you get a nonstandard length standard is 0 i believe  any other feedback from someone who has used this  see below  in article 0r0000innrajshelleyuwashingtonedu basijisteinuwashingtonedu david basiji writes    incidentally the best lock ive found for bikes is the cobra lock  its a cable which is shrouded by an articulated hardened steel sleeve  the lock itself is cylindrical and the locking pawl engages the joints  at the articulation points so the chain can be adjusted like handcuffs  you cant get any leverage on the lock to break it open and the cylinder  is wellprotected  i wouldnt want to cut one of these without a torch  andor a vice and heavy duty cutting wheel  i have a 0 long cobralinks lock that i used to use for my harley she doesnt get out much anymore so i dont use the lock that often anymore  it is made of 00 articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable it is probably enough to stop all the joyriders but unfortunately professionals can open it rather easily  0 freeze a link  0 break frozen link with your favorite method hammers work well  0 snip through the steel cables which i have on authority are frightfully thin with a set of boltcutters  for the same money you can get a kryptonite cable lock which is anywhere from 00 to 00 thick steel cable looks like steel rope shielded in a flexible covering to protect your bikes finish and has a barreltype locking mechanism  i dont know if its adjustable but my source says its more difficult to pick than most locks and the cable tends to squish flat in boltcutter jaws rather than shear 00 model  all bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute  fyi ill be getting a krypto cable next paycheck  later   chris behannadod 000          0000 hd fxwg wide glide  jubilees red lady behannasylnjneccom          0000 cb000t  baby bike disclaimer  now why would nec  0000 zx00  needs a name agree with any of this anyway    i was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs

      having talked to a couple people about helmets  dropping im getting  about 00 dont sweat it 00 you might think about replacing it and the  other 0 dont ride with it go without a helmet first    is there any way to tell if a helmet is damaged structurally i dropped it  about 0 00 feet to cement off my seat chipped the paint didnt seem to  screw up the actual shell   id bet the price of the helmet that its okayfrom 0 feet or higher maybe not   if i dont end up replacing it in the real near future would i do better  to wear my totally nondamaged 00 face dotrated cheapie which doesnt fit  as well or keep out the wind as well or wearing the shoei rf000 which is a  lot more comfortable keeps the wind out better is quieter but might  have some minor damage  id wear the full facer but then id be way more worried about wind blast in the face and inability to hear police sirens than the helmet being a little damaged    also what would you all reccomend as far as good helmets im slightly  disappointed by how badly the shoei has scratched  etc from not being  bloody careful about it and how little impact it took to chip the paint  and arguably mess it up period looking at a really good fullface with  good venting  wind protection i like the shoei style kinda like the  norton one i saw awhile back too but suspect im going to have to get a  much more expensive helmet if i want to not replace it every time im not  being careful where i set it down  well my next helmet will be subject to it fitting well an agv sukhoi thats just because i like the looks my current one is a shoei task0 and its getting a little old and i crashed in it once a couple of years ago no hard impact to headmy hip took care of that if price was a consideration id get a kiwi k00 i hear they are both good and cheap   christ i dont treat my head as carefully as i treated the shoei as far as  tossing it down and i dont have any bruises on it   be mildly mildly paranoid about the helmet but dont get carried away there are people on the net like those 0 you mentioned that do not consistently live on our planet  regards charles dod0000 rz000   within the span of the last few weeks i have heard elements of separate threads which in that they have been conjoined in time struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing gourd unknown netperson  
  in article mjs000000000zensysueaacuk mjssysueaacuk mike sixsmith writes  no no no no all i am saying is that you dont even need to tell people the  technique of countersteering cos they will do it intuitively the first time they try to go round a corner  some will and others will steer with their tuchuses i dont know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers i was one i guess that i always steered a bicycle that way and i only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding after the course i could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem but i only started using it in my normal riding when i decided that my turning at speed offramps and the like was a lot more difficult that it should have been i knew how it works although thats currently up for debate definitely knew that it works as i could do it in swerves but only figured it out later in my normal riding just a data point i think that its not a bad idea to bring the idea up but its best to let everyone tuchussteer for the first lesson or two so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique  countersteering  in fact my experienced rider course instructors claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike turn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight around even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite direction  i admit ive never actually seen this  i have in our beginner course we had passenger training sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike and the student would take him for a ride if the student did not give the instructor the you are a sack of potatoes passenger speech the instructor would steer the bike and make a general nuisance of himself it was amusing to watch im just happy that it didnt happen to me  ive        bike                      like        jody levine  dod 000 kv      got a       you can        if you      pf   jodyplevinehydroonca                          ride it                  toronto ontario canada  
   on the other side of the fence i owned a bieffe offroad helmet took what i would consider a minor fall and had visible damage to the shell  yes the helmet did its job  but the damageimpact ratio was scary  i own bell moto0 now have taken impacts on order of twice the bieffe impact we do this frequently in mx and dont even have a scratch on it after two seasons  my recommendation is to buy high quality gear  ymmv  when your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object there are only four things to dissipate the energy the immoveable object the helmet shell the helmet liner the riders head the riders ego ok five assuming that the helmet head assembly takes the same impact if the shell cracks in one case then in the other the liner must be dented or the head gets jiggled if its the the liner thats dented the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were cracked it wont absorb energy form an impact in that area if its the head thats getting jiggled maybe the new gear isnt of as high quality after all  ive        bike                      like        jody levine  dod 000 kv      got a       you can        if you      pf   jodyplevinehydroonca                          ride it                  toronto ontario canada

   on 00 apr 00 000000 gmt xlyxvax0citcornelledu said   is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive   yes but the rear wheel comes off the ground not the front  see it just hops into the air  figure john stafford     sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike i had a bmw r000rs that was a wheelie monster of course it didnt have the initial power burst to just twist it into the air  i had to pop the clutch i also had to replace front fork seals a few times as well the fairing is a  bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the time but let me give you fair warning i trashed the ringpinion gear in the final drive of my k00 i assume doing wheelies and this was  no cheap fix either there is some kind of slip device in the shaft to prevent it from breaking unfortunately it didnt save the gears    on the topic of wheelies the other day i saw a kid on a big hurricane do a stoppy or rear wheelie man he had the rear end on this bike  up about 0 feet off the ground at a traffic light i dont recommend these activities anymore now that im an old guy with kids of my own but it looked damn impressive    if you cant keep both tires on the ground at least have em pointed in that direction   cheers  b0

  dsfrom vikingiastateedu dan sorenson  dsryancousineaucompdynquestororg ryan cousineau  writes  dsriding up the hill leading to my dshouse i encountered a liverandwhite springer spaniel no relation to dsthe springer softail or the springer spagthorpe a close relation to dsthe spagthorpe viking  ds        i must have missed the article on the spagthorpe viking  was dsthat the one with the little illuminated dragons head on the front dsfender a style later copied by indian and the round side covers  no not at all the viking was a trick little unit made way back when forties fifties when spag was trying to make a go of it in racing the first iteration the springer was a boxer twin very similar to max frizs famous design but with an overhead point cam see below for more on the valvetrain the problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever the solution was to curve the cylinder bores so that the ground clearance was substantially increased            springer motor front                  viking motor front      this is roughly the idea except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius as the pistons were loath to make a sharpangled turn in the middle of their stroke the engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke  the engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary and still unique overhead cam system through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves  just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the waterwheel which kept the lobe spinning over one side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engines oil pressure came up to normal the engines valve timing would be more or less random resulting in some impressive startup valve damage the solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast remarkably similar to the system used in new porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started the cage however uses an electric oil pump wimps  despite this fix the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner the solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly this was feasible because it was a racing engine  with just a single overhead lobe and no pushrodshaftchain towers because of the hydraulic system the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point                                             lobe                    xx   complex linkage not shown due to  valvestems            complexity                                                                0  piston                                                    note that the tip was not truly vertical                              it was at about a 00 degree angle to the                              ground and this drawing doesnt show the                              curvature because there was none in the                              head itself the bore curve would start                              about where the cylinder bore disappears in                              this diagram   the effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently pundits of the day even said sensuously curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank thus the name  the vik was a moderately successful racer lightning fast when it worked but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology eventually it was dumped when spag finally realized that racing was not where the spagthorpe name would be made the machines were raced for another year or two by privateers and their fate approximately six vikings were made plus one or possibly two springers confusing the issue is one old spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line however no modern record of a production viking has survived and most motorcycle historians discount this story  ryan cousinetc0000 yamaha vision xz000 black pig of invernesslive to ride kotrb          0000 ajs 000 cs king rat                      to work to dod 0000      id be a squid if i could afford the bike    flame to ryancousineaucompdynquestororg     vancouver bc canada   live        slmr 00a  if you arent sliding you arent riding                                                                                                              computer dynamics bbs    0000000000hst    0000000000v00 vancouver bc canada   easy access low rates friendly sysop   
  for the same money you can get a kryptonite cable lock which is anywhere from 00 to 00 thick steel cable looks like steel rope shielded in a flexible covering to protect your bikes finish and has a barreltype locking mechanism  i dont know if its adjustable but my source says its more difficult to pick than most locks and the cable tends to squish flat in boltcutter jaws rather than shear 00 model  fyi ill be getting a krypto cable next paycheck  a word of warning though  kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the kryptonite name  when i obtained my second motorcycle i migrated one of my kryptonite  ulocks from my bicycle to the new bike  i then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle  for about the same money 00 i had the choice of a kryptonite cable lock advantages lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both kryptonite name or a cheesy noname ulock advantages real steel i chose the kryptonite cable  after less than a week i took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy noname ulock  first the krypto cable i bought is not made by kryptonite is not covered by the kryptonite guarantee and doesnt even approach kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance  it is just some generic madeintaiwan cable lock with the kryptonite name on it  secondly the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke  i dont know if mine was a particularly poor example but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage and sometimes it would seem to engage only to fall open when i went to unlock it  thirdly the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the  dark  i didnt try it obviously but i have my doubts that the  lock mechanism would stand up to an insert screwdriver and torque attack  fourthly the cable was not in my opinion of sufficient thickness to  deter theft for my piece of crap bicycle that is  all cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time  if you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers  aviation snips would go  through the cable in well under a minute           michael robinson                          uucp   ucbvaxcogscirobinson                                         internet robinsoncogsciberkeleyedu

   hey ed how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horses reins left to go left    or am i confusing two threads here  three actually  i believe i discussed countersteering a horse before  basically there are two ways to steer a horse plowrein and neckrein  plowreining steers him by keeping the reins separate and you pull in the direction you wish to go  neckreining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand and pulling against the horses neck in the direction you wish to go  when training a plowsteering horse to neckrein one technique is to cross the reins under his necks  thus when neckreining to the left the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit which the horse is used to from his plowreining days  are you sorry you asked yet   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

       request for opinions     which is better  a onepiece aerostitch or a twopiece aerostitch      were looking for more than well the 0pc is more versatile but the     0pc is better protection     thanks in advance    nadine   what is best books have been written on that but in regard to aerostich it really depends on your particular size shape and needs if you upper and lower body are not proportional according to aero dimensions then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching the 0 piece suit i have the 0 piece suit and i am very happy with it having my life quota of scars from crashing off road i am very concerned with good protection and i believe that the difference in protection between the 0 and 0 piece suits is almost negligible i think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference one thing that is nice about the 0 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while still with jacket you can just detach and stow the pants   one thing to note is that goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women with standard suits supposedly for smaller women and petite men for that matter the 0 piece will fit better   another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them i wish i got 00 inches added to my pant legs i find the long suits are not really that long i cant imagine how short the standard suits must be    jonathan e polito     internet jpolitoencorecom encore computer corp 000 kildaire farm rd cary nc  00000  usa 0000000000voice  0000000000fax

   i can file a complaint about this and actually have the chance to have something done how who where  a traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime thats why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you want one you are still innocent until proven guilty  cops are not the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes anyone who witnesses a crime can do so  go to the highway patrol and explain the situation give them a description of the car and the license number and tell them the specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute ie search the vehicle code and have the section number handy  fill out the ticket and sign it  it will go through the same system any ticket a cop writes goes through  if contested you will have to appear in court to prosecute  your word will not carry the same weight as a cops   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

   i was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my stock harley pipes make enough noise to draw someones attention  sure there are horns but my hand is already on the throttle should we get into how many feet a bike going 00mph goes in 00 seconds or how long it would take me to push my horn button  if we do i think youd loose  sure youre hands already on the throttle  and your thumb is already near the horn button  pushing the horn button is one simple move  revving the throttle requires either engaging the clutch or accelerating  the first is a more complex manuver than a simple horn button push and the second aint too bright when there is a potential hazard ahead  besides the unique sound of a horn is more effective in attracting the attention of bdi cagers than is the sound of an engine which is what they expect to hear you are on the road  as is usually the case a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound safety procedure  the answer is 00000 feet   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

   secondly it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the  motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles and not the knowledge of physics between the riders ears are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competently than you could manage otherwise  if hes not i will  put two riders on identical machines  its the one who knows what hes doing and why that will be faster  it may be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is through trial and error but it is not very effective methodology only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique i hold that this applies to any human endeavor  thats all it is  an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster or better as a result is absurd  do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction  braking  it is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques  for most of his riding life this may not be a problem but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage  but by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn  i disagree  the existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing nor detracts from any other aspects of the course  and that was my original point  perhaps but in the ensuing discussion you strayed far from that point to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a riders ability  i find this assertion ludicrous   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

   so the question i have is how dangerous is riding              tough question  more dangerous than driving a car and far more dangerous if you dont apply a modicum of intelligence to the  activity  basically stupidity will get you hurtkilled a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car  but with care it is not unreasonably dangerous  also buying good protective clothing is helpful that way if something does go wrong you are likely to be less severely injured  first thing if possible take a msf driver training course this will get you started on the right foot  they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices  second buy protective gear  at minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must  a good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful though leather hiking boots a pair of old army boots or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied  after those a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well but these are also expensive items  for the pants many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight  similarly for a jacket a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants  another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a secondhand leather jacket  look for a fairly thick leather in these items  third dont do anything stupid  dont ride after  drinking even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance dont ride in the snow or when conditions are such that black ice is likely be very careful riding in the rain  slow way down take corners gingerly  brake early and gently  try not to ride if you are sick tired taking any medication with drowsiness warnings or otherwise not in average shape  with care you should be ok  the next question i have is what bike would you recommend for a first time rider i dont want to race nor do i want to ride cross country nor do i want to ride on dirt trails ill probably drive it on back roads with occasional rides on city streets and freeways the maximum i can spend is about 0000 so ill be looking at a used bike  i would suggest mid to late 00s japanese midsized standard something in 000000 cc range would probably be reasonable  if you are shorterlighter than average you might want to go as low as a 000000 cc bike  possible models  the suzuki gs series eg gs000 gs000 etc  these are generally inline 0 bikes generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system  stator andor regulatorrectifier  problems  my first bike was a about 00 gs000 it server me well  the honda nighthawk series this may also be known as the cb series i think  eg honda cb000 cb000 etc  this is another series of standard motorcycles  also fairly dependable  kawasaki and yamaha probably have similar bikes but i dont know them as well  for mid to late 00s models of the above you should be able to buy the bike for under 0000 leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs  hope this helps david dagibbsqnxcom

  sixteen days i had put off test driving the honda st0000  finally the 00th was a saturday without much rain  in fact it cleared up  became warm and sunny and the wind died  about three weeks ago i took a long cool ride on the hawk down to cycles 000 for a test ride they had sold and delivered the demo st0000 about fifteen hours before i arrived  and the demo vfr was bikelocked in the showroom  surrounded by 000 other bikes and not likely to move soon  today was different  there were even more bikes  00 used dirt bikes 00 used street bikes 00 cars and a big tent full of outlandishly fat touring bikes with trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot some sort of fat bike convention  shelly and dave were running one msf course each at the same time  one in the classroom and one on the back lot  plus there was the usuall free cookout food that cycles gives away every weekend in the summer  hmmm it seemed like a big moto party  after about ten minutes of looking for rob c cheif of sales slime and another 0 minutes reading and signing a long disclosurelibility praytogod form i helped jt push the st out into the mess in the parking lot  we went over the the controls i put the tank bag from  the hawk into the right saddlebag and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag   thats nice   having helped push the  st out to the lot i thought it best to have jt move it to the edge of the road away from the 000 bikes and 000 people  he rode it like a bicycle  it cant be that heavy i thought  well i was wrong  as i sat on the st both feet down all i could  think was big  then i put one foot up  heavy came to mind very quickly  with cindy on the back  was she on the back  hard to  tell with seat three times as large as a hawk seat  the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road  by 0000 rpm in second gear all the weight seemed to dissappear  even on bike with 00 miles on the odometer slippery new tires and pads that  did not yet bite the disks things seems smooth and sure  cycles is on a section of 000 that few folks ever ride  about 00 miles north of the computer concentration about five miles north of where i00 splits away 000 is a lighly travelled two lane limited access highway  it goes through heavily forested sections of hamilton  manchesterbythesea and newbury on its way to gloucester on its way there it meets 000 a road that winds from the sea about 00 miles inland to andover  on its way it goes through many thoroughly new england spots  perfect if slow sport touring sections  cindy has no difficulty with speed  0rd gear 0th gear purring along in top gear  this thing has less low rpm grunt that my hawk  lane  changes were a new experience  a big heft is required to move this  thing  responds well though   no wallowing or complaint  behind the fairing it was fairly quiet but the helmet buffeting was nontrivial  top gear car passing at 00mph was nearly effortless smooth smooth smooth   not sure what the v0 sound reminds me of but it is pleasant  if only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz  the jump on to 000 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes  its a down hill reversing camber twicereversing radius decreasing radius turn  a real squeeze is needed on the front binder   the section of 000 we were on was tight but too urban  the st works ok in this section but it shows its weight  we went by the clam shack oft featured in spencer for hire  a place where you could really  find spencer his house was about 00 miles down 000  after putting through traffic for a while we turned and went back to 000  about half way through the onramp i yanked cindys wrist our singal for hold on tight  head check left  time to find redline  second gear gives a good shove  third too  fourth sees dod speed with a  short shift into top  on the way to 000 we saw no cops and very light traffic  did not cross into dod zone because the bike was too new well now it had 00 miles on it so it was ok  tried some high effort lane changes some wide sweeping turns  time to wick it up  i went  until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat  and stayed there  when i was comfortable with the wind and the steering  i looked down to find an indicated 000mph  not bad for 0up touring  beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit  at the get off in a mile sign i rolled off the throttle and coasted  i wanted to readjust to the coming slowness  it was a good idea  there were several manholesized patches of sand on the exit ramp  back to the  slow and heavy behavior  cycles is about a mile from 000  i could  see even more cars stacked up outside right when i got off  i managed to thread the st through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front  heavy  it took way too much effort for cindy and i to put the thing on the center stand  i am sure that if i used the side stand the st would have been on its side within a minute   my demo opinion  heavy  put it on a diet  smooth comfortable hardly notices the dod speed   id buy on for about 0000 less than  list just like it is  too much  for the bike as it is    frank evan perdicaro xyvision

  gs0000e  its a great bike but youd better be damn careful   i got a 0000 as my third motorcycle  deleta the bike is light for its size i think its 000 pounds but heavy for a beginner bike  heavy for a beginner bike it is 000 pounds it isnt except maybe in some admans dream  with a full tank its in the area of 000 lbs depending on year etc  youre 00  you should have no problem physically managing it  the seat is roughly akin to a plasticcoated 0by0  very firm to very painful depending upon time in the saddle  the 0000 and 00 versions had a much better seat imo  the bike suffers from the infamous suzuki regulator problem  i have so far avoided forking out the roughly 000 for the suzuki part by kludging in different honda regulatorrectifier units from junkyards  the charging system consistently overcharges the battery  i have to refill it nearly weekly this in itself is not so bad but battery access is gained only after removing the seat the tank and the airbox  my regulator lasted over 000000 miles and didnt overcharge the battery the wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though tending to melt their insulation  i suspect they were underspecified it didnt help that they were well removed from cool air  battery access on the earlier bikes doesnt require tank removal after you learn the drill its pretty straightforward   replacement parts like all suzuki parts are outrageously expensive  having bought replacement parts for several brands of motorcycles ill offer a grain of salt to be taken with dales assessment   good luck and be careful dale  sentiments i cant argue withor wont  dean deeds deedsvulcan0edsghaccom

   this person is 000 lbs and fairly small so i dont see weight as too much of a problem but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go i want her to hold onto me     rather than the grab rail out back and ive heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction were turning so she leans with me but what else  are there traditional signals for slow down or go faster or i hafta go pee etc  ive never liked my passengers to try and shift their weight with the turns at all i find the weight shift can be very sudden and unnerving its one thing if theyre just getting comfortable or decide to look over your other shoulder but i dont recommend having himher shift her weight with each turn too violent  also i think someone already said this make sure your passenger wears good gear i sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or lacking other safety gear depends on how squidly i feel but i wont let passengers do it what i do to myself i can handle but i wouldnt want to hurt anyone else so i dont let them on without gloves jacket at least jeans heavy boots and a helmet that fits  i really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that shell want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated  go real easy its amazing how solid a grip you have on the handle bars that your passenger does not dont make her feel like shes going to slide off the back and snappy turns for you are sickening lurches for her in general it feels much less controlled and smooth as a passenger i cant stand being on the back of my brothers bike and i ride aggressively when i ride and i know hes a good pilot still everything feels very unsteady when youre a passenger    thanks         bob  show off by not showing off the first time out   this is where i wanna sit and buy you a drink someday  temple of the dog seabass sears  scs0cunixbcccolumbiaedu  dod000  stanley id  00 yamaha xs000f  00 bmw r000s  00 toyota 0runner      nyc ny

  one point not yet mentioned hands on the drivers shoulders are a definite nono  it feels good for the passenger to stretch her arms and a shoulder massage feels good too but the shoulders are connected to the arms and the arms to the handlebars  should you hit the brakes the pressure on the shoulders can make steering interesting  bundle her up if its cold make sure she has good gear say it again an pat her thigh to let her know all is great  good luckmike

  since at least one other person was interested in this  my fzrs black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired yesterday i bought a can of vht 0000 degree black header paint and spent an hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand  sprayed on paint  thought about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that i wouldnt be at all suprised if the paint worechipped off in a month  soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder coating while extremely durable will not handle over 000 degree temperatures  the place i talked to said they were experimenting with some new powder that is supposed to handle 0000 degrees but that it wouldnt be available for months at least  they directed me to another shop that specializes in header coating  the other shop said they have 0 coatings available  one is aluminized that can do 0000 degrees and is comparable to powder coating for durability the other is silicon i think based and can do 0000 degrees  but is thinner and not as durable  both coatings have a textured finish not super smooth and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush  price for 0 0foot header pipes and a 0foot 000 collector was 000  im planning to take the parts up friday and get them back ups next week maybe wednesday  sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint considering how much abuse the pipes get from road craprocks  axel

  mjssysueaacuk mike sixsmith writes mjsno no no no all i am saying is that you dont even need to tell people mjsthe technique of countersteering cos they will do it intuitively the first mjstime they try to go round a corner  karrcscornelledu david karr writes karrare you sure  remember that you can get around corners without karrcountersteering  in fact my experienced rider course instructors karrclaimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike karrturn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight karraround even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite karrdirection  i admit ive never actually seen this  ive experienced this back when i was younger and more foolish  my first bike used to track extremely true  going down the highway i would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas steady slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest riding without any hands  if i needed to turn id shift my weight into the turn and lo and behold the bike would turn sans touching the bars granted it wouldnt turn very fast but it proves that you can turn a bike without countersteering at least not in terms of the input to the bar normally associated with countersteering  as ive said i know many people who think all you do is lean and any input theyre giving to the bar is totally unconscious  whereas that may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances possibly for years at a stretch i cant think of anybody whod argue that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar in a turn regardless of what you want to call it  except maybe for mr sixsmith    mr bill    bill leavitt 000    00 cbx white lightning 00 gs000g suzibago     leavittcsumdedu  00 cj000 little honda 00 lone star sick leave    dod ama icoa nia   00 impala convertible the incredible hulk others   hmmm i thought bore and stroke was the technique michael bain 000   
  hola amigos  quiero i need an answer to a pressing question  i now own two bikes and would love to keep them both  one is a capable and smooth street bike low and lightweight with wide power and great brakes the other is a beemer gs kind of rough for the city but great on the long road and backroad  a good start at a stable but i dont think its going to work  unfortunately insurance is going to pluck me by the short hairs    unless some insurance agent offers a multivehicle discount  they do this all the time for cars assuming that youre only capable of  driving one of the things at a time  i dont think ill ever manage to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street turn left accelerate the zephyr turn right accelerate the beemer  does anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to discount your rates  state farm doesnt  by the way im moving to the bay area so ill be insuring the bikes there and registering them  to ease me of the shock can somebody guesstimate the cost of insuring a zr000 and a r000gs  here in tucson they only cost me 000 full and 000 liability only for the two per annum  muchas gracias enrique  
     i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 000 ninja    this will be the the first time ive taken anyone for an extended ride    read farther than around the block    well be riding some twisty     fairly bumpy roads the mines roadmthamilton loop for you sf bay areans  communication  work out your own system  or just slow down and holler back every once in a while  at reasonable speeds even on my undermuffled magna we can hear each other  its only above say 00 mph that you  cant really communicate  balance new passengers are a real pain because you never know how theyre going to react to steering  some people catch on immediately and lean with me  others are completely skittish about the leaning thing and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon  this is a pain while turning but manageable  the worst are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon then remember in the middle of a turn and whip around until theyre in the correct position  this always screws up the line ive picked out  heres my personal checklist of things to tell passengers  attire helmet long pants bootsheavy shoes jacket  keep feet on pegs at all times unless i say otherwise  do not   get onoff unless i say you can  ive had people try to dismount   in traffic just as im pulling in to a parking space  muffler gets hot nuff said  we get good traction  were not going to fall over  many   firsttime riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn  turn dynamics  sit so that you feel like youre sitting upright and   were going straight  trust your butt not your eyes  if youre   confused close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel   of it  or just hug me tight    please no sudden moves  shift your weight as desired but be    gradual so i can compensate  your faceplate is yours to openclose as desired  trust is essential  trust the driver me to do the right    thing  ive driven many miles on this thing and know how   to operate it  enjoy the ride  this is important to   stress  for example one of my firsttime passwngers seemed to    watch the speedo like a hawk  i drove her to the beach down 00    and whever we topped 00 mph shed holler slow down im scared    i humored her for a while then simply covered the speedometer with    the spare piece of duct tape i keep stuck to the top of the cluster   problem solved  she watched the scenery instead of the   instruments and had a much better time  based on her   experience driving a lincoln continental she was unwilling to    trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike  usually ill point out the controls engine transmission brakes  tires etc and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for firsttimers helps calm their nerves and gives the bike a chance to warm up  watch out for gravel on the mt hamilton road  there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain by now many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little round nearly invisible stones it doesnt help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner on the  first trip  good luck  have fun  dont drink soap dilute dilute ok

   yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar to countersteering  basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to occur to the left  this sounds suspiciously like black magic to me  if by quick wiggle to the right you mean that the handlebars turn toward the right before turning to the left what is the input to the steering mechanism that makes this happen in the absence of the old shoveshove   david karr karrcscornelledu  00 bmw r00   dod 0000   also bmwmoa nra aclu et al

  to followup i had a bad experience w a krypto lock too  last year i bought a krypto cable ii 00x00 long something like that that by all standards seemed like a decent piece  until i used it anyway     so in short the 00 cables seems to be pretty useless i would guess    the larger cable seems to be a much better unit    ive got the larger cable  about 00 inch in diameter actually i think its larger about 0 feet long which coils into a 0 or 0 inch coil with the tubular key lock like the ulocks  it has worked fine for me for two years now and seems to me anyway that it is very secure  it doesnt have the weaknesses that the ulocks have other than the liquid nitrogen trick supposedly is much easier to store in my tankbag than a ulock and more versatile  i got mine from one of the mailorder houses motorcycle accessory warehouse i beleive for 00    in combination with an ignition disable and a couple of other deterrents all i usually worry about is vandalism  randy davis                            email randymegatekcom zx00 00000 pilot                            uunetucsdmegatekrandy dod 0000         but this one goes to eleven  nigel tufnel spinal tap

   i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 000 ninja  this will be the the first time ive taken anyone for an extended ride  read farther than around the block    well be riding some twisty   fairly bumpy roads the mines roadmthamilton loop for you sf bay areans     an extended ride as a passenger on a 000 ninja  owww  well i hate to be a wet sock but well  i was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before i started riding myelf and i grew to hate long rides on sport bikes  the passenger seats are not designed for long rides  the passenger positions arent even usually designed for short rides  i ended up torturing my knees and my back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes  one of the reasons i originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had a bmw   id suggest a shorter extended ride at first  a short turn in the mountains or some such  then see how much pain shes in and proceed from there  the best advice id give a beginning passenger   dont get on the bike until the rider says its ok and work out some sort   signal for the rider to tell you when its ok to get off  after i get on    the bike i squeeze my riders hips to tell that im ready and at the stop   he nods his head to show its ok for me to get off   keep your feet on the pegs at all times  dont wiggle unless your rider   asks you to    the best passengers are those which are unobtrusive  echo the movements   and lean of your rider  look over the shoulder thats most comfortable   but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn   get used to your riders shifting style riders  use a reasonably   consistent shifting style  avoid helmet bonk  helmet bonk is    when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change   in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk hishers  it   gets old real fast   when pulling to a stop put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep   your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank  putting your hands   on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if youre in pain   but im told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there   switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders but be    sure and squeeze your thighs while youre doing it so your rider knows youre   still there   the guard rail isnt as safe as holding onto your rider   dont be afraid to ask for frequent stops if youre in pain or   losing feeling in your feet  passenger seats are not generally designed    for comfort  work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand      laura lemay                              lemaynetcomcom writer of trifles in shadows and blood

  sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human we have all the advantages  i agree with this 000 after all when you grab under his chin and are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head what is he going to do  tailwag you to death i even had one occasion where i was unexpectedly jumped by a 000 lb german shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other now im holding his mouth open no way is he strong enough to clamp down and he can do nothing  however all this macho shit aside the fact is that when you are riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly  by all means if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention stop and stay there if you kick the dog and ride away that is a victory for the dog  it drove you out of its territory it is not even a qualified victory it is a victory if you kick it and stop and sit there 00 of dogs will say oh shit this guys serious and back off now you have established your dominance over the dog and it probably will not bother you again  llamas however are a different story if you stop near a llama it will just hop on and insist on a ride and thats if youre lucky if it doesnt like you itll barf you off the bike and steal it   curtis jackson   cjacksonmvusadobecom00 hawk gt00 maxim 000 dod0000 kotb  00 black lab mix studley doright  00 colliegolden george there is no justification for taking away individuals freedom  in the guise of public safety  thomas jefferson

  i bought a yamaha xs000 with 0k miles  over the last 0 years ive put 00k of commute miles onnit  valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every 0k  well every 00k or so ive checked the pad clearences and they never change  if anything the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which makes no sense to me with the pad system  the pads should wear until the clearances are too great right  i know that threaded adjusters can tighten  up but i didnt think these kind could  bottom lines is that i havent touched my valves for 00k on this bike and they are still nice and quiet and if anything the clearances are tighter whats the deal  any other yam triple owners notice extremely long valve adjustment intervals

   egreeneastsuncom ed green  pixel cruncher writes  basically there are two ways to steer a horse plowrein and neckrein  plowreining steers him by keeping the reins separate and you pull in the direction you wish to go  neckreining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand and pulling against the horses neck in the direction you wish to go  when training a plowsteering horse to neckrein one technique is to cross the reins under his necks  thus when neckreining to the left the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit which the horse is used to from his plowreining days  i learned when riding bareback as a kid to palmreign by just  pushing on the right side of the horses neck with your right palm to turn  left  a lot like countersteering so that came pretty easy to me in the  transition to motorcycles it took a while however to break my habit of  kicking the rear fender with my heels to go faster  steve  steve l moseley                                  moseleyuwashingtonedu microbiology sc00                                phone 000 0000000 university of washington                          fax   000 0000000 seattle wa 00000  
  do any honda gurus know if i can replace the  the front sprocket on my 0000 honda cb000k with a slightly larger one i see this as being preferable to reducing the size of the rear one  thats a twincam right  theres a steel guard right next to the sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the engine cases and its needed  theres probably not enough room to fit a bigger sprocket  id be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a 0 ratio change rather than adding one to the front for about 0  if you raise the overall gear ratio too much youll impair the bikes rideability because the gears will be far enough apart that there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at any given speed  honda 000s dont have the widest of power bands       chuck karish          karishmindcraftcom     000 0000000 x000   karishpangeastanfordedu

  in article 00000rdhydroonca jlevinerdhydroonca jody levine writes in article 0qc000c0rsixguneastsuncom egreeneastsuncom writes  singletrack snow vehicles with front skis and snow skis attached to skiers legs deform the surface of the snow creating their own bank ice skates alter the phase of the ice and also carve out their own tracks so what   so they have bugger all to do with motorcycles  hence any apparent similarity in handling characteristics may or may not be analagous in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling characteristics  ok as one last attempt ill take a different tack  we all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle the question is is one of the effect dominant and which one is it the idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar  lets look at the one that so far has sparked no controversy on its own gyroscopic precession to examine this alone we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force the wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike through suspension so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way similar to a bikes an experiment would be to ride a bike along  a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning then change  surfaces to something that wont transmit forces through the contact  patches and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans it  probably would since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice  but we wouldnt get a good idea of how well or what it feels like  because without the contact patches we cant turn  maybe theres a  better way besides even ice doesnt get rid of the contact patch forces altogether so wed have to find a really frictionless surface youd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it  looking at the contactpatch effect only however is fairly simple now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle but without rotating wheels how it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant were just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways and skis or skates would do fine i dont know of any snowski or skate bikes but up here we have the suzuki wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels i think the propellor is in front of the rear ski or something like that but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect now i admit that this is second hand info although id love to try one of these but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle in that you countersteer it to turn so we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bikes a similar suspension arrangement and no gyroscopes but we do have countersteering  conclusion you dont need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcyclelike contact patch arrangements we still dont know what real effect the gyroscopes have when theyre there but from my observations of how handlebar angle force etc relate to steering in general im  willing to bet that theyre not the dominant factor in countersteering   if you dont like this conclusion then dont accept it but my motorcycles behaviour is consistent with it if someone can prove otherwise go ahead  ive        bike                      like        jody levine  dod 000 kv      got a       you can        if you      pf   jodyplevinehydroonca                          ride it                  toronto ontario canada  
  do i have to be the one to say it  dont be so stupid as to leave your helmet on the seat where it can fall down and go boom  true enough i put it on the ground if its free of spooge or directly on my head otherwise  that kind of fall is what the helmet is designed to protect against  not exactly the helmet has a lot less energy if your head isnt in it and theres no lump inside to compress the liner against the shell is a drop off the seat enough to crack the shell i doubt it but you can always send it to be inspected  ive        bike                      like        jody levine  dod 000 kv      got a       you can        if you      pf   jodyplevinehydroonca                          ride it                  toronto ontario canada  
  the other day it was raining cats and dogs therefor i was going only to the speed limit on nothing more on my bike this guy in his bmw was driving 00 meters behind me for 0000 meters and at the next red light i calmly put the bike on its leg walked back to this car he rolled down the window and i told him he was a total idiot and the reason why  did i do the right thing  well i used to get mad and either try to communicate my anger to jerks or to uhm educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic now i just try to get them off my tail  in heavy traffic i slow down a bit mostly so i have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind but i also often find that the  jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes switch into one of them and pass me  which is fine because then i can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind while looking ahead rather than from in front while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors  in traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass i might pull over as if to look for a street number or name still ignoring the jerk just to get the jerk off my tail    if this all sounds well wimpy or undenizenly or pessimistic or perhaps  for any psych types passiveaggressive consider that i prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding rather than from yelling at jerks    a ride can improve my whole day while yelling at a jerk is likely for me to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger  in the worst case yelling at the jerk could ruin my life  since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed with the cage than i am on a bike   on the other hand you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic and thus off your tail or crossing illegally hopefully in front of the waiting police  like almost everything here your choices and mileage will vary   denis mckeon galwaychtmeeceunmedu

  about a year and half ago when i first started riding i took a msf course i have taken those lessons to heart  over the past year i have had only a few  near collisions with traffic morons on four wheels  yesterday i got to add another to the list but with this one i felt the most helpless  i am sitting at a light about 0  0 car lengths behind a car a wise decsion  suddenly i  hear screeching tires  i dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize its the  moroon flying up right behind me in my panic i pop my clutch and stall the bike  luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel  i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you really in actuality avoid such an incident  suggestions  
  the tachometer has a sticker right on it that says for the first 000  miles do not go over 0000 rpms and for the next 000 miles dont go over 0000  referred to as the breakin period if you didnt know  well if i were to do that i would never be going over 00 mph even in 0th gear  so my question is will it hurt my new cycle to take it up  in the 00000 rpm range so that i can at least go the speed limit  but you already can go at the speed limit at 0000 rpm  all you need to do is to find a road with a 00 mph speed limit  this isnt quite as silly as it sounds  if you take a nice day trip over back roads not highways full of people trying seriously to get from here to there then you might be able to hold 00 mph comfortably you could easily do 000 miles over three different weekends  you might even get to enjoy some of the scenery  yes i know this is probably not why you bought a 000 called ninja   david karr karrcscornelledu  00 bmw r00   dod 0000   also bmwmoa nra aclu et al

   i am having trouble starting keeping running my 0000 cbr000f0  i have had problems with it since last year but it seemed to have subsided  now its back again  problem persists regardless of choke usage pattern gasoline type brand  octane and pretty much anything else i can imagine to change  the dealer is stumped its still under warranty  i start the bike  it runs great for a while 0000 seconds then the engine starts to slow down  decreasing the idle setting will increase the engine speed  increasing the choke increases the engine speed  regardless the engine will eventually slow down and stop    once stopped it will not restart even after flooded engine drill  if i let it sit 0000 minutes it starts beautifully and runs great for ever so i go out ride it hard for 000 miles and bring it back ride it easy  for a few miles to let it cool down and put it away  next day i go thru the same drill to get it going  any ideas  has anyone seen this before  another f0 rider had similiar problems and this is the mail i sent him hope this helps resolve you problem  at      allen tobias writes    check the vent tube to the tank sometimes the tube is clogged or constricted    this prevents gas from flowing into the carbs because of the vacuum created by    the displacement of the gasoline this is the small tube on the bottom of the     tank the large tube is the overflow you will have to remove the left side    tail section to get access to this area         good luck      but if it was clogged wouldnt this interfere with engine operation all  the time  when it runs it runs well    good point did not catch this in the original post the only other things  which come to mind since this is a gravity feed fuel system is this the fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the 0 carburator let suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the vacuum valve in the fuel petcock when it is cold the hole is open enough to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on  since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas  and as the engine and surrounding area warm up the hole seals up   one way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side  panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs connect a tube of the  correct size preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow on the output side of the fuel petcock remove the control hose from 0 carburator make sure the tank is full place the valve in the on position and apply vacuum  to the control hose preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge to check  for air leaks with vacuum applied fuel should flow freely to see if there is a vent problem do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed if it  flows a lot faster with the filler cap open then there may be something in  the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog  or partially clog the vent i have heard of some f0 fuel tanks being replaced  to fix this problem so the things which might be defective are the control hose from 0 carb the petcock valve and possibly the fuel tank vent  now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold then there  is something in the carbs screwed up but there are so many things to check  i would be typing all day to list them all   here are a few with everything back together apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow open up the airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs there are quite a few on each carb  i hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting if american honda does not resolve this get mad as hell and report them to the bbb and call the honda customer service hotline it is a 000 number but i dont recall it off the top of my head i called just about tires for my f0 and a few days later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how i liked the support i received here would be your chance to tell them what you think  buy the service manual on the f0 it is an invaluable source of information for working on your bike and i might add trouble shooting

  so how do i steer when my hands arent on the bars open budweiser in  david gibbs replies just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer ill supply one  yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar to countersteering  basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to  i guess i was semiserious without using my hands i lean and the bike  turns when leaning a torque is applied at a 00deg angle to the front  wheels axle just as in countersteering however this torque is also about  00deg from the axis of the steering head instead of making the  bike lean gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn but i dont remember  which way  rick  oh yeah i tried this in the driveway on the centestandas suggested  somewhere else but it doesnt seem to work the same     rick clarke  clarkebdrcbdcom ama somethingsomething

   i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you really in actuality avoid such an incident  suggestions  an even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and the car in front but enough to manuver around it  keep the bike in 0st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in hows that for engageddisengaged until there are two cars stopped behind you  when the next bdi cager comes screaching in simply ride up along side of the car in front of you  you dont need to panic and do it or you will pop the clutch and stall the engine  do is smoothly just rapidly  the cage in front of you will provide much better protection than anything else particularly empty road   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

  this is maybe not a pet peeve but definitely a playmate peeve  any lock including the kyptonite utypes are easy to break into if the person has the proper supplies andor motivation 0 minutes and your bike is gone i would be glad to explain but i dont want to contribute to any unlawful activities   does this make anyones skeptic alarm tm go off  no offense bill i dont mean to say that youre not being straight but i wonder how you know about this  have you actually every used your secret method to break all the different kinds of bike locks  or are you taking someones word for it  the fact is it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to go into a successful bikestealing business because they read anything in recmotorcycles  so please tell us what you are talking about  we cant even protect against an assault or discuss methods if you dont come out with it  see i have heard the ones about the pipes and the liquid nitrogen and the cordless dremel tools and a bunch of other ones  the most plausable method i am not a bike thief so i really dont know for certain is just to put a rod through each wheel and use four guys to just lift the bike into a truck  this works because most people dont lock their bikes to anything since that method is so childishly easy i figure a nice visible chain or cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on to the next bike  hey finally an advantage to the weight and high cg of the concours    especially since i have a bike that i would hate to see ripped off by such a trival tactic warning no lock alone is a safe deterent against theft the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lockpicker to walk away with your property  i personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned  what tactic are you referring to  if we dont know what you are talking about we cant very well guard against it can we  for my money literally i rely on a combination of a motiondetector alarm with pager when im out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area cc insurance and i try to park in obvious visible areas with lots of people about  see if someone just plays with the bike without intention of stealing it at least some eyes are on it and if they get too rambunctious theyll set off the alarm  thats for a nice bike  for a ratbike the trick is to always keep its actual value well below bluebook so that it looks so crappy nobody would want to steal it and even if they were stupid enough to you would make a profit on the deal    seriously if i for instance need to go on a business trip for a week and sadly have to leave the bikes sitting they both get a shittylooking but useable cover locked on and both bikes locked to each other and a curb bumper in the parking lot under the light  i usually rig the cable locks i use aircraft cable so that if anyone pulls on either bike or the cable joining them the concours alarm goes off  and i have a friend come buy every day to have a look and make sure theyre still there  the only thing i have ever had stolen was a 00 cover and that was over  winter storage with the battery out of the bike and thus no alarm  oh put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through and place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off  thats the best that i can think of  most of the locks i see people put on bikes look well not too mechanically sound  i like abus since i have personally removed master locks from lockers with my boot  dave svoboda svobodavoidrtsgmotcom     im getting tired of 00 concours 0000 mmmmmmmmmm                beating you up dave 00 rz 000 ring ding woops                you never learn ama 000000  dod 0000  cog 000  chicago      beth bruiser dixon

  my kawasaki kz 000 l0 has 00 millimetres of play on the gearchange pedal axle in other words i can move the axle sideways  upanddown for few millimetres to each direction this doesnt bother me when riding but i guess fixing it wouldnt hurt last summer i took the bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted and the mechanic mentioned that it should be an easy job all i would have to do is to remove the front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that i would find there well upon a closer inspection i discovered that the gearchange axle doesnt even run through the sprocket cover it seems that in addition to removing the cover i would have at least to remove the sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket  question  would removing this small cover from the left side of the engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushingseal dont know the exact term in english sorry   question  has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some other purpose  does the oil for example stay inside the engine   thanks   teppo nieminen dod 0000 zoo mc helsinki finland

  rwertwellsfcaus bob wert writes  are there traditional signals for slow down or go faster or i hafta go pee etc  my experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means slow down  seriously concentrate on being very smooth and you will make her experience much more enjoyable  even a normal upshift causes your passenger to bob so i ease off the throttle before pulling in the clutch to eliminate this  its more work but your passenger will appreciate it  also ive found that using more rear brake than normal helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops which makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on  if youre going sport riding have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves against the tank so you dont have to bear both your weights with your arms  again your bike will dive less too    paul thompson    apple computer

  lottohusc0harvardedu jerry lotto writes  there has been a running thread on the need to understand countersteering  i have seen a lot of opinion but not much of it has any basis in fact or study  the bottom line is  the understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among the accidentinvolved riders in the hurt study  the average rider does not identify that countersteering alone provides the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themselves even after many years of practice  i would agree entirely with these three paragraphs but did the hurt study make any distinction between an ability to swerve and a failure to swerve in most of the accidents and near accidents that ive seen riders will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare simply because the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it overrides everything else hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive manouvres  did hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable

   there was an article in one of the uk dailies this week about a soccer goalkeeper who had to be carried off the field after a collision with a ford sierra cage  seems the cage driver wanted to turn around but needed to drive onto the pitch to do this so he waited till the ball and most of the players were up the other end unfortunately as soon as he started his manouvre someone booted the ball back down the pitch the goalkeeper ran backwards towards his goal straight into the cage

  a few random thoughts on riding with a passenger  theres no substitute for a bike with sufficient power having taken passengers very occasionally on the small 000 etc bikes i used to ride in the uk it was hard  im now riding a gs0000 and thats great even moving from my freinds gsx000 i was riding recently this may be due in part to the fact that neither i nor my regular passengers are particularly slimline   i always tell passengers stay in line with the bike on corners that makes their movements predictable  my regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all i dont really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods again that may be biased by the fact that ive had a couple of new passengers a friend recently for her first time on a bike who hold on to me real tight making any kind of maneuvering difficult  ive also discovered that on longer trips i prefer a passenger who moves and shifts their weight a bit i recently took a work collegue to a meeting about a 0 hour ride and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also sitting very still and getting a sore back  we have a code system for turns stop and for i need to shift position   chris seabrook fujitsu open systems solutions inc  phone 00000000000x000 0000 hollis street emeryville ca 000000000 usa  fax   00000000000                                                     dod    0000              per saltire gules and or a sun counterchanged  
  unable to stand the pain anymore my wife bought the corbin gunfighter and lady with passenger backrest for my hawk gt  it came with no instructions but it came 0 weeks earlier than they said it would  installation would have been very easy but the seat fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with the stock seat  it never was easy to put on  once i figured that out the new seat went on the first try  the passenger backrest though does not fit as i thought it might  the supplied screw to set the  backrest angle does not fit and i have not yet found a suitable  hard  sae grade 0 or perhaps 0  0000 bolt that fits  there is a a soft bolt in there now  just dont lean back  the drivers section of the seat is a bit wider  seems comfortable enough but then again i put about 0000 miles on the stock seat without a thought  the passengers section has about 0 times the  volume of foam that the stock seat has and from my short test it seems much more comfortable  the backrest helps a bit but ive not  has enough time to really test it  the backrest also comes with a  small pocket  its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the  00 taller seat  if i go on the threenotch ride soon  dixville pinkham  smugglers ill give a more complete report but in general it seems like an improvement    frank evan perdicaro xyvision color systems       legalize guns drugs and cashtoday000 edgewater drive    inhouse frankmarvin x0000wakefield ma outhouse frankcontexcom 0000000000x0000000000000

  hi  im not sure what the other guy cant track down his post for his name was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable they are  theres a space between each link where the teeth of the  locking head notch in  thus each link is a possible locking point  also and this is not applicable to hardcore thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxyacetylene torches the cobralinks look a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks imho and i think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to boredjoyridersnominallyadeptat crackingunsecuredbike deterrence as long as the lock is nominally  functional  finally i notice that when i ride with my leathers harness boots and the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier btw ive crashed in the rain dressed like this and the lock didnt pulverize any vertebrae cagers give me a much wider berth dont hassle me and tend to avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights  i love my cobralinks almost as much as i love my pre00s honda dinosaur i think i have a pavlovian drool reflexi put the lock on ie on my body and i can feel the bike already shaking away  my first post  what did i do wrong   sang dod 0000 00 cx000  ps any other cx000 owners out there  please email me got  questions about the weird handling on my bike      the opinions expressed are not necessarily those of the university of      north carolina at chapel hill the campus office for information         technology or the experimental bulletin board service            internet  launchpaduncedu or 00000000

  because riding a passenger doesnt really depend on the type of bike the things you want a passenger to donot do is the same  ergo if hes asking advice i reasoned he doesnt have much practice period  if you say he does fine  i still wouldnt take the uninitiated up a road thats all switch backs and reversecenteruncrowned roadway not to mention the bdcs and squids who will also be on that particular road  he asked for advice and even though it wasnt what he meant i still consider it some of the best ive read   lee

   another good place for your helmet is your mirror  i kid you not if you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors that screw into your handlebars your helmet should fit over your mirror and be fairly stable  be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the mirror  it will depress the foam liner in the helmet  that is not the kind of foam that bounces back like foam rubber  its purpose in life is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin if your mirror compresses it there is that much less energy absorbing capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash  i found the right handlebar to be a good spot if on the sidestand hang with the chinbar facing up balanced across the grip and brake lever such that the weight of the helmet doesnt compress any of the chinbar foam  this is more challanging with an open face helmet   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

   0  all of us that argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand the technique of countersteering  including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner  well all the way through a decreasingradius corner anyway  this is really the only thing we disagree on maybe we should agree to disagree   ok but im right    the official line here though i do have my doubts about it is that the front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place   if thats the official line taught in those rider education classes you were refering to that also dont teach countersteering i have to question the quality of the classes  the official line in msf curricula is as i described  maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it and increasing braking on the front as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift  the official line you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it  applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0 and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0  saying brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless advice to a newbie  he has to go out and slide the tire to find out where that is  it also gives him zero information from which to develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and corresponding weight shift develop  if you dont slide the tyre you have no way of knowing whether youve achieved maximum braking or not im not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can  but if you want to find the limits of the machine you have to go beyond them   not necessarily true  chirping the tire indicates impending lockup on most surfaces and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking  i agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like code used to use  in any case for maximum braking if as i suggested you aim to keep both wheels just on the point of sliding then youll be doing exactly as you suggest  true but from the point of view of how to best teach riding skills which is how this discussion started keep both wheels just on the point of sliding is nearly useless information  you need to teach a technique or at least a strategy to achieve this   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

     various posts about shafties cant do wheelies      no mike  it is imposible due to the shaft effect  the centripital effects    of the rotating shaft counteract any tendency for the front wheel to lift    off the ground    good point johna buddy of mine told me that same thing when i had my  bmw r00gs i dumped the clutch at 0000rpm hey ito nly revved to 0 or so and  you know what he was right    uh folks the shaft doesnt have diddleysquatpoop to do with it i can get  the front wheel off the ground on my 0 ferchrissake  you may have been able to bounce the front up but not actually do a wheelie see the shaft effect unloads the rear susspension and effectivly loads the front this is why a shaft bike should accelerate if it starts scraping in a corner   laz

  ive never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent  experience passengering with dave edmondson at pilot while in london   i found that it upset the bike much less if i rode with the pilot that is if i looked over his shoulder and anticipated when i should hold on hard for braking or acceleration i tried to always look over the inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible leaving dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and  luggage  hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit  off the back is hard to fight similarly i held on to the grab handles tightly when dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp im a lot bigger than he is reaching around him and pushing off the  tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for  him to manage  on the rare occasions when i carry a passenger myself i absolutely refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding thats helmet jacket gloves stout pants and shoesboots as a minimum its  not my responsibility to provide this gear but its my responsibility to require it if they want to ride  and i agree with an earlier poster if youve not had much experience carrying a particular passenger and especially if youve not carried many passengers before take a few gentler rides of some duration before you head off to a difficult road like minesmt hamilton thats a  nasty place to find yourself in trouble  godfrey digiorgi  ramarrenapplecom   dod 0000      ama000000  rule 0 never sell a ducati          the street finds its own  rule 0 always obey rule 0           uses for things wg  ducati cinelli toyota krups nikon sony apple telebit

  my previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something ive weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method slow down to screw up dogs triangulation of target then take off and laugh at the dog now far behind you this time it didnt work because i didnt have time riding up the hill leading to my house i encountered a liverandwhite springer spaniel no relation to the springer softail or the springer spagthorpe a close relation to the spagthorpe viking actually the dog encountered me with intent to harm  but i digress i was riding near the unpainted centerline of the roughly 00foot wide road doing between forty and sixty clicks 00 mph for the velocityimpaired the dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed i later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch about thirty feet away heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road i saw the dog and before you could say sipde he was on me boom i took the dog in the left leg and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike and cracking one panel i think i saw the dog spin around when i looked back but my memory of this moment is hazy  i next turned around and picked the most likely looking house the apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt cut mouth and hoped i was not hurt either i could feel the pain in my shin and expected a cool purple welt to form soon sadly it has not so im left with a tender shin and no cool battle scars  interestingly the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course the not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact delayed pain may have helped me here as i didnt feel a sudden sharp pain that i can remember  what worries me about the accident is this i dont think i could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than i was this is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area but i was riding around the speed limit i worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog but i console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane bdi cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 0000 mph for that matter how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 00 mph by the end  i eagerly await comment  ryan cousinetc0000 yamaha vision xz000 black pig of invernesslive to ride kotrb          0000 ajs 000 cs king rat                      to work to dod 0000      id be a squid if i could afford the bike    flame to ryancousineaucompdynquestororg     vancouver bc canada   live        slmr 00a  hes hurt dammit jim im a doctor  oh right                                                                                           computer dynamics bbs    0000000000hst    0000000000v00 vancouver bc canada   easy access low rates friendly sysop

     i have a question about tires for my guzzi it is a 00 000t the tires that were on it when i just bought it are old and cracked i do not have an owners manual for it yet but the tires listed in the haynes manual are front 000 h 00  rear 000 h 00 and pressures recommended are 00 front and 00 rear oddly the pressure for the same tire on the t0 is listed at 00 psi instead anyone know the reason as i know though the pressure i should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires i purchase  the real question i have is this the old tires that are on the bike are for the front a metzler touring special 000 h 00 and for the rear an avon roadrunner 000 h 00 00000 h 00 as marked on each tire both are larger than that listed in the haynes manual what does the owners manual recommend and was it common to go up one size for this bike also this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities  the above sizes are inches except for the additional mark on the current rear tire what is the best metric match the local bmw dealer thought 00000 h 00 on the front and 00000 h 00 on the back he also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices  i am thinking of going with a metzler me00 laser possibly comp k on the front and me00 on the back both in mbs variety if possible the longer  lasting belting system i already use the me00 on both the vision and fj for the front and like it and i thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the guzzi that the me00 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a me00 might as well as giving much better tire milage life any comments  a friend told me he thought that my bike had boranni rims which are very good but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls i do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time so aside from warning the shop to be careful any other comments i should make i havnt looked at the rim to check out the make yet if it is marked he just told me late yesterday and i havnt had a chance to check the rim type  on another note i will remove the ugly but in good shapeanyone want it vetter fairing and i will run without a windscreen for a while but eventually i would like a simple rounded cafe style quarter fairing for it it could be forkhandlebar mounted any suggestions is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe style for this bike how about lower barsclipons for it i would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe style yes i know to be picky that period really predates this bikeit is just that this bike has such potential for that look  edward walshhewlettpackard company                              edwboihpcom  disk memory division ms000                              0000000000   po box 00  boiseidaho 00000                              00fj000000xz000rjvision00guzzi000tdod00  edward walshhewlettpackard company                              edwboihpcom  disk memory division ms000                              0000000000   po box 00  boiseidaho 00000                              00fj000000xz000rjvision00guzzi000tdod00

  earlier i was reading on the net about using splitfire plugs  one guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell  well i saw one think that someone said about show me a team that used split fires  well heres some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages  splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 0x0 cages  well for these guys splitfires  now i dont know about all of this and im trying to catch up with somebody about it now but splitfires should help twins more than  splitfires work mainly by providing a moreorless unshrouded spark to the combustion chamber if an engines cylinder head design can benefit from this then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase most noticeably in lower rpm range torque splitfires didnt do diddlysquat for my 0000 gmc pickup 00l v0 but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 0000 harley sportster 0000 and my best friends 0000 sportster 000 folks i know whove tried them in 0000 evo motors cant tell any performance boost over plain plugs which is interesting since the xlh and big twin evo combustion chambers are pretty much the same shape just different sizes two of my friends who have shovelhead harleys swear by the splitfires but if i had a shovelhead id dualplug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense plus they look really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head    neal howard   00 xlh0000      dod 000      computrac inc richardson tx       doh 0000000000   000o00      nealcmptrclonestarorg       std disclaimer my opinions are mine not computracs          let us learn to dream gentlemen and then perhaps           we shall learn the truth  august kekule 0000

      request for opinions     which is better  a onepiece aerostitch or a twopiece aerostitch    like most everyone else i ended up getting two different sizes for the top and bottom  my top is a 00l and the bottom is a 00l  for the bottom the waist is far too large but the thighs fit just right the 00 had a better waist but cut off the circulation in my legs i have large muscular thighs and no i didnt use the thighmaster to get them   the jacket fits me ok in the chest slightly snug at the waist and too small in the arms  i cant imagine finding a onepiece size that would have fit correctly as even the 0 piece has its problems strange since my vpilot jacket fits great all over and when i tried the matching pants they fit like a glove as well  i can only assume the models aero design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks  also even though its related to convienience you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands ive gotten some really suspicious looks and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit since you cant fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised except the trunk in my sidecar rig   with the two piece i unzip the pants i generally leave the two pieces zipped together primarily because the pants fall down unless i pull the cheesy elastic belttype band real tight stuff them in one of my spacious bmw saddlebags the pants just fit and run errands just wearing the jacket  actually if i know ill be running errands i just wear my vpilot jacket but thats just me  as far as crash protection id say that both suits are probably equal  it seems that for weather protection if anything the 0 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 0 inches  the 0 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist just because of the extra layer of stuff but maybe not  so id have to vote for the two piece  despite the slightly odd fit i still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing i own  wouldnt go long distance without it  ken wallich wallichncdcom  kenwallichcom  kmwalorg  decwrlvixieamberken  ken wallich wallichncdcom  kenwallichcom  kmwalorg  decwrlvixieamberken

  a few months ago in one the the motorcycle mags there was an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to be available thru bmw  the idea was that the tape would look black in sunlight and reflect in other colors at night to headlights  it sounded like a nice way to add nighttime  visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction  i talked to the local bmw dealer about this  i was told that the  only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector was it being  used in a coming line of bmw clothing rainsuits  he wasnt aware  of anything regarding self applied tape  has anyone come across this from bmw or any other source  thanks   steve bunis  sun microsystems     dod 000000st0000               itasca il  ama 00000000kz000

  any lock including the kyptonite utypes are easy to break into if the person has the proper supplies andor motivation 0 minutes and your bike is gone i would be glad to explain but i dont want to contribute to any unlawful activities especially since i have a bike that i would hate to see ripped off by such a trival tactic warning no lock alone is a safe deterent against theft the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lockpicker to walk away with your property  i personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned  bill

   i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 000 ninja  this will be the the first time ive taken anyone for an extended ride  read farther than around the block    well be riding some twisty   fairly bumpy roads the mines roadmthamilton loop for you sf bay areans    this person is 000 lbs and fairly small so i dont see weight as too much  of a problem but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go  my fiancee and i do quite a bit of sporty riding 0up  ill tell you  what weve found and the systems weve worked out   on starts accelerate much slower than usual  its tough for the rider to judge how scary fast acceleration is because were holding onto something and leaning forward  remember this   on turns have her lean forward and at the same angle as you normally  this means she isnt leaning at all  its very disconcerting to be leaned over and have your passenger leaning so that theyre sitting straight up much balance is lost and this can be dangerous   on slowing and stopping do so much slower than usual  again its tough  for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is because were holding  onto something and leaning forward  however youll figure it out fast because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you which  shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location   generally have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike not  out wide  this helps balance and gives her somegrip   when you passenger is in fear she will squeeze her knees against you normally this means slow down and do it now      turning so she leans with me but what else  are there traditional  signals for slow down or go faster or i hafta go pee etc  we only have a couple signals  slow down is her either tapping me on  the back or slapping my helmet with all her might  depends on the urgency of the matter   turn here is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit  this is also the sign for cool  look at that  i hafta pee is the same sign as turn here  im hungry is the same sign  go faster is usually done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee  i usually see slow down more often than go faster    i really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that  shell want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated  the best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy and  pillion on his or her bike  its incredibly frustrating because youre  in almost no control  now multiply that feeling times ten because you as a rider know what your bike will do and your passenger will likely feel youre about to scrape hard parts all the time or lock up the brakes at any moment or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain etc   pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad  also remember that its much more draining and tiring to ride 0up than by yourself because youre concentrating on much more and in the zen of the moment less  remember this      pat loughery patlomicrosoftcom seattle wa  dod 000 ama vme dioc 0ksi000  00 vfr000f 00 nighthawk 000 00 seca 000 turbo  for sale   
  i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 000 ninja this will be the the first time ive taken anyone for an extended ride read farther than around the block    well be riding some twisty  fairly bumpy roads the mines roadmthamilton loop for you sf bay areans  unless she is really adventurous do not take her on this route for her first extended ride thats kinda like taking someone on a noshow 00way speed star competition as their first skydive  this person is 000 lbs and fairly small so i dont see weight as too much of a problem but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go i want her to hold onto me     rather than the grab rail out back and ive heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction were turning so she leans with me but what else  are there traditional  0 if the ninja has adjustable suspension adjust it to a stiffer setting so you dont bottom out in bumpy curves  0 tell her the 0 cardinal rules are  a never ever ever ever put her feet down not when you stop at a stop sign not when she thinks youre gonna crash never keep them on the pegs until you tell her to get off the bike  b she is to hold onto your waist she should hold on tightly enough that she wont slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit and added bonus for you here she should keep as close to your butt as possible so quick stops dont make her slide into you and knock your balls up onto the gas tank you decide how best to word this  c just stay perpendicular to the bike straight up in the seat dont lean your body into curves just go with the bike and stay perpendicular dont look over your shoulder  0 remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back that means dont pop the clutch and try to corner and stop smoother than usual be aware that if you jump on the brake youre going to have the equivalent of a 000 lb dead weight crashing into you from behind so be prepared for that  0 make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesnt have to go no antiwomen stuff here i have a tiny bladder myself  0 remind her to look around while youre riding point to things of interest it makes the ride more enjoyable to her she wont get so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet and it gives her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at   my wife and i tried the msfrecommended look over the riders shoulder in curves bit and it just didnt work the timing of her weight shift was unpredictable especially on the maxim because unlike the ninja the upright riding position really restricts the pillions view of the road ahead next time i had her just remain perpendicular to the bike and i could hardly tell there was someone else on the bike in curves and she weighs substantially over 000 lbs   curtis jackson   cjacksonmvusadobecom00 hawk gt00 maxim 000 dod0000 kotb  00 black lab mix studley doright  00 colliegolden george there is no justification for taking away individuals freedom  in the guise of public safety  thomas jefferson

  okay doders heres a goddamn mystery for ya   today i was turning a 00 degree corner just like on any other day but there was a slight difference  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible thunk  i pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage  my bike is a kawasaki gpx000r with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a bankfollower or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 000banked turn  the stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 0 mm long which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg  now for the mystery  the stud on the side of the bike that clunked when i turned was absent  im fairly sure it was there before the event  there was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been  in fact the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously    okay all you engineering types how the fk do you explain this   how can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole in alloy without damaging the thread in the hole   is this some sort of hitech design thingo that kawasaki never mentioned like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact to let the stud rip out then changes back to a solid   im quite amazed at how this could have happened  in the meantime life goes on without a lefthand bankfollower  barry manor dod 000 confused accidental pegscraper

   lottohusc0harvardedu jerry lotto writes    the understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among  the accidentinvolved riders in the hurt study    the average rider does not identify that countersteering alone  provides the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themselves  even after many years of practice    i would agree entirely with these three paragraphs but did the hurt  study make any distinction between an ability to swerve and a failure  to swerve in most of the accidents and near accidents that ive seen riders  will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare simply because  the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it overrides  everything else hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive  manouvres  did hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable  apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isnt as strong  as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger  hurt found that a surprising number of accidentinvolved motorcyclists hadnt used their brakes at all prior to impact    i think the only way youll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in  a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you ever use and to practice it constantly even when you have no need to do any turning  if you follow me down a long straight and i seem to be  wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need its because im practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in my path  all of this practice may indeed be futile but if i have even milliseconds to react the most familiar tactic available and hopefully  the most automatic will be countersteering  the same logic applies to braking with the front brake of course  chuck rogers car000torreysattcom

  yesterday a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle dealer it has been a while since he last rode 00 years and i myself have never bought a new bike from a dealer what follows is an experience of that visit and of an observation of squildly behavior by other  customers andor sales personel  background  i ride with a group of friends who mainly are into cruiser type bikes my friend was hell bent on getting an intruder and had seen a few used ones he wanted to see what the new ones were going for so we happened upon a dealer that sold both suzuki and yamaha   the place was fairly busy so we browsed a bit we happened upon a few  intruders most of which had sold signs on my friend had been bitten  well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat i  moseid on outside the next thing i know i see 0 or 0 sport bikes pull in i could stereotype the type of riders backward ball hat oakley iq 00 but i wont well they went inside i didnt think much of it i figured to each his own i went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs firmly implanted into my friends back  when i noticed the hormone gang talking to other salesdroidsmanagers lots of laughter jokes etc no big deal  here is the part that concerned me the hg and those shop personel that were not busy with customers went back out where said hg members fired up their rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 000 beasts at this point one decided to see how much rubber  a katana 000 could deposit in the drive  squids i thought to myself but i was appalled that the salesdroidsmanager not only condoned this behavior but encourged it to the point were they were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour the girl that was riding pillion on another bike seemed rather hormonal about this display and urged her pilot to quickly catch up the others followed making sure there kerkers could be heard as well as felt  i felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist i felt the eyes of those in cages witnessing this display then glancing over to the dealers lot and damning all those on two wheels needless to say my friend felt a little uncomfortable and we left   i will now turn off my frustration and go ride peacefully to clear my anger i only hope that the cop who is following me home has an open mind and doesnt associate me with them   btw i cant afford a new bike

  hello folks  im very happy with my new r00gs  my range is 000 miles on 00 gallons thats 00 mpg  surprisingly the bike is a real cruiser  i was expecting something rough   shes a sweet backroad honey  and i can go pretty much anyplace id take my mountain bike  as far as shaft effect its more a  torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion  rev it sitting still when the driveshaft is not moving and the bike twists a bit  maybe  if the clutch is in then a large chunk of counterrotating mass is not rotating  hence at a light reving makes it twist  shaft effect is the rear end rising under power or the real problem getting lower to the road when the throttle is snapped shut say when you are cornering and the heads are real close to the road  new gs bikes with the paralever shaft have almost no shaft effect  i dont ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect but in my opinion a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence  okay here are  my questions  0 any recommendations for a homemade fairing  id like to keep the wind off my chest and perhaps my helmet for comfort at highway speeds 00 mph yet dont want to a screw up the stability or b block my vision too much for trail riding  anybody have luck with twopiece  detachible fairings  id like to make it myself out of plexiglas  0 i run two lights the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the crash bar  the illuminations excellent that way with a full beam coming out from the level of the motor left side the lamp beam is linear so that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right and it  really picks up the periphery deer lurking etc  combined with the  headlamp on high you can see like day  but ive heard that bmw alternators dont crank out too much  do i need to shut down the sidelamp when im puttering around in the dirt at low rpm    its a question of how long you spend at low rpm and how much you need the extra light  at low rpm 0k and under they dont charge all that much if at all  the alternators put out sufficient wattage it just that you need to be at 0k rpm to get it    0 this is embarassing im having trouble starting the bike first thing in the morning  i invariably flood the carbs then go in and read a section of the paper and then she starts right up  is this a zen thing   full choke  open the gas taps  hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the throttle  it should fire  cranking should be done with minimal throttle my r000 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle  its an experience thing  like zen its hard to describe  it can be hard to learn if you arent paying atttention to the differences between success and failure  especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the battery while trying to get it to run  if my bike has been sitting for a few weeks i give it a short while to start  if it doesnt i turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to vaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off  ive got dual plugs which make it easier to start  0 the haynes manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline with alcohol additives yeah right  what do you folks due to keep the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol  any  particular brands of gas that are best  additives  the big fix is the bing carb upgrade kit  its good for a few mpg and the parts are alcohol proof  the parts it replaces arent alcohol proof  as long as the bike isnt going to sit for long periods of time gasohol is nice since it helps keep ping away  if your bike doesnt ping on cheap gas you ought to raise the compression half a smiley the bmw twins of the 00s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the epa happy  dual plugs and higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance  neil kirby      dod 0000       nakarchiecbusaattcom att bell labs  columbus oh     usa 000 0000000 if you think i speak for att you might have more lawyers than sense

  warning warning may cause unpleasantness   i was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in milford nh with an assortment of other nedod folks when dean cookson  yes he has not left the  country yet mentioned that the wiring diagram of the vfr000  shows that  the light switch is a three position switch   high beam low beam both beams   well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a 0 position switch but sure enough as deam expected  when you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high and low beams go on  this provides a very nice light coverage of the road  this is true for the st00 and the vfr000 and i would expect for any  other late model honda with the standard two position light switch   its a make before break type of switch  if not required it ought to be for highlow beams    there might be a wee problem with this  if you use both filaments at the same time the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal possibly enough to shorten its life span  my honda crx cage a cage that really wanted to be a bike had wimpy stock lights  so we used to run around with both beams on  made a mucho big difference  until both low beam filaments died nearly simultaneously  this was two weeks after finding out how nice it was to use both beams  i replaced the lights with quartzhalogen lights and that ended the problem  neil kirby      dod 0000       nakarchiecbusaattcom att bell labs  columbus oh     usa 000 0000000 if you think i speak for att you might have more lawyers than sense

   my first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run a big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes i was riding with and tried  to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me he kicked the dog a  couple of times we were all only going about 0000mph and just made the dog angrier and got away by applying wfo and outrunning the dog who then started after yours truly at the time i had open drag pipes obnoxiously loud as hell and as soon as the dog was about 0 feet away from the right side of my bike i pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 0000rpm and the roar of the pipes frightened the dog away probably made the dogs ears hurt like hell and he didnt come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either   my second encounter was with an already deceased roadkill dog i wasnt paying  very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the carcass i looked down just in time to see what i was about to run over so i  just held onto the handlebars and freaked out both wheels went squarely over the dogs belly with a thumpthump just like running over a piece of a 0x0 lumber the bike didnt lose any stability at all and i kept on going after i got to my destination i found bits of fur meat and blood stuck to the bottom of my motor and frame gross    neal howard   00 xlh0000      dod 000      computrac inc richardson tx       doh 0000000000   000o00      nealcmptrclonestarorg       std disclaimer my opinions are mine not computracs          let us learn to dream gentlemen and then perhaps           we shall learn the truth  august kekule 0000

   another good place for your helmet is your mirror  i kid you not if you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors that screw into your handlebars your helmet should fit over your mirror and be fairly stable   butt butt then yu w0nt be able t0 ee the car neakg up behind yu and p0p a whhheeeeelllleeeee t0 dtchum and the chick dig it  seriously though putting a helmet on a mirror is inadvisable because you are then resting the weight of the helmet on the fragile foam liner that is expected to cushion your noggin  and once crushed that foam never pops back  a variation of mirror hanging thing is what i do with the bike on the sidestand hey the centerstand is for maintenance i turn the wheel to the stop left and can hang the helmet by the chinbar on the right grip  there is no crushable foam in the chinbar and it is pretty secure on there as long as the forks are locked  if i have to leave the helmet with the parked bike and the bags arent onfull that is about the most stable place  dave svoboda svobodavoidrtsgmotcom     im getting tired of 00 concours 0000 mmmmmmmmmm                beating you up dave 00 rz 000 ring ding woops                you never learn ama 000000  dod 0000  cog 000  chicago      beth bruiser dixon

  after failing my state of new hampshire noise gestapo test with my hd slash cut pipes i installed my new bubs which i had been planning to do anyway went to a different in spection station and passed with no problem at about 00 db  two points  first i dont think the first dude did the noise test correctly  holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading and doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced the db level so if any other nh riders need to get this done make sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from the body  second these bub pipes are bloody terrific at low revs or cruising through town they as quiet as the stock pipes but have a sound thats a more throaty purring rumble  when you open her up to 0000 rpm they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar best of both worlds  russ hughes  00 fxstc  dod 000000e00 the chrome and steel she ridescollidin with the very air she breathes                n young

          quite right your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain  most of their charge if drained and dried well but id throw out the  electrolyte and buy some more when you need it           and before anyone says im wrong remember that new batteries almost  always come ready charged and dry and they are perfectly ok even after  several years storage at the shop    mark fox     makes sense to me after all when steel is manufactured and stored they put oil on it so it wont rust logicaly when you store your bike you must strip the paint and put oil on the metal to prevent rus

  quick question  what are the advantages of slipons versus your stock exhaust versus aftermarket exhaust systems i dont see many people using slipons but they are heavily advertised and half as expensive  thanks dave   cost is lower than oem replacements and they weigh less also in most  instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more  performance i replaced my oem canister with an ontario systems slip on the midrange performance is better but i also notice a slight stumble at  00k rpm after talking to kaz yoshima the developer and manufacturer of  the slip on he thinks i might need larger pilot idle jets was not suppose to but maybe where i live makes a difference altitude barometric pressure anyway besides that minor glitch i like the slip on performance and the sound which is louder than stock but not loud enough to annoy folks the ontario  slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full  throttle  just remember every bike is a tuned system when you change the intake or exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer you may have to change other areas to compensate like a complete change of the exhaust system header and muffler changes the exhaust characteristic to the point which rejetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathingpumping profile  talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if they have used it on your particular bike check with people who have the system also to see what they think about there slip on  also as a last data point in sport riders first issue did a review on a group of header and exhaust systems for the cbr000f0 they also included as a  side bar the ontario slip on the dyno showed an increase from stock of 0bhp at the rear wheel 00 verses 00   buyer beware of outrageous claimed increases in horse power it may have been  true in the past but not today  at                                                                                                                                         00                                            0000 cbr000f0             allen tobias           technical    email                   convex computer corp  marketing    tobiasconvexcom        0000 waterview parkway                                         richardson tx 00000                                                  this bike is awesome and im fearless lets gojay gleason   
  it sure would be nice if someone would start making replacements for oem exhausts that were would be cheaper but not louder  i read about a supertrapp system called ear that was supposed to be quiet enough to pass some european standards  apparently its not on the market yet  yoshimura makes a few systems that are supposed to be kind of quiet they are also really light  im planning on getting one of these  systems soon and will post the results   mark  mark s burnham markbwcnovellcom ama000000  dod0000  alfa romeo gtv0                             00 ninja 000   
   i saw this posted and it brings an interesting event to mind     the reactions of little boys seems to be the most enthusiastic to a wave and also good to see  i always wave when i see a kid that has at least noticed my bike  i figure it helps the future of the sport  i have to admit that i usually try to do so without the parental figure noticing  im afraid that the kid will get yelled at for associatign with antisocietal types like us   a few weeks ago i was in the dmv with ken i was standing in a mile long  line waiting for some really bored looking person to fleece a bunch of  people from some dough ken was sitting on a chair next to our helmets  wondering why everybody there looked to be about the social calibur of  people you would find at a laundromat when some young woman walked in who  required our conferring attentions he came over and stood in line with me  while we watched her fill out some forms and then we noticed a little kid  about 0 years old reach over the bench and touch our helmets one at a time  i didnt particularly mind and neither did ken that the kid was touching  our helmets that is but the helmets werent on the most stable of  platforms so ken scooted over there to resettle them and as soon as he  touched the helmets mother of said child started shrieking at her kid you  stay away from those you shit and whopped the tyke brutally about the head  and shoulders  i suppose it was our scary sex drugs and unix tshirts that sent such  bouts of terror through her body

is as simple as asking the keeper of the list kotl accept no substitue keepers for a number if youre feeling creative and your favorite number hasnt been taken already you can make a request subject to kotl approval warning nonnumeric non base00 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the kotl not that you wont get it but you will pay for it  oh and just one little tiny suggestion ask the kotl in email youll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net and youll look like a clueless newbie too  by now youre probably asking so whos the kotl already well as john sloan notes below thats about the only real secret left around here but a few unsubtle hints can be divulged first it is not myself nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting maybe  though john was the original kotl second in keeping with the true spirit of unix the kotls first name is only two letters long and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters 00 the kotl shares his name with a line oriented text utility third he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new dod numbers mostly to boneheads with weenie mailers fourth there is reason to suspect the kotl of being a deadhead   newsflash a message from the kotl   once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the kotl please keep in mind that the kotl does indeed work for a living and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done  your request may languish in mailer queue for gasp days perhaps even horrors a week or two  during such times of economic activity on the part of the kotls employers sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue it just makes it longer verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader  if you suspect mailer problems at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted lest you be assigned multiple numbers what you think the kotl memorizes the list    one more thing the kotl says that its telepathic powers arent what they used to be so provide some information for the list will ya the typical dod list entry contains number name statecountry  email address for example  0000ed greencaedgreeneastsuncom  ps while john mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for dod membership

of  course nickerson the originator of the parodies was given dod nr 0000  the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules  appealed to many so john sloan  dod nr 0000  became keeper of the  list issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one  to date there have been  almost 000 memberships issued to people all over the united states and  canada as well as australia new zealand the united kingdom france  germany norway and finland  keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch  the initial run  of 000 patches sold out immediately  the profits from this went to the  american motorcycle heritage foundation  another amhf fund raiser   selling denizens of doom pins to members  was started by arnie skurow a  few months later  again the project was successful and the profits were  donated to the foundation  so far the denizens have contributed over 0000  to the ama museum  a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs  in the motorcycle heritage museum  as often as possible the doders crawl out from behind their crts and go  riding together  it turns out that the two largest concentrations of  doders are centered near denverboulder colorado and in californias  silicon valley  consequently two major events are the annual assault on  rollins pass in colorado and the northern versus southern california  joust  the rideandfeed is a bike trip over rollins pass followed by a big  barbecue dinner  the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern  california ride south riders from southern california to ride north  meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle  an additional plan  for 0000 is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction  with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus ohio in july  though its a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective  communications hub recmotorcycles will not replace the more traditional  motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in  search of twowheeled camaraderie its a great way for kindred spirits to  get together  long may they flame   live to flame  flame to livecenterbar  this official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which  you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do  anything like that face to face  these insults are known as flames   issuing them is called flaming  flames often start when a member  disagrees with something another member has posted over the network  a  typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reasoned rebuttal would be  something like  what an incredibly stupid statement you spandexclad  poseur  this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense  of the original poster describing just what they think of you your riding  ability and your cat              the denizens of doom the saga unfolds                    by john sloan  dod 0000  periodically the question what is dod is raised this is one of those questions in the same class as why is the sky blue if there is a god why is there so much suffering in the world and why do women inevitably tell you that youre such a nice guy just before they dump you the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism tradition and philosophy questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms motorcycle service bays and in the halls of academe for generations   a long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem on a computer far far away on the net topologically speaking two machines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in chicago a chap who wished to remain anonymous but who was eventually assigned the dod membership 0 wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of recmotorcycles and signed it the denizen of doom not wishing to identify himself he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become dod 0 to post it for him dod 0 not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual did so  flaming and other amusements followed   he who would become the holder of dod membership 0 thought this was the funniest thing hed seen in a while being the sort that is pretty easily amused so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom motorcycle club and started signing his postings with his membership number   perhaps readers of recmotorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues no rules no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organized electronically  it may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a gestalt personality something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts  it could also be that were all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members   in a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy the denizens of doom motorcycle club was born a club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face and perhaps like it that way yet feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup a club organized and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail with a membershipmailing list often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating around the country organized by dod 0 club patches organized by 00 and even an mtvstyle music video produced by 00 and distributed on vhs by 00   where will it end who knows will the dod start sanctioning races placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the onboard engine management computers will the dod organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 000sized unix system only time will tell   the dod has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles to become a member one need only ask although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets new members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list which includes name state and email address   the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live forever or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name                     live to flame  flame to live         the dod daemon as seen on the patches pins etc by

systems analyst  cowtowing to the whims of a machine and saying yessir nosir  mayihaveanothersir  my mother made me do it  i wanted  to live a mans life music slowly builds in background  riding nortons and triumphs through the highest mountain passes  and the deepest valleys  living the life of a motorcyclist  doing donuts and evading the police  terrorizing old ladies and raping small children  eating small dogs for tea and large dogs for dinner  in short  i want to be      a denizen  chuck rips off his lab coat revealing black leather jacket with fringe boots and cap  scene

you have to be killed  well the first thing you have to understand just in case you managed to read this far and still not figure it out is that the dod started as a joke and in the words of one denizen it intends to remain one  sometime in the far distant past a hapless newbie asked what does dod stand for its not the department of defense is it naturally a denizen who had watched the movie top gun a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied  thats classified we could tell you but then wed have to kill you  and the rest is history  a variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about what dod stands for notable contributions and contributers where known include  daughters of democracy dod 00doers of donuts dancers of despair dod 0debasers of daughters

dictionary file                         the recmotophoto archive  first a bit of history this all started with ilana stern and chuck rogers organizing a recmotorcycles photo album many copies were made and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in unknown locations then bruce tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp  email access but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive  not only can you see what all these folks look like you can also gawk at their motorcycles a few nonphoto files are available from the server too they include the dod membership list the dod yellow pages the general recmotorcycles faq and this faq posting  here are a couple of excerpts from from messages bruce posted about how to use the archive    via ftp  cerritosedu 00000000000  via email  the address is servercerritosedu  the commands are given in the body of the message  the current commands are dir and send given one per line  the arguments to the commands are vms style file specifications  for recmotophoto the file spec is dodfile  for example you can send  dir dod send dodbrucetannergif send doddodframeps  and youll get back 0 mail messages a directory listing 0 uuencoded parts of brucetannergif and the dodframeps file in ascii  oh wildcards  are allowed but a maximum of 00 mail messages rounded up to the next whole file are send  a send dodgif would send 000 files of 00k each not a good idea   bruce

a note if you find the recmotophoto archive useful second since bruce has provided the server as a favor it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours california time                           patches what patches  you may have heard mention of various dod trinkets such as patches  pins and your reaction was probably i want or thats sick or perhaps thats sick i want  well theres some good news and some bad news the good news is that theres been an amazing variety of dodlabeled widgets created the bad news is that there isnt anywhere you can buy any of them this isnt because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no dod store that keeps a stock all of the creations have been done by individual denizens out of their own pockets the typical procedure is someone says im thinking of having a dod frammitz made theyll cost xxxx with xxxx going to the ama museum anyone want one then orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the prepaid orders is produced and quickly consumed so if you want a dod doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all this is anarchy in action  heres a possibly incomplete list of known dod merchandise and perpetrators patches dod00 pins dod00 stickers dod00 motorcycle license plate frames dod000 tshirts dod00 polo

  i was wondering if anybody knows anything about a yamaha seca turbo  im  considering buying a used 0000 seca turbo for 0000 canadian 0000 us with 00000 km on the odo  this will be my first bike  any comments  thanks  peter how institute of space and atmospheric studies university of saskatchewan saskatoon saskatchewan canada 000 0000000 inhowskisasusaskca                        0000 clappedout ford truck                      
      one thing is certain though its still too cold  after about 00  minutes i had to stop and hold my muffler for a while    be very careful about this if youre really cold the muffler will feel fine till you leave all the charred skin on it when you peel your hands off  i speak from experience you can also do all  kindsa americanism of the day damage to your circulation warming  hands up on something too hot by far the best fastest and safest way to do it is to shove the hands up the opposit sleeves and stand there like a ming emporer for a while five minutes should  do it  
  first ride of the season  one thing is certain though its still too cold  after about 00 minutes i had to stop and hold my muffler for a while  when i got home after a few hours i kept all my gear on for about a half hour in the house  00f 000 humidity no wind protection and 00mph do not mix well   hell this is warm i retired my fleece from under the aerostich last  month when the temperature got aboce 00 try living a couple of years  on the dole so you cant afford any heating you put the gear on in october abd you take it off again in may getting out on the bike  seems like a luxury in comparison cos oyur usuallu going somewhere  warm   its all relative   happy cold riding   who are you trying to kid  its the pain that makes it all worthwhile  
  every spec of alertness to keep from getting squished otherwise its not only dangerous its unpleasant the same goes for cold and fatigue as i once took a half hour nap at a gas station to insure that i would make it  yeah hypothermia is much more detrimemtal to your judgement and reactions than people realise i wish i had the patience to stop when i should one day ill pay for it  if you  begin to shiver  stop and warm up thoroughly if you leave it till the shivering stops this doesnt mean youre ok again it means  youre a danger to yourself and everyone else on the road  your brain and body are working about as fast as a tree grows you will not realise this yourself till you hit something the next stage is passing out  this usually means falling off  
   so you cant ride the bike but you will drive truck home the judgement and motor skills needed to pilot a moto are not required in a cage this scares the sht out of me    this is a piece of psychology its essential for any long term biker to understand people do not think if i do this will someone else suffer they assess things purely on if i do this will i suffer  this is a vital concept in bikecage interaction

     grf dropped my shoei rf000 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock  it onto its centerstand chipped the heck out of the paint on it    so i cheerfully spent 00 on a bottle of testors model paint and  repainted the scratches and chips for 00 minutes    then while it was drying i realized that i was out of smokes and that my  cage is not currently running so i had to take my bike down to the  store not wanting to mess up my paint job i said well heck i can just  use my old helmet this is your standard el cheapie openface      i didnt notice a big difference when i switched to the shoei but  switching back was really bad     0 doesnt fit worth a damn too wide in the sides too short front to  back  0 with a faceplate its still bloody windy with the shoei i normally  ignore the face shield until i get up to about 00ish with this one  taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind          the question for the day is re passenger helmets if you dont know for  certain whos gonna ride with you like say you meet them at a  church  meeting yeah thats the ticket what are some guidelines should i just  pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet xl or should i  maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely  passenger

       watch out  often when some scumbag steals the cover that means    that they were or are looking to steal the bike  in my case i    had a faded cover stolen off a bmw r000rs that was stashed in an    apartment carport and not visible from the street  they evidently    decided the beemer wasnt worth stealing but did try the next night to    steal a honda hurricane 000 parked in the next apartment building    a neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops   i know this is just setting myself up but this is actually one of the things that is really good about bmw bikes  from all accounts ive heard practically no one steals bmws probably it is similar for moto guzzis and other relative exotics since there isnt a large demand for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down it seems that the most stolen bikes are harleys and 000cc jap sport bikes    jonathan e polito     internet jpolitoencorecom encore computer corp 000 kildaire farm rd cary nc  00000  usa 0000000000voice  0000000000fax

  i just mailed this  i noticed a 00in long cut in the tread of the rear tire on my vfr the cut is only about as deep as the tread block and looks like it only scratched the rubber at the base but the weird thing is its way over on the edge where i havent scuffed the tire in yet my questions are 0 how dangerous is this should i replace the tire right away and 0 if i should since the cut is on the unscuffed portion and the tire only has about 000 mi on it what do you think my chances of getting it replaced under warranty are  to the nedod mailing list and jack tavares suggested i check out how old the tire is as one tactic for getting it replaced  does anyone have the file on how to read the date codes handy  thanks dean     dean cookson  dcooksonmitreorg  000 0000000     dod 000  ama 000000   the mitre corp burlington rd bedford ma 00000   kotnml    kotb         the road is my shepherd and i shall not stop       00 vfr000f             sam eliott road hogs mtv 0000                      00 bianchi limited

  i cant think of another subject that generates as much contradictory advice as traffic laws and their enforcement  everybodys got an opinion and is dead certain they are right  yet acurate information is extremely difficult to come by  the dmv doesnt know  cops dont know  your traffic school instructor doesnt know  the vehicle code only tells part of the story  judges choose to interpret the laws in a wide variety of ways  and the public at large  i seldom hear any advice that doesnt disagree with something ive experienced  if you dont believe me i suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code study it and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really happens  read fight your ticket too but dont miss the little section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and youre basically screwed  as you may have guessed im pretty down on the system here in california  ive carefully prepared for court bringing witnesses and revealing serious holes in the officers story only to be slapped with the maximum allowable fine plus assessments of over 000  the message clear that the judge does not appreciate john q public trying his own cases  so heres my advice when you find yourself with a ticket  take traffic school if you can  if its a serious matter get a lawyer  a lawyer can present the exact same case as you the difference is the sentence   paul thompson    apple computer

   if we are only talking about 0stroke i think i can understand exhaust pulse affect in a 0stroke the intake valve is closed on the exhaust stroke and the gas is pushed out by the cyclinder  i guess there is some gas compression that may affect the amount pushed out but the limiting factor seems to be the header pipe and not the  canister  meaning would gases so far down the line the canister really have an effect on the exhaust stroke  do the gases really  compress that much      for discussion purposes i will ignore dynamic effects like pulses in the exhaust pipe and try to paint a useful mental picture  0  unless an engine is supercharged the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is atmospheric  at the time the intake valve is opened the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure left over after the exhaust stroke and atmospheric  as the piston decends on the intake stroke combustion chamber pressure is decreased allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract  at no time does the pressure ever become negative or even approach a good vacuum  0  at the time of the exhaust valve closing the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction the muffler  note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion  0  in the last 00 years the japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning in pursuit of almighty horsepower  at this point in time on highperformance bikes substitution of an aftermarket freeflow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance because the stock intake system flows very well anyway  substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference unless in general the new exhaust system is much louder than the stocker  0  on older bikes  exhaust backpressure was the dominating factor if freeflowing air filters were substituted very little difference was noted unless a freeflowing exhaust system was installed as well  0  in general an engine can be visualized as an air pump  at any given rpm anything that will cause the engine to pump more air be it on the intake or exhaust side will cause it to produce more horsepower pumping more air will require recalibration rejetting of the carburetor    dave tharp                       dod 0000    you cant wear out         davetinterceptorcdstekcom    mra 000       an indian scout          00 k00s  00 indian chief       ahrma 000    or its brother the chief  00 r00s000 00 tr0b000   ama 000000   theyre built like rocks   00 r000velorex  00 nsu max                  to take the knocks             0000 bmw r00               compulsive  its the harleys that       my employer has no idea           joiner      give you grief           
  personally i follow the no alcohol rule when im on a bike  my view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike  if i get hurt its my own fault but i dont want to wreck my katana  i developed this philosophy from an impromptu experiment  i had one beer at 000 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 000  i wasnt even close to leagle intoxication but i couldnt perform even the most basic things until 000  this made     me think about how i viewed alcohol and intoxication  you may seem fine but your reactions may be affected such that youll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind  i greatly enjoy social drinking but for me it just doesnt mix with riding  max enjoyment eric   
    thanks to all of you who gave advice on the cb000 custom   as recommended i had the bike compression tested  compression was a little low but very even across the four cylinders  0 psi  they said that it was tested a little cold so that would explain the low  numbers around 00  does this sound right  otherwise the bike looked great  no signs of road rash and no rust  this bike looks great  it is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires   i am opting for the metzler me00 and me00 tires thanks to those  who posted this other thread  this bike is big compared to my other bikes    sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the kdx000 was   i should be road legal tomorrow  i am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about  the transmission and taking my chances  being a reletively new reader i am quite impressed with all the usefull info available on this newsgroup  i would ask how to get my own dod number but ill probably be too busy riding                                                                                                                                jamie w burnside                                     oo     jburnsidellmitedu                                  c                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
   insurance companies sure seem to go for nofault coverage  since the majority of accidents are the cagers fault doesnt this imply that we would have to pay much higher rates under a nofault system  with a carsonly system it seems to make sense on the surface take the legal costs out of the system  but it looks like motorcyclists would get screwed     michael chuck bain                       meb0000icdfscaboeingcom         semiloud pipes save lives

  in heavy traffic i slow down a bit mostly so i have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind but i also often find that the  jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes switch into one of them and pass me  which is fine because then i can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind while looking ahead rather than from in front while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors  this is pretty damned complicated i just make a back off motion with my handarm and the second or third time even the most braindead cager backs off if they dont back off then i find a way to get the hell out of there  the cager is either psychotic drunk or just a complete asshole in any case i dont want to be anywhere near and especially not in front   curtis jackson   cjacksonmvusadobecom00 hawk gt00 maxim 000 dod0000 kotb  00 black lab mix studley doright  00 colliegolden george there is no justification for taking away individuals freedom  in the guise of public safety  thomas jefferson

  for those of you who are thinking about fiamms you might also want to think about airhorns i just installed a set of bosch air horns ordered from  dennis kirk pg 000 of the latest catalog on my 00 fj0000 they are rated at 00db at 0 meters i installed them using 00 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground my stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine i soldered the connections to the relay and compressor and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 00amp fuseconnector from napa i installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing you have to remove the front fairing to do this but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses depending how tight your fairing follows the frame you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing the compressor is about 0 in diameter and about 0 long the relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it i found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount the horns fit inside the front fairingframe and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops but behind the turn signals the back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame there is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into the short horn is even with the fairing and the long one sticks out about an inch or so but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely they end up pointing down slightly and maybe 00 degrees from straight ahead perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you if you have any other questions about the mounting email and i can try to explain better if your bike is not red then you may want to paint them first how do they work you ask they are very very very loud they sound more like a european sports car than a truck but a vast improvement over stock i have used them at least daily since installing them and the 00 amp fuse has not blown yet although the duration of the horn blasts have been short ive repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them even though they know that i have the horns they still jump they are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk the bottom line is they work are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages as well as take a few years off their lives and are relatively easy to install on the fj ymmv  tjk 00 fj0000 with get out of my way horns that looks like a suit youd fight a fire in comment about the aerostich

   we all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle the question is is one of the effect dominant and which one is it the idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar  as you point out the experiments would be difficult but we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations there are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn  0 gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over  0 contact patch having shifted to one side causing bike to fall over  0 contact patch being accelerated to the side causing a torque which twists the bike over  take an average bikerider average bike wheel and at speeds of 0 00 and 00 mph say calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce say 00 degrees of lean in say 0 seconds by each effect alone my guess is that at slow speeds 0 is dominant and at high speeds 0 is dominant and at all speeds 0 contributes not far off bugger all relatively speaking  by the way a similar problem is this how does a runner who wants to run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast is there a running group where we could start counterfooting arguments and have them all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners   chris malcolm    camukacedaifh          00 000 000 0000 department of artificial intelligence    edinburgh university 0 forrest hill edinburgh eh0 0ql uk                dod 000

  im a biker and a doglover  first and foremost i want to mention some common sense  if its a choice between injuringkilling a dog or getting yourself injuredkilled there is only one rational decision  only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first  second its useful to learn how to read a dogs body language  how you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks its a game and that youre playing with him is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent  third its useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog  dogs are social beasts and recognize a dominationsubmission hierarchy  to a dog there are two types of fellowcreatures that which he dominates and that which dominate him  you need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class  you are god you are easily angered and your anger is terrible but god is also amused by one who properly submits to his dominance and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word a kind word or even oh joy oh rapture unforeseen a dog bisquit  now how does that all relate to biking  well first its a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think its a game and not out of overt hostility  the msf suggestion is a very good one when you see the dog coming slow down so he determines a particular place of interception  just before you and he reach that spot punch the throttle so that when he reaches it youre already long gone  dogs take a few seconds to react to new input and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of  with a hostile dog or one which you repeatedly encounter stronger measures may be necessary  this is the face off  first  and there is very important  make sure you never face off a dog on his territory  face him off on the road not on his driveway  if necessary have a large stick rolled up newspaper etc something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him  stand your ground then slowly advance  your mental attitude is that you are very angry and are going to dispense terrible punishment  the larger the dog the greater your anger  dogs will pick up anger just as they can pick up fear  and since you and he are not on his home territory it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory and that you are prepared to fight to the death  most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage  theyll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat gesture of submission and thus they have escaped punishment  the interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great deal to them  the more effective you are at communicating body language the less you actually have to do  after 0 years with my 00 pound beast ive learned a few tricks i think

   insurance companies sure seem to go for nofault coverage  since the majority of accidents are the cagers fault doesnt this imply that we would have to pay much higher rates under a nofault system  with a carsonly system it seems to make sense on the surface take the legal costs out of the system  but it looks like motorcyclists would get screwed  yup  unfortunately as has been pointed out the cost of insurance does not go down with no fault  the crappiest drivers make out like bandits because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy drivers  the good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of the crappy drivers actions and thats not fair  any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of shit because the rest of us end up paying more  any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are inherently less safe than slower drivers and the nhtsa disproved that two years ago now  later   chris behannadod 000          0000 hd fxwg wide glide  jubilees red lady behannasylnjneccom          0000 cb000t  baby bike disclaimer  now why would nec  0000 zx00  needs a name agree with any of this anyway    i was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs

   yo whaz up  earlier i was reading on the net about using splitfire plugs  one guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell  well i saw one think that someone said about show me a team that used split fires  well heres some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages  splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 0x0 cages  well for these guys splitfires increased performance by increasing torque  they werent focusing on horsepower numbers  now how does this related to us high performance pilots  well that depends  do you pilot a high performance 0 or 0cylinder machine in the case of 0cylinders splitfires would increase overall torque but 0s make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low so for 0s splitfires would not significantly increase power  but what about twins  many of you 0 guys laugh at some of us twins but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss see doug polen vs scott russell daytona 0000  however twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands   so how does this translate  increased torque should theoretically help twins make more power  splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made just stick em in  now i dont know about all of this and im trying to catch up with somebody about it now but splitfires should help twins more than 0s          as far as racing teams  ducati team fast by ferraci used splitfires in the 0000 season this is when they had jamie james running for em but i dont know why they stopped since then also somebody check to see if they had them in 00  peace  warren wcd00000uxacsouiucedu have suzuki will travel  at a local fixeruper shop the bike repairest looked at a dumped zx0  then he asked the guy  what happened   i dumped the clutch how fast        pretty fast insurance       nope  the fixer smiled  what do you know about bikes   not much

  so it looks like im going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage for a few months starting several months from now and im already contemplating how to do it so theyre as easy to get going again as possible i have everything under control i think besides the batteries i know that if i buy a 0000 battery tender for each one and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage theyll be fine but im not sure thats necessary ive never heard anyone discussing this idea so maybe theres some reason why it isnt so great but maybe someone can tell me  would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries drain the electrolyte into separate containers one for each battery seal the container close up the batteries and leave them that way then it would seem that when the bikes come out of storage i could put the electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully charged whats wrong with this  on a related but different note for you bay area denizens wasnt there someone who had a bunch of spare edta a few months back who was it is there still any of it left  thanks for any and all help   robert

  leavittcsumdedu mr bill writes  mjssysueaacuk mike sixsmith writes mjsalso imho telling newbies about countersteering is er counterproductive mjscos it just confuses them i rode around quite happily for 00 years  mjsknowing nothing about countersteering i cannot say i ride any differently mjsnow that i know about it  i interpret this to mean that youre representative of every other motorcyclist in the world eh mike  rather presumptive of you  imho  in my humble opinion  leavittcsumdedu mr bill writes leavittthe time to learn countersteering techniques is when you are first leavittstarting to learn before you develop any bad habits  i rode for leavittfive years before taking my first course msf erc and learning leavittabout how to countersteer  its now eight years later and i still leavitthave to consciously tell myself dont steer countersteer  old leavitthabits die hard and bad habits even harder  mjssorry bill but this is complete bollocks you learned how to countersteer  mjsthe first time you rode the bike its natural and intuitive   sorry mike im not going to kick over the can you not countersteer over 0mph stone  that ones been kicked around enough  for the sake of argument ill concede that its countersteering sake of argument only  mjsmsf did not teach you how to countersteer it only told you what mjsyou were already doing  and theres no value in that    i didnt say there was no value  all i said was that it is very confusing to newbies    theres a big difference in 0 knowing whats happening and how to make it do it especially in the extreme case of an emergency swerve and 0 just letting the bike do whatever it does to make itself turn  once i knew precisely what was happening and how to make it do it abruptly and on command my emergency avoidance abilities improved tenfold not to mention a big improvement in my normal cornering ability  i am much more proficient knowing how to countersteer the motorcycle rather than letting the motorcycle steer itself  that is when i remember to take cognitive command of the bike rather than letting it run itself through the corners  whereupon i return to my original comment  better to learn whats happening right from the start and how to take charge of it rather than developing the bad habit of merely going along for the ride  bill you are kidding yourself here firstly motorcycles do not steer themselves  only the rider can do that secondly it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the  motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles and not the knowledge of physics between the riders ears are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competently than you could manage otherwise   mike im extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total waste of time for you assuming your total training hasnt come from simply from reading recmotorcycles  however 00 of the motorcyclists ive discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience as overwhelmingly positive  this regardless of the amount of experience they brought into the course ranging from 00 minutes to 00 years  formal training in this country as far as i am aware does not include countersteering theory  i found out about countersteering about six years ago from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist i didnt believe him at first when he said i steered my bike to the right to make it turn left but i went out and analysed closely what i was doing and realized he was  right its an interesting bit of knowledge and ive had a lot of fun since then telling others about it who were at first as sceptical as i was but thats all it is  an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster or better as a result is absurd  formal training is in my view absolutely essential if youre going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely but by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn and that was my original point  mike

     after both oil changes the oil level was at the top mark in the window on the lower right side of the motor but ive been noticing that the oil level seen in the window gradually decreases over the miles  im always checking the window with the bike on level ground and after it has sat idle for awhile so the oil has a chance to drain back into the pan  the bike isnt leaking oil any place and i dont see any smoke coming out of the exhaust    my owners manual says the amount of oil corresponding to the high and low marks in the oil level window is approx 0 quart  it looks like my bike has been using about 00 quarts0000 miles  the owners manual also gives a figure for max oil consumption of about 00ozmile or 00l000km    my question is whether the degree of oil consumption im seeing on my bike is normal  have any other k00 owners seen their oil level gradually and consistently go down  should i take the bike in for work  im asking local guys also to get as many data points as i can     its normal for the bmw k bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand  miles  i dont know why  ive had three new k bikes and all three used a bit of oil when new  max maybe 0 quart in first 0000 miles this soon quits and by the time i had 00000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero ive been told that the harder you run the bike within reason the sooner it stops using any oil   charlie smith   charlieelektrocmhnetorg  kotdohl  kotwitdodl  0kspi0000   dod 0000   doh 0000000000    ama moa ra buckey beemers bk ohio v               bmw k0000lt  r00gspd  r00  triumph tr0                            columbus ohio usa

   okay doders heres a goddamn mystery for ya       the stud on the side of the bike that clunked when i turned was absent  im  fairly sure it was there before the event  in fact the thread in  the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact with no evidence of something  having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously      okay all you engineering types how the fk do you explain this   how can you  rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole in alloy without  damaging the thread in the hole     you cant knock a threaded stud out from its hole without destroying  the threads  also part of the stud would still be in the hole  therefore the stud was not in the hole before you touched something  down on that side of the bike dr doom   
  egreeneastsuncom ed green  pixel cruncher writes  in article 000000000zensysueaacuk mjssysueaacuk mike sixsmith writes egreeneastsuncom ed green  pixel cruncher writes   0  all of us that argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand the technique of countersteering  including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner  the underlying physics are a different matter and need not be taught to beginners   agreed  countersteering the technique should be taught for only with understanding of the technique can one develop maximally effective emergency avoidance manuvers  this is really the only thing we disagree on maybe we should agree to disagree i still think  that telling newbies to steer left to turn to the right is unnecessarily confusing when theyll do it anyway if they just get on the bike and ride the damn thing   0 i know exactly whats happening  its those other gits that havent a clue     me too     understanding the physics of traction is fine  but i cannot see how detailed theory like that has any place in a motorcyle training course all you need to know is that maximum traction is obtained with the tyre just beginning to slide against the road  then we are in violent disagreement  while what you state is true it is insufficient to form a traction management policy  available traction increases with applied normal force ie traction available to the front wheel increases as weight shifts under braking forces and correspondingly decreases at the rear  thus a technique of applying both brakes and easing off the rear and increasing pressure on the front can best be learned with an understanding of weight shift and available traction  jeez ed when you started talking about traction management policies i thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway locomotives  the official line here though i do have my doubts about it is that the front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place in practice i suspect most people do what you describe  saying brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless advice to a newbie  he has to go out and slide the tire to find out where that is  it also gives him zero information from which to develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and corresponding weight shift develop  if you dont slide the tyre you have no way of knowing whether youve achieved maximum braking or not im not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can  but if you want to find the limits of the machine you have to go beyond them   in any case for maximum braking if as i suggested you aim to keep both wheels just on the point of sliding then youll be doing exactly as you suggest      
  0  what is buying a bike going to do to my insurance  i turn 00 in  about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now and i need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a  motorcycle is going to insure i live in washington dc if that makes a difference  it depends on the bike once youve found a bike youre interested in call some insurance companies for rates some bikes are much cheaper to insure than you might think my ex000 only costs me 000year in st louis im 00  0  any recommendations on what i should buywhere i should look for it  for a first bike i recommend 000ccs or less and a bike short enough to get both feet on the ground when you stop   the one piece of advice everyone will give you is to take a motorcycle safety foundation riders course see a dealer for details in some states completion of such a course can give you a break on insurance it will also teach you to ride properly from the beginning so you wont learn any bad habits  good luck riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have naked or otherwise  alan

  several years ago while driving a cage a dog darted out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance between us so i didnt have to slow down however a 0nd dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that scottish terrier  apparently it was following the 0st dog henceforth if a dog decides to cross the street keep an eye out for a 0nd dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs   ive yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black gl0000i which has a pretty loud oem horn not as good as fiamms but good enuff but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards id def feel more vulnerable on my 00 trump as thatd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels  if theres a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to the owner i wouldnt be adverse to running over it with my truck as a dogs life isnt worth much imho compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the ground by said dog and dies from a head injury   any dog in the neighborhood thats vicious or a public menace running about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate  graeme harrison gharrisohpcc00corphpcom dod000

     formal training is in my view absolutely essential if youre going to  be able to ride a bike properly and safely but by including countersteering  theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at  the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn  and that was my original point    mike  while i agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding i disagree strongly with your original point the point of formal training  must be to prepare riders for the road preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible so to exclude some aspects of riding a bike  in a course is wrong imho now to countersteering in particular countersteering is something that must be trained a common reaction among  new bikers or bicycle riders in an emergency situation is to steer the  motorcycle like a bicycle as we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended needless to say this is dangerous i have a specific example a rider in a left turn the rider thinks heshe is to close to the right shoulder of the road and tries to steer the  motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right  handle the motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road  a worse scenario the same rider same turn in the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards himher the panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it  the main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency  situations and what to do if in one thus the knowledge and training of countersteering is imho a must in any riding course   staalidtunitno

  hello everyone  im new to motorcycles so no flames please  i dont have my bike yet so i need a few pieces of information    any stories on how you all learned  ill tell you my story as an example of what not to do  early in 0000 i took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old honda cb000t  he had taken the msf beginners course so i actually learned some of what i needed to know to ride  i proceeded to buy a beatup honda cl000 for 000 and a 00 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker  then i decided to invest in a fullface helmet first smart move  sometime around then i also passed my road test  on may 0 0000 i got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 0mile trip  entering the town where i lived a rather urban suburb i had to stop suddenly for a red light that i noticed too late skidded the rear tire out and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic  fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light otherwise i might have slid under a car and been killed  now this is anecdotal evidence to be sure but i later took the experienced rider course from the msf and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly  in your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as i did  so my advice is to take the msf beginners course first thing  i wouldnt even buy a bike until youve taken the course unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until youre ready to use it  0  i only have about 00000000 to work with so that would have  to cover everything bike helmet anything else that im too  ignorant to know i need to buy  while youre waiting to take the course it might take a few weeks in dc as i recall there were always waiting lists in boston could you save up some more money to start out right  say 000 for riding gear plus the cost bike plus maybe 000 guess to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe assuming you economize by buying some old beatup machine from a private individual plus insurance plus registration and licensing fees plus the course youre looking at maybe 000 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance  0  what is buying a bike going to do to my insurance  i turn 00 in  about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now and i need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a  motorcycle is going to insure i live in washington dc if that makes a difference  i pay about 000 insurance now upstate ny but it was closer to 000 in boston more urban for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability which you want unless you plan always to be poor  id guess dc is more like boston than like a rural area ergo more expensive  0  any recommendations on what i should buywhere i should look for it  there used to be annual buyers guides in the usual motorcycle magazines i found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available  you could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available  my first bike was 00 years old when i bought it so i went on my friends advice instead  also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street  i basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of highmileage bmws running around and they were generally set up the way i wanted  nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms  dealers in the boston area at least when i was shopping were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that werent the latest models hence cheaper although i ended up buying both bikes in private sales   david karr karrcscornelledu  00 bmw r00   dod 0000   also bmwmoa nra aclu et al

  i was posting to altlocksmithing about the best methods for securing  a motorcycle  i got several responses referring to the cobra lock described below  has anyone come across a store carrying this lock in the chicago area  it is available through some dealerships who in turn have to back order it from the manufacturer directly  each one is made to order at least if you get a nonstandard length standard is 0 i believe  any other feedback from someone who has used this  see below  in article 0r0000innrajshelleyuwashingtonedu basijisteinuwashingtonedu david basiji writes    incidentally the best lock ive found for bikes is the cobra lock  its a cable which is shrouded by an articulated hardened steel sleeve  the lock itself is cylindrical and the locking pawl engages the joints  at the articulation points so the chain can be adjusted like handcuffs  you cant get any leverage on the lock to break it open and the cylinder  is wellprotected  i wouldnt want to cut one of these without a torch  andor a vice and heavy duty cutting wheel  i have a 0 long cobralinks lock that i used to use for my harley she doesnt get out much anymore so i dont use the lock that often anymore  it is made of 00 articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable it is probably enough to stop all the joyriders but unfortunately professionals can open it rather easily  0 freeze a link  0 break frozen link with your favorite method hammers work well  0 snip through the steel cables which i have on authority are frightfully thin with a set of boltcutters  for the same money you can get a kryptonite cable lock which is anywhere from 00 to 00 thick steel cable looks like steel rope shielded in a flexible covering to protect your bikes finish and has a barreltype locking mechanism  i dont know if its adjustable but my source says its more difficult to pick than most locks and the cable tends to squish flat in boltcutter jaws rather than shear 00 model  all bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute  fyi ill be getting a krypto cable next paycheck  later   chris behannadod 000          0000 hd fxwg wide glide  jubilees red lady behannasylnjneccom          0000 cb000t  baby bike disclaimer  now why would nec  0000 zx00  needs a name agree with any of this anyway    i was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs

      having talked to a couple people about helmets  dropping im getting  about 00 dont sweat it 00 you might think about replacing it and the  other 0 dont ride with it go without a helmet first    is there any way to tell if a helmet is damaged structurally i dropped it  about 0 00 feet to cement off my seat chipped the paint didnt seem to  screw up the actual shell   id bet the price of the helmet that its okayfrom 0 feet or higher maybe not   if i dont end up replacing it in the real near future would i do better  to wear my totally nondamaged 00 face dotrated cheapie which doesnt fit  as well or keep out the wind as well or wearing the shoei rf000 which is a  lot more comfortable keeps the wind out better is quieter but might  have some minor damage  id wear the full facer but then id be way more worried about wind blast in the face and inability to hear police sirens than the helmet being a little damaged    also what would you all reccomend as far as good helmets im slightly  disappointed by how badly the shoei has scratched  etc from not being  bloody careful about it and how little impact it took to chip the paint  and arguably mess it up period looking at a really good fullface with  good venting  wind protection i like the shoei style kinda like the  norton one i saw awhile back too but suspect im going to have to get a  much more expensive helmet if i want to not replace it every time im not  being careful where i set it down  well my next helmet will be subject to it fitting well an agv sukhoi thats just because i like the looks my current one is a shoei task0 and its getting a little old and i crashed in it once a couple of years ago no hard impact to headmy hip took care of that if price was a consideration id get a kiwi k00 i hear they are both good and cheap   christ i dont treat my head as carefully as i treated the shoei as far as  tossing it down and i dont have any bruises on it   be mildly mildly paranoid about the helmet but dont get carried away there are people on the net like those 0 you mentioned that do not consistently live on our planet  regards charles dod0000 rz000   within the span of the last few weeks i have heard elements of separate threads which in that they have been conjoined in time struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing gourd unknown netperson  
  in article mjs000000000zensysueaacuk mjssysueaacuk mike sixsmith writes  no no no no all i am saying is that you dont even need to tell people the  technique of countersteering cos they will do it intuitively the first time they try to go round a corner  some will and others will steer with their tuchuses i dont know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers i was one i guess that i always steered a bicycle that way and i only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding after the course i could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem but i only started using it in my normal riding when i decided that my turning at speed offramps and the like was a lot more difficult that it should have been i knew how it works although thats currently up for debate definitely knew that it works as i could do it in swerves but only figured it out later in my normal riding just a data point i think that its not a bad idea to bring the idea up but its best to let everyone tuchussteer for the first lesson or two so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique  countersteering  in fact my experienced rider course instructors claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike turn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight around even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite direction  i admit ive never actually seen this  i have in our beginner course we had passenger training sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike and the student would take him for a ride if the student did not give the instructor the you are a sack of potatoes passenger speech the instructor would steer the bike and make a general nuisance of himself it was amusing to watch im just happy that it didnt happen to me  ive        bike                      like        jody levine  dod 000 kv      got a       you can        if you      pf   jodyplevinehydroonca                          ride it                  toronto ontario canada  
   on the other side of the fence i owned a bieffe offroad helmet took what i would consider a minor fall and had visible damage to the shell  yes the helmet did its job  but the damageimpact ratio was scary  i own bell moto0 now have taken impacts on order of twice the bieffe impact we do this frequently in mx and dont even have a scratch on it after two seasons  my recommendation is to buy high quality gear  ymmv  when your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object there are only four things to dissipate the energy the immoveable object the helmet shell the helmet liner the riders head the riders ego ok five assuming that the helmet head assembly takes the same impact if the shell cracks in one case then in the other the liner must be dented or the head gets jiggled if its the the liner thats dented the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were cracked it wont absorb energy form an impact in that area if its the head thats getting jiggled maybe the new gear isnt of as high quality after all  ive        bike                      like        jody levine  dod 000 kv      got a       you can        if you      pf   jodyplevinehydroonca                          ride it                  toronto ontario canada

   on 00 apr 00 000000 gmt xlyxvax0citcornelledu said   is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive   yes but the rear wheel comes off the ground not the front  see it just hops into the air  figure john stafford     sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike i had a bmw r000rs that was a wheelie monster of course it didnt have the initial power burst to just twist it into the air  i had to pop the clutch i also had to replace front fork seals a few times as well the fairing is a  bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the time but let me give you fair warning i trashed the ringpinion gear in the final drive of my k00 i assume doing wheelies and this was  no cheap fix either there is some kind of slip device in the shaft to prevent it from breaking unfortunately it didnt save the gears    on the topic of wheelies the other day i saw a kid on a big hurricane do a stoppy or rear wheelie man he had the rear end on this bike  up about 0 feet off the ground at a traffic light i dont recommend these activities anymore now that im an old guy with kids of my own but it looked damn impressive    if you cant keep both tires on the ground at least have em pointed in that direction   cheers  b0

  dsfrom vikingiastateedu dan sorenson  dsryancousineaucompdynquestororg ryan cousineau  writes  dsriding up the hill leading to my dshouse i encountered a liverandwhite springer spaniel no relation to dsthe springer softail or the springer spagthorpe a close relation to dsthe spagthorpe viking  ds        i must have missed the article on the spagthorpe viking  was dsthat the one with the little illuminated dragons head on the front dsfender a style later copied by indian and the round side covers  no not at all the viking was a trick little unit made way back when forties fifties when spag was trying to make a go of it in racing the first iteration the springer was a boxer twin very similar to max frizs famous design but with an overhead point cam see below for more on the valvetrain the problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever the solution was to curve the cylinder bores so that the ground clearance was substantially increased            springer motor front                  viking motor front      this is roughly the idea except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius as the pistons were loath to make a sharpangled turn in the middle of their stroke the engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke  the engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary and still unique overhead cam system through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves  just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the waterwheel which kept the lobe spinning over one side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engines oil pressure came up to normal the engines valve timing would be more or less random resulting in some impressive startup valve damage the solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast remarkably similar to the system used in new porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started the cage however uses an electric oil pump wimps  despite this fix the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner the solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly this was feasible because it was a racing engine  with just a single overhead lobe and no pushrodshaftchain towers because of the hydraulic system the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point                                             lobe                    xx   complex linkage not shown due to  valvestems            complexity                                                                0  piston                                                    note that the tip was not truly vertical                              it was at about a 00 degree angle to the                              ground and this drawing doesnt show the                              curvature because there was none in the                              head itself the bore curve would start                              about where the cylinder bore disappears in                              this diagram   the effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently pundits of the day even said sensuously curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank thus the name  the vik was a moderately successful racer lightning fast when it worked but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology eventually it was dumped when spag finally realized that racing was not where the spagthorpe name would be made the machines were raced for another year or two by privateers and their fate approximately six vikings were made plus one or possibly two springers confusing the issue is one old spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line however no modern record of a production viking has survived and most motorcycle historians discount this story  ryan cousinetc0000 yamaha vision xz000 black pig of invernesslive to ride kotrb          0000 ajs 000 cs king rat                      to work to dod 0000      id be a squid if i could afford the bike    flame to ryancousineaucompdynquestororg     vancouver bc canada   live        slmr 00a  if you arent sliding you arent riding                                                                                                              computer dynamics bbs    0000000000hst    0000000000v00 vancouver bc canada   easy access low rates friendly sysop   
  for the same money you can get a kryptonite cable lock which is anywhere from 00 to 00 thick steel cable looks like steel rope shielded in a flexible covering to protect your bikes finish and has a barreltype locking mechanism  i dont know if its adjustable but my source says its more difficult to pick than most locks and the cable tends to squish flat in boltcutter jaws rather than shear 00 model  fyi ill be getting a krypto cable next paycheck  a word of warning though  kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the kryptonite name  when i obtained my second motorcycle i migrated one of my kryptonite  ulocks from my bicycle to the new bike  i then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle  for about the same money 00 i had the choice of a kryptonite cable lock advantages lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both kryptonite name or a cheesy noname ulock advantages real steel i chose the kryptonite cable  after less than a week i took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy noname ulock  first the krypto cable i bought is not made by kryptonite is not covered by the kryptonite guarantee and doesnt even approach kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance  it is just some generic madeintaiwan cable lock with the kryptonite name on it  secondly the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke  i dont know if mine was a particularly poor example but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage and sometimes it would seem to engage only to fall open when i went to unlock it  thirdly the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the  dark  i didnt try it obviously but i have my doubts that the  lock mechanism would stand up to an insert screwdriver and torque attack  fourthly the cable was not in my opinion of sufficient thickness to  deter theft for my piece of crap bicycle that is  all cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time  if you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers  aviation snips would go  through the cable in well under a minute           michael robinson                          uucp   ucbvaxcogscirobinson                                         internet robinsoncogsciberkeleyedu

   hey ed how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horses reins left to go left    or am i confusing two threads here  three actually  i believe i discussed countersteering a horse before  basically there are two ways to steer a horse plowrein and neckrein  plowreining steers him by keeping the reins separate and you pull in the direction you wish to go  neckreining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand and pulling against the horses neck in the direction you wish to go  when training a plowsteering horse to neckrein one technique is to cross the reins under his necks  thus when neckreining to the left the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit which the horse is used to from his plowreining days  are you sorry you asked yet   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

       request for opinions     which is better  a onepiece aerostitch or a twopiece aerostitch      were looking for more than well the 0pc is more versatile but the     0pc is better protection     thanks in advance    nadine   what is best books have been written on that but in regard to aerostich it really depends on your particular size shape and needs if you upper and lower body are not proportional according to aero dimensions then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching the 0 piece suit i have the 0 piece suit and i am very happy with it having my life quota of scars from crashing off road i am very concerned with good protection and i believe that the difference in protection between the 0 and 0 piece suits is almost negligible i think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference one thing that is nice about the 0 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while still with jacket you can just detach and stow the pants   one thing to note is that goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women with standard suits supposedly for smaller women and petite men for that matter the 0 piece will fit better   another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them i wish i got 00 inches added to my pant legs i find the long suits are not really that long i cant imagine how short the standard suits must be    jonathan e polito     internet jpolitoencorecom encore computer corp 000 kildaire farm rd cary nc  00000  usa 0000000000voice  0000000000fax

   i can file a complaint about this and actually have the chance to have something done how who where  a traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime thats why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you want one you are still innocent until proven guilty  cops are not the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes anyone who witnesses a crime can do so  go to the highway patrol and explain the situation give them a description of the car and the license number and tell them the specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute ie search the vehicle code and have the section number handy  fill out the ticket and sign it  it will go through the same system any ticket a cop writes goes through  if contested you will have to appear in court to prosecute  your word will not carry the same weight as a cops   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

   i was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my stock harley pipes make enough noise to draw someones attention  sure there are horns but my hand is already on the throttle should we get into how many feet a bike going 00mph goes in 00 seconds or how long it would take me to push my horn button  if we do i think youd loose  sure youre hands already on the throttle  and your thumb is already near the horn button  pushing the horn button is one simple move  revving the throttle requires either engaging the clutch or accelerating  the first is a more complex manuver than a simple horn button push and the second aint too bright when there is a potential hazard ahead  besides the unique sound of a horn is more effective in attracting the attention of bdi cagers than is the sound of an engine which is what they expect to hear you are on the road  as is usually the case a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound safety procedure  the answer is 00000 feet   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

   secondly it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the  motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles and not the knowledge of physics between the riders ears are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competently than you could manage otherwise  if hes not i will  put two riders on identical machines  its the one who knows what hes doing and why that will be faster  it may be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is through trial and error but it is not very effective methodology only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique i hold that this applies to any human endeavor  thats all it is  an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster or better as a result is absurd  do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction  braking  it is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques  for most of his riding life this may not be a problem but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage  but by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn  i disagree  the existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing nor detracts from any other aspects of the course  and that was my original point  perhaps but in the ensuing discussion you strayed far from that point to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a riders ability  i find this assertion ludicrous   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

   so the question i have is how dangerous is riding              tough question  more dangerous than driving a car and far more dangerous if you dont apply a modicum of intelligence to the  activity  basically stupidity will get you hurtkilled a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car  but with care it is not unreasonably dangerous  also buying good protective clothing is helpful that way if something does go wrong you are likely to be less severely injured  first thing if possible take a msf driver training course this will get you started on the right foot  they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices  second buy protective gear  at minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must  a good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful though leather hiking boots a pair of old army boots or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied  after those a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well but these are also expensive items  for the pants many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight  similarly for a jacket a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants  another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a secondhand leather jacket  look for a fairly thick leather in these items  third dont do anything stupid  dont ride after  drinking even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance dont ride in the snow or when conditions are such that black ice is likely be very careful riding in the rain  slow way down take corners gingerly  brake early and gently  try not to ride if you are sick tired taking any medication with drowsiness warnings or otherwise not in average shape  with care you should be ok  the next question i have is what bike would you recommend for a first time rider i dont want to race nor do i want to ride cross country nor do i want to ride on dirt trails ill probably drive it on back roads with occasional rides on city streets and freeways the maximum i can spend is about 0000 so ill be looking at a used bike  i would suggest mid to late 00s japanese midsized standard something in 000000 cc range would probably be reasonable  if you are shorterlighter than average you might want to go as low as a 000000 cc bike  possible models  the suzuki gs series eg gs000 gs000 etc  these are generally inline 0 bikes generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system  stator andor regulatorrectifier  problems  my first bike was a about 00 gs000 it server me well  the honda nighthawk series this may also be known as the cb series i think  eg honda cb000 cb000 etc  this is another series of standard motorcycles  also fairly dependable  kawasaki and yamaha probably have similar bikes but i dont know them as well  for mid to late 00s models of the above you should be able to buy the bike for under 0000 leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs  hope this helps david dagibbsqnxcom

  sixteen days i had put off test driving the honda st0000  finally the 00th was a saturday without much rain  in fact it cleared up  became warm and sunny and the wind died  about three weeks ago i took a long cool ride on the hawk down to cycles 000 for a test ride they had sold and delivered the demo st0000 about fifteen hours before i arrived  and the demo vfr was bikelocked in the showroom  surrounded by 000 other bikes and not likely to move soon  today was different  there were even more bikes  00 used dirt bikes 00 used street bikes 00 cars and a big tent full of outlandishly fat touring bikes with trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot some sort of fat bike convention  shelly and dave were running one msf course each at the same time  one in the classroom and one on the back lot  plus there was the usuall free cookout food that cycles gives away every weekend in the summer  hmmm it seemed like a big moto party  after about ten minutes of looking for rob c cheif of sales slime and another 0 minutes reading and signing a long disclosurelibility praytogod form i helped jt push the st out into the mess in the parking lot  we went over the the controls i put the tank bag from  the hawk into the right saddlebag and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag   thats nice   having helped push the  st out to the lot i thought it best to have jt move it to the edge of the road away from the 000 bikes and 000 people  he rode it like a bicycle  it cant be that heavy i thought  well i was wrong  as i sat on the st both feet down all i could  think was big  then i put one foot up  heavy came to mind very quickly  with cindy on the back  was she on the back  hard to  tell with seat three times as large as a hawk seat  the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road  by 0000 rpm in second gear all the weight seemed to dissappear  even on bike with 00 miles on the odometer slippery new tires and pads that  did not yet bite the disks things seems smooth and sure  cycles is on a section of 000 that few folks ever ride  about 00 miles north of the computer concentration about five miles north of where i00 splits away 000 is a lighly travelled two lane limited access highway  it goes through heavily forested sections of hamilton  manchesterbythesea and newbury on its way to gloucester on its way there it meets 000 a road that winds from the sea about 00 miles inland to andover  on its way it goes through many thoroughly new england spots  perfect if slow sport touring sections  cindy has no difficulty with speed  0rd gear 0th gear purring along in top gear  this thing has less low rpm grunt that my hawk  lane  changes were a new experience  a big heft is required to move this  thing  responds well though   no wallowing or complaint  behind the fairing it was fairly quiet but the helmet buffeting was nontrivial  top gear car passing at 00mph was nearly effortless smooth smooth smooth   not sure what the v0 sound reminds me of but it is pleasant  if only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz  the jump on to 000 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes  its a down hill reversing camber twicereversing radius decreasing radius turn  a real squeeze is needed on the front binder   the section of 000 we were on was tight but too urban  the st works ok in this section but it shows its weight  we went by the clam shack oft featured in spencer for hire  a place where you could really  find spencer his house was about 00 miles down 000  after putting through traffic for a while we turned and went back to 000  about half way through the onramp i yanked cindys wrist our singal for hold on tight  head check left  time to find redline  second gear gives a good shove  third too  fourth sees dod speed with a  short shift into top  on the way to 000 we saw no cops and very light traffic  did not cross into dod zone because the bike was too new well now it had 00 miles on it so it was ok  tried some high effort lane changes some wide sweeping turns  time to wick it up  i went  until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat  and stayed there  when i was comfortable with the wind and the steering  i looked down to find an indicated 000mph  not bad for 0up touring  beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit  at the get off in a mile sign i rolled off the throttle and coasted  i wanted to readjust to the coming slowness  it was a good idea  there were several manholesized patches of sand on the exit ramp  back to the  slow and heavy behavior  cycles is about a mile from 000  i could  see even more cars stacked up outside right when i got off  i managed to thread the st through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front  heavy  it took way too much effort for cindy and i to put the thing on the center stand  i am sure that if i used the side stand the st would have been on its side within a minute   my demo opinion  heavy  put it on a diet  smooth comfortable hardly notices the dod speed   id buy on for about 0000 less than  list just like it is  too much  for the bike as it is    frank evan perdicaro xyvision

  gs0000e  its a great bike but youd better be damn careful   i got a 0000 as my third motorcycle  deleta the bike is light for its size i think its 000 pounds but heavy for a beginner bike  heavy for a beginner bike it is 000 pounds it isnt except maybe in some admans dream  with a full tank its in the area of 000 lbs depending on year etc  youre 00  you should have no problem physically managing it  the seat is roughly akin to a plasticcoated 0by0  very firm to very painful depending upon time in the saddle  the 0000 and 00 versions had a much better seat imo  the bike suffers from the infamous suzuki regulator problem  i have so far avoided forking out the roughly 000 for the suzuki part by kludging in different honda regulatorrectifier units from junkyards  the charging system consistently overcharges the battery  i have to refill it nearly weekly this in itself is not so bad but battery access is gained only after removing the seat the tank and the airbox  my regulator lasted over 000000 miles and didnt overcharge the battery the wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though tending to melt their insulation  i suspect they were underspecified it didnt help that they were well removed from cool air  battery access on the earlier bikes doesnt require tank removal after you learn the drill its pretty straightforward   replacement parts like all suzuki parts are outrageously expensive  having bought replacement parts for several brands of motorcycles ill offer a grain of salt to be taken with dales assessment   good luck and be careful dale  sentiments i cant argue withor wont  dean deeds deedsvulcan0edsghaccom

   this person is 000 lbs and fairly small so i dont see weight as too much of a problem but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go i want her to hold onto me     rather than the grab rail out back and ive heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction were turning so she leans with me but what else  are there traditional signals for slow down or go faster or i hafta go pee etc  ive never liked my passengers to try and shift their weight with the turns at all i find the weight shift can be very sudden and unnerving its one thing if theyre just getting comfortable or decide to look over your other shoulder but i dont recommend having himher shift her weight with each turn too violent  also i think someone already said this make sure your passenger wears good gear i sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or lacking other safety gear depends on how squidly i feel but i wont let passengers do it what i do to myself i can handle but i wouldnt want to hurt anyone else so i dont let them on without gloves jacket at least jeans heavy boots and a helmet that fits  i really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that shell want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated  go real easy its amazing how solid a grip you have on the handle bars that your passenger does not dont make her feel like shes going to slide off the back and snappy turns for you are sickening lurches for her in general it feels much less controlled and smooth as a passenger i cant stand being on the back of my brothers bike and i ride aggressively when i ride and i know hes a good pilot still everything feels very unsteady when youre a passenger    thanks         bob  show off by not showing off the first time out   this is where i wanna sit and buy you a drink someday  temple of the dog seabass sears  scs0cunixbcccolumbiaedu  dod000  stanley id  00 yamaha xs000f  00 bmw r000s  00 toyota 0runner      nyc ny

  one point not yet mentioned hands on the drivers shoulders are a definite nono  it feels good for the passenger to stretch her arms and a shoulder massage feels good too but the shoulders are connected to the arms and the arms to the handlebars  should you hit the brakes the pressure on the shoulders can make steering interesting  bundle her up if its cold make sure she has good gear say it again an pat her thigh to let her know all is great  good luckmike

  since at least one other person was interested in this  my fzrs black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired yesterday i bought a can of vht 0000 degree black header paint and spent an hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand  sprayed on paint  thought about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that i wouldnt be at all suprised if the paint worechipped off in a month  soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder coating while extremely durable will not handle over 000 degree temperatures  the place i talked to said they were experimenting with some new powder that is supposed to handle 0000 degrees but that it wouldnt be available for months at least  they directed me to another shop that specializes in header coating  the other shop said they have 0 coatings available  one is aluminized that can do 0000 degrees and is comparable to powder coating for durability the other is silicon i think based and can do 0000 degrees  but is thinner and not as durable  both coatings have a textured finish not super smooth and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush  price for 0 0foot header pipes and a 0foot 000 collector was 000  im planning to take the parts up friday and get them back ups next week maybe wednesday  sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint considering how much abuse the pipes get from road craprocks  axel

  mjssysueaacuk mike sixsmith writes mjsno no no no all i am saying is that you dont even need to tell people mjsthe technique of countersteering cos they will do it intuitively the first mjstime they try to go round a corner  karrcscornelledu david karr writes karrare you sure  remember that you can get around corners without karrcountersteering  in fact my experienced rider course instructors karrclaimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike karrturn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight karraround even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite karrdirection  i admit ive never actually seen this  ive experienced this back when i was younger and more foolish  my first bike used to track extremely true  going down the highway i would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas steady slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest riding without any hands  if i needed to turn id shift my weight into the turn and lo and behold the bike would turn sans touching the bars granted it wouldnt turn very fast but it proves that you can turn a bike without countersteering at least not in terms of the input to the bar normally associated with countersteering  as ive said i know many people who think all you do is lean and any input theyre giving to the bar is totally unconscious  whereas that may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances possibly for years at a stretch i cant think of anybody whod argue that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar in a turn regardless of what you want to call it  except maybe for mr sixsmith    mr bill    bill leavitt 000    00 cbx white lightning 00 gs000g suzibago     leavittcsumdedu  00 cj000 little honda 00 lone star sick leave    dod ama icoa nia   00 impala convertible the incredible hulk others   hmmm i thought bore and stroke was the technique michael bain 000   
  hola amigos  quiero i need an answer to a pressing question  i now own two bikes and would love to keep them both  one is a capable and smooth street bike low and lightweight with wide power and great brakes the other is a beemer gs kind of rough for the city but great on the long road and backroad  a good start at a stable but i dont think its going to work  unfortunately insurance is going to pluck me by the short hairs    unless some insurance agent offers a multivehicle discount  they do this all the time for cars assuming that youre only capable of  driving one of the things at a time  i dont think ill ever manage to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street turn left accelerate the zephyr turn right accelerate the beemer  does anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to discount your rates  state farm doesnt  by the way im moving to the bay area so ill be insuring the bikes there and registering them  to ease me of the shock can somebody guesstimate the cost of insuring a zr000 and a r000gs  here in tucson they only cost me 000 full and 000 liability only for the two per annum  muchas gracias enrique  
     i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 000 ninja    this will be the the first time ive taken anyone for an extended ride    read farther than around the block    well be riding some twisty     fairly bumpy roads the mines roadmthamilton loop for you sf bay areans  communication  work out your own system  or just slow down and holler back every once in a while  at reasonable speeds even on my undermuffled magna we can hear each other  its only above say 00 mph that you  cant really communicate  balance new passengers are a real pain because you never know how theyre going to react to steering  some people catch on immediately and lean with me  others are completely skittish about the leaning thing and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon  this is a pain while turning but manageable  the worst are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon then remember in the middle of a turn and whip around until theyre in the correct position  this always screws up the line ive picked out  heres my personal checklist of things to tell passengers  attire helmet long pants bootsheavy shoes jacket  keep feet on pegs at all times unless i say otherwise  do not   get onoff unless i say you can  ive had people try to dismount   in traffic just as im pulling in to a parking space  muffler gets hot nuff said  we get good traction  were not going to fall over  many   firsttime riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn  turn dynamics  sit so that you feel like youre sitting upright and   were going straight  trust your butt not your eyes  if youre   confused close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel   of it  or just hug me tight    please no sudden moves  shift your weight as desired but be    gradual so i can compensate  your faceplate is yours to openclose as desired  trust is essential  trust the driver me to do the right    thing  ive driven many miles on this thing and know how   to operate it  enjoy the ride  this is important to   stress  for example one of my firsttime passwngers seemed to    watch the speedo like a hawk  i drove her to the beach down 00    and whever we topped 00 mph shed holler slow down im scared    i humored her for a while then simply covered the speedometer with    the spare piece of duct tape i keep stuck to the top of the cluster   problem solved  she watched the scenery instead of the   instruments and had a much better time  based on her   experience driving a lincoln continental she was unwilling to    trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike  usually ill point out the controls engine transmission brakes  tires etc and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for firsttimers helps calm their nerves and gives the bike a chance to warm up  watch out for gravel on the mt hamilton road  there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain by now many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little round nearly invisible stones it doesnt help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner on the  first trip  good luck  have fun  dont drink soap dilute dilute ok

   yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar to countersteering  basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to occur to the left  this sounds suspiciously like black magic to me  if by quick wiggle to the right you mean that the handlebars turn toward the right before turning to the left what is the input to the steering mechanism that makes this happen in the absence of the old shoveshove   david karr karrcscornelledu  00 bmw r00   dod 0000   also bmwmoa nra aclu et al

  to followup i had a bad experience w a krypto lock too  last year i bought a krypto cable ii 00x00 long something like that that by all standards seemed like a decent piece  until i used it anyway     so in short the 00 cables seems to be pretty useless i would guess    the larger cable seems to be a much better unit    ive got the larger cable  about 00 inch in diameter actually i think its larger about 0 feet long which coils into a 0 or 0 inch coil with the tubular key lock like the ulocks  it has worked fine for me for two years now and seems to me anyway that it is very secure  it doesnt have the weaknesses that the ulocks have other than the liquid nitrogen trick supposedly is much easier to store in my tankbag than a ulock and more versatile  i got mine from one of the mailorder houses motorcycle accessory warehouse i beleive for 00    in combination with an ignition disable and a couple of other deterrents all i usually worry about is vandalism  randy davis                            email randymegatekcom zx00 00000 pilot                            uunetucsdmegatekrandy dod 0000         but this one goes to eleven  nigel tufnel spinal tap

   i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 000 ninja  this will be the the first time ive taken anyone for an extended ride  read farther than around the block    well be riding some twisty   fairly bumpy roads the mines roadmthamilton loop for you sf bay areans     an extended ride as a passenger on a 000 ninja  owww  well i hate to be a wet sock but well  i was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before i started riding myelf and i grew to hate long rides on sport bikes  the passenger seats are not designed for long rides  the passenger positions arent even usually designed for short rides  i ended up torturing my knees and my back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes  one of the reasons i originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had a bmw   id suggest a shorter extended ride at first  a short turn in the mountains or some such  then see how much pain shes in and proceed from there  the best advice id give a beginning passenger   dont get on the bike until the rider says its ok and work out some sort   signal for the rider to tell you when its ok to get off  after i get on    the bike i squeeze my riders hips to tell that im ready and at the stop   he nods his head to show its ok for me to get off   keep your feet on the pegs at all times  dont wiggle unless your rider   asks you to    the best passengers are those which are unobtrusive  echo the movements   and lean of your rider  look over the shoulder thats most comfortable   but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn   get used to your riders shifting style riders  use a reasonably   consistent shifting style  avoid helmet bonk  helmet bonk is    when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change   in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk hishers  it   gets old real fast   when pulling to a stop put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep   your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank  putting your hands   on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if youre in pain   but im told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there   switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders but be    sure and squeeze your thighs while youre doing it so your rider knows youre   still there   the guard rail isnt as safe as holding onto your rider   dont be afraid to ask for frequent stops if youre in pain or   losing feeling in your feet  passenger seats are not generally designed    for comfort  work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand      laura lemay                              lemaynetcomcom writer of trifles in shadows and blood

  sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human we have all the advantages  i agree with this 000 after all when you grab under his chin and are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head what is he going to do  tailwag you to death i even had one occasion where i was unexpectedly jumped by a 000 lb german shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other now im holding his mouth open no way is he strong enough to clamp down and he can do nothing  however all this macho shit aside the fact is that when you are riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly  by all means if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention stop and stay there if you kick the dog and ride away that is a victory for the dog  it drove you out of its territory it is not even a qualified victory it is a victory if you kick it and stop and sit there 00 of dogs will say oh shit this guys serious and back off now you have established your dominance over the dog and it probably will not bother you again  llamas however are a different story if you stop near a llama it will just hop on and insist on a ride and thats if youre lucky if it doesnt like you itll barf you off the bike and steal it   curtis jackson   cjacksonmvusadobecom00 hawk gt00 maxim 000 dod0000 kotb  00 black lab mix studley doright  00 colliegolden george there is no justification for taking away individuals freedom  in the guise of public safety  thomas jefferson

  i bought a yamaha xs000 with 0k miles  over the last 0 years ive put 00k of commute miles onnit  valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every 0k  well every 00k or so ive checked the pad clearences and they never change  if anything the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which makes no sense to me with the pad system  the pads should wear until the clearances are too great right  i know that threaded adjusters can tighten  up but i didnt think these kind could  bottom lines is that i havent touched my valves for 00k on this bike and they are still nice and quiet and if anything the clearances are tighter whats the deal  any other yam triple owners notice extremely long valve adjustment intervals

   egreeneastsuncom ed green  pixel cruncher writes  basically there are two ways to steer a horse plowrein and neckrein  plowreining steers him by keeping the reins separate and you pull in the direction you wish to go  neckreining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand and pulling against the horses neck in the direction you wish to go  when training a plowsteering horse to neckrein one technique is to cross the reins under his necks  thus when neckreining to the left the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit which the horse is used to from his plowreining days  i learned when riding bareback as a kid to palmreign by just  pushing on the right side of the horses neck with your right palm to turn  left  a lot like countersteering so that came pretty easy to me in the  transition to motorcycles it took a while however to break my habit of  kicking the rear fender with my heels to go faster  steve  steve l moseley                                  moseleyuwashingtonedu microbiology sc00                                phone 000 0000000 university of washington                          fax   000 0000000 seattle wa 00000  
  do any honda gurus know if i can replace the  the front sprocket on my 0000 honda cb000k with a slightly larger one i see this as being preferable to reducing the size of the rear one  thats a twincam right  theres a steel guard right next to the sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the engine cases and its needed  theres probably not enough room to fit a bigger sprocket  id be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a 0 ratio change rather than adding one to the front for about 0  if you raise the overall gear ratio too much youll impair the bikes rideability because the gears will be far enough apart that there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at any given speed  honda 000s dont have the widest of power bands       chuck karish          karishmindcraftcom     000 0000000 x000   karishpangeastanfordedu

  in article 00000rdhydroonca jlevinerdhydroonca jody levine writes in article 0qc000c0rsixguneastsuncom egreeneastsuncom writes  singletrack snow vehicles with front skis and snow skis attached to skiers legs deform the surface of the snow creating their own bank ice skates alter the phase of the ice and also carve out their own tracks so what   so they have bugger all to do with motorcycles  hence any apparent similarity in handling characteristics may or may not be analagous in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling characteristics  ok as one last attempt ill take a different tack  we all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle the question is is one of the effect dominant and which one is it the idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar  lets look at the one that so far has sparked no controversy on its own gyroscopic precession to examine this alone we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force the wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike through suspension so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way similar to a bikes an experiment would be to ride a bike along  a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning then change  surfaces to something that wont transmit forces through the contact  patches and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans it  probably would since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice  but we wouldnt get a good idea of how well or what it feels like  because without the contact patches we cant turn  maybe theres a  better way besides even ice doesnt get rid of the contact patch forces altogether so wed have to find a really frictionless surface youd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it  looking at the contactpatch effect only however is fairly simple now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle but without rotating wheels how it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant were just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways and skis or skates would do fine i dont know of any snowski or skate bikes but up here we have the suzuki wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels i think the propellor is in front of the rear ski or something like that but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect now i admit that this is second hand info although id love to try one of these but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle in that you countersteer it to turn so we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bikes a similar suspension arrangement and no gyroscopes but we do have countersteering  conclusion you dont need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcyclelike contact patch arrangements we still dont know what real effect the gyroscopes have when theyre there but from my observations of how handlebar angle force etc relate to steering in general im  willing to bet that theyre not the dominant factor in countersteering   if you dont like this conclusion then dont accept it but my motorcycles behaviour is consistent with it if someone can prove otherwise go ahead  ive        bike                      like        jody levine  dod 000 kv      got a       you can        if you      pf   jodyplevinehydroonca                          ride it                  toronto ontario canada  
  do i have to be the one to say it  dont be so stupid as to leave your helmet on the seat where it can fall down and go boom  true enough i put it on the ground if its free of spooge or directly on my head otherwise  that kind of fall is what the helmet is designed to protect against  not exactly the helmet has a lot less energy if your head isnt in it and theres no lump inside to compress the liner against the shell is a drop off the seat enough to crack the shell i doubt it but you can always send it to be inspected  ive        bike                      like        jody levine  dod 000 kv      got a       you can        if you      pf   jodyplevinehydroonca                          ride it                  toronto ontario canada  
  the other day it was raining cats and dogs therefor i was going only to the speed limit on nothing more on my bike this guy in his bmw was driving 00 meters behind me for 0000 meters and at the next red light i calmly put the bike on its leg walked back to this car he rolled down the window and i told him he was a total idiot and the reason why  did i do the right thing  well i used to get mad and either try to communicate my anger to jerks or to uhm educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic now i just try to get them off my tail  in heavy traffic i slow down a bit mostly so i have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind but i also often find that the  jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes switch into one of them and pass me  which is fine because then i can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind while looking ahead rather than from in front while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors  in traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass i might pull over as if to look for a street number or name still ignoring the jerk just to get the jerk off my tail    if this all sounds well wimpy or undenizenly or pessimistic or perhaps  for any psych types passiveaggressive consider that i prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding rather than from yelling at jerks    a ride can improve my whole day while yelling at a jerk is likely for me to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger  in the worst case yelling at the jerk could ruin my life  since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed with the cage than i am on a bike   on the other hand you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic and thus off your tail or crossing illegally hopefully in front of the waiting police  like almost everything here your choices and mileage will vary   denis mckeon galwaychtmeeceunmedu

  about a year and half ago when i first started riding i took a msf course i have taken those lessons to heart  over the past year i have had only a few  near collisions with traffic morons on four wheels  yesterday i got to add another to the list but with this one i felt the most helpless  i am sitting at a light about 0  0 car lengths behind a car a wise decsion  suddenly i  hear screeching tires  i dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize its the  moroon flying up right behind me in my panic i pop my clutch and stall the bike  luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel  i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you really in actuality avoid such an incident  suggestions  
  the tachometer has a sticker right on it that says for the first 000  miles do not go over 0000 rpms and for the next 000 miles dont go over 0000  referred to as the breakin period if you didnt know  well if i were to do that i would never be going over 00 mph even in 0th gear  so my question is will it hurt my new cycle to take it up  in the 00000 rpm range so that i can at least go the speed limit  but you already can go at the speed limit at 0000 rpm  all you need to do is to find a road with a 00 mph speed limit  this isnt quite as silly as it sounds  if you take a nice day trip over back roads not highways full of people trying seriously to get from here to there then you might be able to hold 00 mph comfortably you could easily do 000 miles over three different weekends  you might even get to enjoy some of the scenery  yes i know this is probably not why you bought a 000 called ninja   david karr karrcscornelledu  00 bmw r00   dod 0000   also bmwmoa nra aclu et al

   i am having trouble starting keeping running my 0000 cbr000f0  i have had problems with it since last year but it seemed to have subsided  now its back again  problem persists regardless of choke usage pattern gasoline type brand  octane and pretty much anything else i can imagine to change  the dealer is stumped its still under warranty  i start the bike  it runs great for a while 0000 seconds then the engine starts to slow down  decreasing the idle setting will increase the engine speed  increasing the choke increases the engine speed  regardless the engine will eventually slow down and stop    once stopped it will not restart even after flooded engine drill  if i let it sit 0000 minutes it starts beautifully and runs great for ever so i go out ride it hard for 000 miles and bring it back ride it easy  for a few miles to let it cool down and put it away  next day i go thru the same drill to get it going  any ideas  has anyone seen this before  another f0 rider had similiar problems and this is the mail i sent him hope this helps resolve you problem  at      allen tobias writes    check the vent tube to the tank sometimes the tube is clogged or constricted    this prevents gas from flowing into the carbs because of the vacuum created by    the displacement of the gasoline this is the small tube on the bottom of the     tank the large tube is the overflow you will have to remove the left side    tail section to get access to this area         good luck      but if it was clogged wouldnt this interfere with engine operation all  the time  when it runs it runs well    good point did not catch this in the original post the only other things  which come to mind since this is a gravity feed fuel system is this the fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the 0 carburator let suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the vacuum valve in the fuel petcock when it is cold the hole is open enough to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on  since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas  and as the engine and surrounding area warm up the hole seals up   one way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side  panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs connect a tube of the  correct size preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow on the output side of the fuel petcock remove the control hose from 0 carburator make sure the tank is full place the valve in the on position and apply vacuum  to the control hose preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge to check  for air leaks with vacuum applied fuel should flow freely to see if there is a vent problem do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed if it  flows a lot faster with the filler cap open then there may be something in  the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog  or partially clog the vent i have heard of some f0 fuel tanks being replaced  to fix this problem so the things which might be defective are the control hose from 0 carb the petcock valve and possibly the fuel tank vent  now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold then there  is something in the carbs screwed up but there are so many things to check  i would be typing all day to list them all   here are a few with everything back together apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow open up the airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs there are quite a few on each carb  i hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting if american honda does not resolve this get mad as hell and report them to the bbb and call the honda customer service hotline it is a 000 number but i dont recall it off the top of my head i called just about tires for my f0 and a few days later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how i liked the support i received here would be your chance to tell them what you think  buy the service manual on the f0 it is an invaluable source of information for working on your bike and i might add trouble shooting

  so how do i steer when my hands arent on the bars open budweiser in  david gibbs replies just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer ill supply one  yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar to countersteering  basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to  i guess i was semiserious without using my hands i lean and the bike  turns when leaning a torque is applied at a 00deg angle to the front  wheels axle just as in countersteering however this torque is also about  00deg from the axis of the steering head instead of making the  bike lean gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn but i dont remember  which way  rick  oh yeah i tried this in the driveway on the centestandas suggested  somewhere else but it doesnt seem to work the same     rick clarke  clarkebdrcbdcom ama somethingsomething

   i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you really in actuality avoid such an incident  suggestions  an even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and the car in front but enough to manuver around it  keep the bike in 0st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in hows that for engageddisengaged until there are two cars stopped behind you  when the next bdi cager comes screaching in simply ride up along side of the car in front of you  you dont need to panic and do it or you will pop the clutch and stall the engine  do is smoothly just rapidly  the cage in front of you will provide much better protection than anything else particularly empty road   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

  this is maybe not a pet peeve but definitely a playmate peeve  any lock including the kyptonite utypes are easy to break into if the person has the proper supplies andor motivation 0 minutes and your bike is gone i would be glad to explain but i dont want to contribute to any unlawful activities   does this make anyones skeptic alarm tm go off  no offense bill i dont mean to say that youre not being straight but i wonder how you know about this  have you actually every used your secret method to break all the different kinds of bike locks  or are you taking someones word for it  the fact is it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to go into a successful bikestealing business because they read anything in recmotorcycles  so please tell us what you are talking about  we cant even protect against an assault or discuss methods if you dont come out with it  see i have heard the ones about the pipes and the liquid nitrogen and the cordless dremel tools and a bunch of other ones  the most plausable method i am not a bike thief so i really dont know for certain is just to put a rod through each wheel and use four guys to just lift the bike into a truck  this works because most people dont lock their bikes to anything since that method is so childishly easy i figure a nice visible chain or cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on to the next bike  hey finally an advantage to the weight and high cg of the concours    especially since i have a bike that i would hate to see ripped off by such a trival tactic warning no lock alone is a safe deterent against theft the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lockpicker to walk away with your property  i personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned  what tactic are you referring to  if we dont know what you are talking about we cant very well guard against it can we  for my money literally i rely on a combination of a motiondetector alarm with pager when im out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area cc insurance and i try to park in obvious visible areas with lots of people about  see if someone just plays with the bike without intention of stealing it at least some eyes are on it and if they get too rambunctious theyll set off the alarm  thats for a nice bike  for a ratbike the trick is to always keep its actual value well below bluebook so that it looks so crappy nobody would want to steal it and even if they were stupid enough to you would make a profit on the deal    seriously if i for instance need to go on a business trip for a week and sadly have to leave the bikes sitting they both get a shittylooking but useable cover locked on and both bikes locked to each other and a curb bumper in the parking lot under the light  i usually rig the cable locks i use aircraft cable so that if anyone pulls on either bike or the cable joining them the concours alarm goes off  and i have a friend come buy every day to have a look and make sure theyre still there  the only thing i have ever had stolen was a 00 cover and that was over  winter storage with the battery out of the bike and thus no alarm  oh put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through and place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off  thats the best that i can think of  most of the locks i see people put on bikes look well not too mechanically sound  i like abus since i have personally removed master locks from lockers with my boot  dave svoboda svobodavoidrtsgmotcom     im getting tired of 00 concours 0000 mmmmmmmmmm                beating you up dave 00 rz 000 ring ding woops                you never learn ama 000000  dod 0000  cog 000  chicago      beth bruiser dixon

  my kawasaki kz 000 l0 has 00 millimetres of play on the gearchange pedal axle in other words i can move the axle sideways  upanddown for few millimetres to each direction this doesnt bother me when riding but i guess fixing it wouldnt hurt last summer i took the bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted and the mechanic mentioned that it should be an easy job all i would have to do is to remove the front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that i would find there well upon a closer inspection i discovered that the gearchange axle doesnt even run through the sprocket cover it seems that in addition to removing the cover i would have at least to remove the sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket  question  would removing this small cover from the left side of the engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushingseal dont know the exact term in english sorry   question  has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some other purpose  does the oil for example stay inside the engine   thanks   teppo nieminen dod 0000 zoo mc helsinki finland

  rwertwellsfcaus bob wert writes  are there traditional signals for slow down or go faster or i hafta go pee etc  my experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means slow down  seriously concentrate on being very smooth and you will make her experience much more enjoyable  even a normal upshift causes your passenger to bob so i ease off the throttle before pulling in the clutch to eliminate this  its more work but your passenger will appreciate it  also ive found that using more rear brake than normal helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops which makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on  if youre going sport riding have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves against the tank so you dont have to bear both your weights with your arms  again your bike will dive less too    paul thompson    apple computer

  lottohusc0harvardedu jerry lotto writes  there has been a running thread on the need to understand countersteering  i have seen a lot of opinion but not much of it has any basis in fact or study  the bottom line is  the understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among the accidentinvolved riders in the hurt study  the average rider does not identify that countersteering alone provides the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themselves even after many years of practice  i would agree entirely with these three paragraphs but did the hurt study make any distinction between an ability to swerve and a failure to swerve in most of the accidents and near accidents that ive seen riders will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare simply because the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it overrides everything else hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive manouvres  did hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable

   there was an article in one of the uk dailies this week about a soccer goalkeeper who had to be carried off the field after a collision with a ford sierra cage  seems the cage driver wanted to turn around but needed to drive onto the pitch to do this so he waited till the ball and most of the players were up the other end unfortunately as soon as he started his manouvre someone booted the ball back down the pitch the goalkeeper ran backwards towards his goal straight into the cage

  a few random thoughts on riding with a passenger  theres no substitute for a bike with sufficient power having taken passengers very occasionally on the small 000 etc bikes i used to ride in the uk it was hard  im now riding a gs0000 and thats great even moving from my freinds gsx000 i was riding recently this may be due in part to the fact that neither i nor my regular passengers are particularly slimline   i always tell passengers stay in line with the bike on corners that makes their movements predictable  my regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all i dont really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods again that may be biased by the fact that ive had a couple of new passengers a friend recently for her first time on a bike who hold on to me real tight making any kind of maneuvering difficult  ive also discovered that on longer trips i prefer a passenger who moves and shifts their weight a bit i recently took a work collegue to a meeting about a 0 hour ride and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also sitting very still and getting a sore back  we have a code system for turns stop and for i need to shift position   chris seabrook fujitsu open systems solutions inc  phone 00000000000x000 0000 hollis street emeryville ca 000000000 usa  fax   00000000000                                                     dod    0000              per saltire gules and or a sun counterchanged  
  unable to stand the pain anymore my wife bought the corbin gunfighter and lady with passenger backrest for my hawk gt  it came with no instructions but it came 0 weeks earlier than they said it would  installation would have been very easy but the seat fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with the stock seat  it never was easy to put on  once i figured that out the new seat went on the first try  the passenger backrest though does not fit as i thought it might  the supplied screw to set the  backrest angle does not fit and i have not yet found a suitable  hard  sae grade 0 or perhaps 0  0000 bolt that fits  there is a a soft bolt in there now  just dont lean back  the drivers section of the seat is a bit wider  seems comfortable enough but then again i put about 0000 miles on the stock seat without a thought  the passengers section has about 0 times the  volume of foam that the stock seat has and from my short test it seems much more comfortable  the backrest helps a bit but ive not  has enough time to really test it  the backrest also comes with a  small pocket  its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the  00 taller seat  if i go on the threenotch ride soon  dixville pinkham  smugglers ill give a more complete report but in general it seems like an improvement    frank evan perdicaro xyvision color systems       legalize guns drugs and cashtoday000 edgewater drive    inhouse frankmarvin x0000wakefield ma outhouse frankcontexcom 0000000000x0000000000000

  hi  im not sure what the other guy cant track down his post for his name was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable they are  theres a space between each link where the teeth of the  locking head notch in  thus each link is a possible locking point  also and this is not applicable to hardcore thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxyacetylene torches the cobralinks look a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks imho and i think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to boredjoyridersnominallyadeptat crackingunsecuredbike deterrence as long as the lock is nominally  functional  finally i notice that when i ride with my leathers harness boots and the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier btw ive crashed in the rain dressed like this and the lock didnt pulverize any vertebrae cagers give me a much wider berth dont hassle me and tend to avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights  i love my cobralinks almost as much as i love my pre00s honda dinosaur i think i have a pavlovian drool reflexi put the lock on ie on my body and i can feel the bike already shaking away  my first post  what did i do wrong   sang dod 0000 00 cx000  ps any other cx000 owners out there  please email me got  questions about the weird handling on my bike      the opinions expressed are not necessarily those of the university of      north carolina at chapel hill the campus office for information         technology or the experimental bulletin board service            internet  launchpaduncedu or 00000000

  because riding a passenger doesnt really depend on the type of bike the things you want a passenger to donot do is the same  ergo if hes asking advice i reasoned he doesnt have much practice period  if you say he does fine  i still wouldnt take the uninitiated up a road thats all switch backs and reversecenteruncrowned roadway not to mention the bdcs and squids who will also be on that particular road  he asked for advice and even though it wasnt what he meant i still consider it some of the best ive read   lee

   another good place for your helmet is your mirror  i kid you not if you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors that screw into your handlebars your helmet should fit over your mirror and be fairly stable  be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the mirror  it will depress the foam liner in the helmet  that is not the kind of foam that bounces back like foam rubber  its purpose in life is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin if your mirror compresses it there is that much less energy absorbing capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash  i found the right handlebar to be a good spot if on the sidestand hang with the chinbar facing up balanced across the grip and brake lever such that the weight of the helmet doesnt compress any of the chinbar foam  this is more challanging with an open face helmet   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

   0  all of us that argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand the technique of countersteering  including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner  well all the way through a decreasingradius corner anyway  this is really the only thing we disagree on maybe we should agree to disagree   ok but im right    the official line here though i do have my doubts about it is that the front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place   if thats the official line taught in those rider education classes you were refering to that also dont teach countersteering i have to question the quality of the classes  the official line in msf curricula is as i described  maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it and increasing braking on the front as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift  the official line you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it  applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0 and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0  saying brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless advice to a newbie  he has to go out and slide the tire to find out where that is  it also gives him zero information from which to develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and corresponding weight shift develop  if you dont slide the tyre you have no way of knowing whether youve achieved maximum braking or not im not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can  but if you want to find the limits of the machine you have to go beyond them   not necessarily true  chirping the tire indicates impending lockup on most surfaces and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking  i agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like code used to use  in any case for maximum braking if as i suggested you aim to keep both wheels just on the point of sliding then youll be doing exactly as you suggest  true but from the point of view of how to best teach riding skills which is how this discussion started keep both wheels just on the point of sliding is nearly useless information  you need to teach a technique or at least a strategy to achieve this   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do

     various posts about shafties cant do wheelies      no mike  it is imposible due to the shaft effect  the centripital effects    of the rotating shaft counteract any tendency for the front wheel to lift    off the ground    good point johna buddy of mine told me that same thing when i had my  bmw r00gs i dumped the clutch at 0000rpm hey ito nly revved to 0 or so and  you know what he was right    uh folks the shaft doesnt have diddleysquatpoop to do with it i can get  the front wheel off the ground on my 0 ferchrissake  you may have been able to bounce the front up but not actually do a wheelie see the shaft effect unloads the rear susspension and effectivly loads the front this is why a shaft bike should accelerate if it starts scraping in a corner   laz

  ive never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent  experience passengering with dave edmondson at pilot while in london   i found that it upset the bike much less if i rode with the pilot that is if i looked over his shoulder and anticipated when i should hold on hard for braking or acceleration i tried to always look over the inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible leaving dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and  luggage  hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit  off the back is hard to fight similarly i held on to the grab handles tightly when dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp im a lot bigger than he is reaching around him and pushing off the  tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for  him to manage  on the rare occasions when i carry a passenger myself i absolutely refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding thats helmet jacket gloves stout pants and shoesboots as a minimum its  not my responsibility to provide this gear but its my responsibility to require it if they want to ride  and i agree with an earlier poster if youve not had much experience carrying a particular passenger and especially if youve not carried many passengers before take a few gentler rides of some duration before you head off to a difficult road like minesmt hamilton thats a  nasty place to find yourself in trouble  godfrey digiorgi  ramarrenapplecom   dod 0000      ama000000  rule 0 never sell a ducati          the street finds its own  rule 0 always obey rule 0           uses for things wg  ducati cinelli toyota krups nikon sony apple telebit

  my previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something ive weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method slow down to screw up dogs triangulation of target then take off and laugh at the dog now far behind you this time it didnt work because i didnt have time riding up the hill leading to my house i encountered a liverandwhite springer spaniel no relation to the springer softail or the springer spagthorpe a close relation to the spagthorpe viking actually the dog encountered me with intent to harm  but i digress i was riding near the unpainted centerline of the roughly 00foot wide road doing between forty and sixty clicks 00 mph for the velocityimpaired the dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed i later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch about thirty feet away heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road i saw the dog and before you could say sipde he was on me boom i took the dog in the left leg and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike and cracking one panel i think i saw the dog spin around when i looked back but my memory of this moment is hazy  i next turned around and picked the most likely looking house the apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt cut mouth and hoped i was not hurt either i could feel the pain in my shin and expected a cool purple welt to form soon sadly it has not so im left with a tender shin and no cool battle scars  interestingly the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course the not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact delayed pain may have helped me here as i didnt feel a sudden sharp pain that i can remember  what worries me about the accident is this i dont think i could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than i was this is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area but i was riding around the speed limit i worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog but i console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane bdi cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 0000 mph for that matter how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 00 mph by the end  i eagerly await comment  ryan cousinetc0000 yamaha vision xz000 black pig of invernesslive to ride kotrb          0000 ajs 000 cs king rat                      to work to dod 0000      id be a squid if i could afford the bike    flame to ryancousineaucompdynquestororg     vancouver bc canada   live        slmr 00a  hes hurt dammit jim im a doctor  oh right                                                                                           computer dynamics bbs    0000000000hst    0000000000v00 vancouver bc canada   easy access low rates friendly sysop

     i have a question about tires for my guzzi it is a 00 000t the tires that were on it when i just bought it are old and cracked i do not have an owners manual for it yet but the tires listed in the haynes manual are front 000 h 00  rear 000 h 00 and pressures recommended are 00 front and 00 rear oddly the pressure for the same tire on the t0 is listed at 00 psi instead anyone know the reason as i know though the pressure i should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires i purchase  the real question i have is this the old tires that are on the bike are for the front a metzler touring special 000 h 00 and for the rear an avon roadrunner 000 h 00 00000 h 00 as marked on each tire both are larger than that listed in the haynes manual what does the owners manual recommend and was it common to go up one size for this bike also this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities  the above sizes are inches except for the additional mark on the current rear tire what is the best metric match the local bmw dealer thought 00000 h 00 on the front and 00000 h 00 on the back he also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices  i am thinking of going with a metzler me00 laser possibly comp k on the front and me00 on the back both in mbs variety if possible the longer  lasting belting system i already use the me00 on both the vision and fj for the front and like it and i thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the guzzi that the me00 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a me00 might as well as giving much better tire milage life any comments  a friend told me he thought that my bike had boranni rims which are very good but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls i do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time so aside from warning the shop to be careful any other comments i should make i havnt looked at the rim to check out the make yet if it is marked he just told me late yesterday and i havnt had a chance to check the rim type  on another note i will remove the ugly but in good shapeanyone want it vetter fairing and i will run without a windscreen for a while but eventually i would like a simple rounded cafe style quarter fairing for it it could be forkhandlebar mounted any suggestions is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe style for this bike how about lower barsclipons for it i would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe style yes i know to be picky that period really predates this bikeit is just that this bike has such potential for that look  edward walshhewlettpackard company                              edwboihpcom  disk memory division ms000                              0000000000   po box 00  boiseidaho 00000                              00fj000000xz000rjvision00guzzi000tdod00  edward walshhewlettpackard company                              edwboihpcom  disk memory division ms000                              0000000000   po box 00  boiseidaho 00000                              00fj000000xz000rjvision00guzzi000tdod00

  earlier i was reading on the net about using splitfire plugs  one guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell  well i saw one think that someone said about show me a team that used split fires  well heres some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages  splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 0x0 cages  well for these guys splitfires  now i dont know about all of this and im trying to catch up with somebody about it now but splitfires should help twins more than  splitfires work mainly by providing a moreorless unshrouded spark to the combustion chamber if an engines cylinder head design can benefit from this then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase most noticeably in lower rpm range torque splitfires didnt do diddlysquat for my 0000 gmc pickup 00l v0 but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 0000 harley sportster 0000 and my best friends 0000 sportster 000 folks i know whove tried them in 0000 evo motors cant tell any performance boost over plain plugs which is interesting since the xlh and big twin evo combustion chambers are pretty much the same shape just different sizes two of my friends who have shovelhead harleys swear by the splitfires but if i had a shovelhead id dualplug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense plus they look really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head    neal howard   00 xlh0000      dod 000      computrac inc richardson tx       doh 0000000000   000o00      nealcmptrclonestarorg       std disclaimer my opinions are mine not computracs          let us learn to dream gentlemen and then perhaps           we shall learn the truth  august kekule 0000

      request for opinions     which is better  a onepiece aerostitch or a twopiece aerostitch    like most everyone else i ended up getting two different sizes for the top and bottom  my top is a 00l and the bottom is a 00l  for the bottom the waist is far too large but the thighs fit just right the 00 had a better waist but cut off the circulation in my legs i have large muscular thighs and no i didnt use the thighmaster to get them   the jacket fits me ok in the chest slightly snug at the waist and too small in the arms  i cant imagine finding a onepiece size that would have fit correctly as even the 0 piece has its problems strange since my vpilot jacket fits great all over and when i tried the matching pants they fit like a glove as well  i can only assume the models aero design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks  also even though its related to convienience you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands ive gotten some really suspicious looks and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit since you cant fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised except the trunk in my sidecar rig   with the two piece i unzip the pants i generally leave the two pieces zipped together primarily because the pants fall down unless i pull the cheesy elastic belttype band real tight stuff them in one of my spacious bmw saddlebags the pants just fit and run errands just wearing the jacket  actually if i know ill be running errands i just wear my vpilot jacket but thats just me  as far as crash protection id say that both suits are probably equal  it seems that for weather protection if anything the 0 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 0 inches  the 0 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist just because of the extra layer of stuff but maybe not  so id have to vote for the two piece  despite the slightly odd fit i still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing i own  wouldnt go long distance without it  ken wallich wallichncdcom  kenwallichcom  kmwalorg  decwrlvixieamberken  ken wallich wallichncdcom  kenwallichcom  kmwalorg  decwrlvixieamberken

  a few months ago in one the the motorcycle mags there was an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to be available thru bmw  the idea was that the tape would look black in sunlight and reflect in other colors at night to headlights  it sounded like a nice way to add nighttime  visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction  i talked to the local bmw dealer about this  i was told that the  only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector was it being  used in a coming line of bmw clothing rainsuits  he wasnt aware  of anything regarding self applied tape  has anyone come across this from bmw or any other source  thanks   steve bunis  sun microsystems     dod 000000st0000               itasca il  ama 00000000kz000

  any lock including the kyptonite utypes are easy to break into if the person has the proper supplies andor motivation 0 minutes and your bike is gone i would be glad to explain but i dont want to contribute to any unlawful activities especially since i have a bike that i would hate to see ripped off by such a trival tactic warning no lock alone is a safe deterent against theft the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lockpicker to walk away with your property  i personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned  bill

   i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 000 ninja  this will be the the first time ive taken anyone for an extended ride  read farther than around the block    well be riding some twisty   fairly bumpy roads the mines roadmthamilton loop for you sf bay areans    this person is 000 lbs and fairly small so i dont see weight as too much  of a problem but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go  my fiancee and i do quite a bit of sporty riding 0up  ill tell you  what weve found and the systems weve worked out   on starts accelerate much slower than usual  its tough for the rider to judge how scary fast acceleration is because were holding onto something and leaning forward  remember this   on turns have her lean forward and at the same angle as you normally  this means she isnt leaning at all  its very disconcerting to be leaned over and have your passenger leaning so that theyre sitting straight up much balance is lost and this can be dangerous   on slowing and stopping do so much slower than usual  again its tough  for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is because were holding  onto something and leaning forward  however youll figure it out fast because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you which  shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location   generally have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike not  out wide  this helps balance and gives her somegrip   when you passenger is in fear she will squeeze her knees against you normally this means slow down and do it now      turning so she leans with me but what else  are there traditional  signals for slow down or go faster or i hafta go pee etc  we only have a couple signals  slow down is her either tapping me on  the back or slapping my helmet with all her might  depends on the urgency of the matter   turn here is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit  this is also the sign for cool  look at that  i hafta pee is the same sign as turn here  im hungry is the same sign  go faster is usually done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee  i usually see slow down more often than go faster    i really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that  shell want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated  the best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy and  pillion on his or her bike  its incredibly frustrating because youre  in almost no control  now multiply that feeling times ten because you as a rider know what your bike will do and your passenger will likely feel youre about to scrape hard parts all the time or lock up the brakes at any moment or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain etc   pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad  also remember that its much more draining and tiring to ride 0up than by yourself because youre concentrating on much more and in the zen of the moment less  remember this      pat loughery patlomicrosoftcom seattle wa  dod 000 ama vme dioc 0ksi000  00 vfr000f 00 nighthawk 000 00 seca 000 turbo  for sale   
  i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 000 ninja this will be the the first time ive taken anyone for an extended ride read farther than around the block    well be riding some twisty  fairly bumpy roads the mines roadmthamilton loop for you sf bay areans  unless she is really adventurous do not take her on this route for her first extended ride thats kinda like taking someone on a noshow 00way speed star competition as their first skydive  this person is 000 lbs and fairly small so i dont see weight as too much of a problem but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go i want her to hold onto me     rather than the grab rail out back and ive heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction were turning so she leans with me but what else  are there traditional  0 if the ninja has adjustable suspension adjust it to a stiffer setting so you dont bottom out in bumpy curves  0 tell her the 0 cardinal rules are  a never ever ever ever put her feet down not when you stop at a stop sign not when she thinks youre gonna crash never keep them on the pegs until you tell her to get off the bike  b she is to hold onto your waist she should hold on tightly enough that she wont slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit and added bonus for you here she should keep as close to your butt as possible so quick stops dont make her slide into you and knock your balls up onto the gas tank you decide how best to word this  c just stay perpendicular to the bike straight up in the seat dont lean your body into curves just go with the bike and stay perpendicular dont look over your shoulder  0 remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back that means dont pop the clutch and try to corner and stop smoother than usual be aware that if you jump on the brake youre going to have the equivalent of a 000 lb dead weight crashing into you from behind so be prepared for that  0 make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesnt have to go no antiwomen stuff here i have a tiny bladder myself  0 remind her to look around while youre riding point to things of interest it makes the ride more enjoyable to her she wont get so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet and it gives her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at   my wife and i tried the msfrecommended look over the riders shoulder in curves bit and it just didnt work the timing of her weight shift was unpredictable especially on the maxim because unlike the ninja the upright riding position really restricts the pillions view of the road ahead next time i had her just remain perpendicular to the bike and i could hardly tell there was someone else on the bike in curves and she weighs substantially over 000 lbs   curtis jackson   cjacksonmvusadobecom00 hawk gt00 maxim 000 dod0000 kotb  00 black lab mix studley doright  00 colliegolden george there is no justification for taking away individuals freedom  in the guise of public safety  thomas jefferson

  okay doders heres a goddamn mystery for ya   today i was turning a 00 degree corner just like on any other day but there was a slight difference  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible thunk  i pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage  my bike is a kawasaki gpx000r with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a bankfollower or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 000banked turn  the stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 0 mm long which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg  now for the mystery  the stud on the side of the bike that clunked when i turned was absent  im fairly sure it was there before the event  there was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been  in fact the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously    okay all you engineering types how the fk do you explain this   how can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole in alloy without damaging the thread in the hole   is this some sort of hitech design thingo that kawasaki never mentioned like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact to let the stud rip out then changes back to a solid   im quite amazed at how this could have happened  in the meantime life goes on without a lefthand bankfollower  barry manor dod 000 confused accidental pegscraper

   lottohusc0harvardedu jerry lotto writes    the understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among  the accidentinvolved riders in the hurt study    the average rider does not identify that countersteering alone  provides the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themselves  even after many years of practice    i would agree entirely with these three paragraphs but did the hurt  study make any distinction between an ability to swerve and a failure  to swerve in most of the accidents and near accidents that ive seen riders  will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare simply because  the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it overrides  everything else hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive  manouvres  did hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable  apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isnt as strong  as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger  hurt found that a surprising number of accidentinvolved motorcyclists hadnt used their brakes at all prior to impact    i think the only way youll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in  a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you ever use and to practice it constantly even when you have no need to do any turning  if you follow me down a long straight and i seem to be  wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need its because im practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in my path  all of this practice may indeed be futile but if i have even milliseconds to react the most familiar tactic available and hopefully  the most automatic will be countersteering  the same logic applies to braking with the front brake of course  chuck rogers car000torreysattcom

  yesterday a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle dealer it has been a while since he last rode 00 years and i myself have never bought a new bike from a dealer what follows is an experience of that visit and of an observation of squildly behavior by other  customers andor sales personel  background  i ride with a group of friends who mainly are into cruiser type bikes my friend was hell bent on getting an intruder and had seen a few used ones he wanted to see what the new ones were going for so we happened upon a dealer that sold both suzuki and yamaha   the place was fairly busy so we browsed a bit we happened upon a few  intruders most of which had sold signs on my friend had been bitten  well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat i  moseid on outside the next thing i know i see 0 or 0 sport bikes pull in i could stereotype the type of riders backward ball hat oakley iq 00 but i wont well they went inside i didnt think much of it i figured to each his own i went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs firmly implanted into my friends back  when i noticed the hormone gang talking to other salesdroidsmanagers lots of laughter jokes etc no big deal  here is the part that concerned me the hg and those shop personel that were not busy with customers went back out where said hg members fired up their rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 000 beasts at this point one decided to see how much rubber  a katana 000 could deposit in the drive  squids i thought to myself but i was appalled that the salesdroidsmanager not only condoned this behavior but encourged it to the point were they were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour the girl that was riding pillion on another bike seemed rather hormonal about this display and urged her pilot to quickly catch up the others followed making sure there kerkers could be heard as well as felt  i felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist i felt the eyes of those in cages witnessing this display then glancing over to the dealers lot and damning all those on two wheels needless to say my friend felt a little uncomfortable and we left   i will now turn off my frustration and go ride peacefully to clear my anger i only hope that the cop who is following me home has an open mind and doesnt associate me with them   btw i cant afford a new bike

  hello folks  im very happy with my new r00gs  my range is 000 miles on 00 gallons thats 00 mpg  surprisingly the bike is a real cruiser  i was expecting something rough   shes a sweet backroad honey  and i can go pretty much anyplace id take my mountain bike  as far as shaft effect its more a  torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion  rev it sitting still when the driveshaft is not moving and the bike twists a bit  maybe  if the clutch is in then a large chunk of counterrotating mass is not rotating  hence at a light reving makes it twist  shaft effect is the rear end rising under power or the real problem getting lower to the road when the throttle is snapped shut say when you are cornering and the heads are real close to the road  new gs bikes with the paralever shaft have almost no shaft effect  i dont ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect but in my opinion a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence  okay here are  my questions  0 any recommendations for a homemade fairing  id like to keep the wind off my chest and perhaps my helmet for comfort at highway speeds 00 mph yet dont want to a screw up the stability or b block my vision too much for trail riding  anybody have luck with twopiece  detachible fairings  id like to make it myself out of plexiglas  0 i run two lights the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the crash bar  the illuminations excellent that way with a full beam coming out from the level of the motor left side the lamp beam is linear so that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right and it  really picks up the periphery deer lurking etc  combined with the  headlamp on high you can see like day  but ive heard that bmw alternators dont crank out too much  do i need to shut down the sidelamp when im puttering around in the dirt at low rpm    its a question of how long you spend at low rpm and how much you need the extra light  at low rpm 0k and under they dont charge all that much if at all  the alternators put out sufficient wattage it just that you need to be at 0k rpm to get it    0 this is embarassing im having trouble starting the bike first thing in the morning  i invariably flood the carbs then go in and read a section of the paper and then she starts right up  is this a zen thing   full choke  open the gas taps  hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the throttle  it should fire  cranking should be done with minimal throttle my r000 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle  its an experience thing  like zen its hard to describe  it can be hard to learn if you arent paying atttention to the differences between success and failure  especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the battery while trying to get it to run  if my bike has been sitting for a few weeks i give it a short while to start  if it doesnt i turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to vaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off  ive got dual plugs which make it easier to start  0 the haynes manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline with alcohol additives yeah right  what do you folks due to keep the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol  any  particular brands of gas that are best  additives  the big fix is the bing carb upgrade kit  its good for a few mpg and the parts are alcohol proof  the parts it replaces arent alcohol proof  as long as the bike isnt going to sit for long periods of time gasohol is nice since it helps keep ping away  if your bike doesnt ping on cheap gas you ought to raise the compression half a smiley the bmw twins of the 00s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the epa happy  dual plugs and higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance  neil kirby      dod 0000       nakarchiecbusaattcom att bell labs  columbus oh     usa 000 0000000 if you think i speak for att you might have more lawyers than sense

  warning warning may cause unpleasantness   i was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in milford nh with an assortment of other nedod folks when dean cookson  yes he has not left the  country yet mentioned that the wiring diagram of the vfr000  shows that  the light switch is a three position switch   high beam low beam both beams   well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a 0 position switch but sure enough as deam expected  when you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high and low beams go on  this provides a very nice light coverage of the road  this is true for the st00 and the vfr000 and i would expect for any  other late model honda with the standard two position light switch   its a make before break type of switch  if not required it ought to be for highlow beams    there might be a wee problem with this  if you use both filaments at the same time the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal possibly enough to shorten its life span  my honda crx cage a cage that really wanted to be a bike had wimpy stock lights  so we used to run around with both beams on  made a mucho big difference  until both low beam filaments died nearly simultaneously  this was two weeks after finding out how nice it was to use both beams  i replaced the lights with quartzhalogen lights and that ended the problem  neil kirby      dod 0000       nakarchiecbusaattcom att bell labs  columbus oh     usa 000 0000000 if you think i speak for att you might have more lawyers than sense

   my first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run a big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes i was riding with and tried  to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me he kicked the dog a  couple of times we were all only going about 0000mph and just made the dog angrier and got away by applying wfo and outrunning the dog who then started after yours truly at the time i had open drag pipes obnoxiously loud as hell and as soon as the dog was about 0 feet away from the right side of my bike i pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 0000rpm and the roar of the pipes frightened the dog away probably made the dogs ears hurt like hell and he didnt come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either   my second encounter was with an already deceased roadkill dog i wasnt paying  very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the carcass i looked down just in time to see what i was about to run over so i  just held onto the handlebars and freaked out both wheels went squarely over the dogs belly with a thumpthump just like running over a piece of a 0x0 lumber the bike didnt lose any stability at all and i kept on going after i got to my destination i found bits of fur meat and blood stuck to the bottom of my motor and frame gross    neal howard   00 xlh0000      dod 000      computrac inc richardson tx       doh 0000000000   000o00      nealcmptrclonestarorg       std disclaimer my opinions are mine not computracs          let us learn to dream gentlemen and then perhaps           we shall learn the truth  august kekule 0000

   another good place for your helmet is your mirror  i kid you not if you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors that screw into your handlebars your helmet should fit over your mirror and be fairly stable   butt butt then yu w0nt be able t0 ee the car neakg up behind yu and p0p a whhheeeeelllleeeee t0 dtchum and the chick dig it  seriously though putting a helmet on a mirror is inadvisable because you are then resting the weight of the helmet on the fragile foam liner that is expected to cushion your noggin  and once crushed that foam never pops back  a variation of mirror hanging thing is what i do with the bike on the sidestand hey the centerstand is for maintenance i turn the wheel to the stop left and can hang the helmet by the chinbar on the right grip  there is no crushable foam in the chinbar and it is pretty secure on there as long as the forks are locked  if i have to leave the helmet with the parked bike and the bags arent onfull that is about the most stable place  dave svoboda svobodavoidrtsgmotcom     im getting tired of 00 concours 0000 mmmmmmmmmm                beating you up dave 00 rz 000 ring ding woops                you never learn ama 000000  dod 0000  cog 000  chicago      beth bruiser dixon

   well as many a bored bike tourer can tell you the way to steer sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean  also known as leaning  say you want to turn left severely confused rambling about the ground pushing  but the front wheel has trail  if the ground pushes the front wheel  toward the left at the contact patch the trail will cause the  wheel to turn to the right  hey there we are  nohands counter steering  contersteering refers to pushing the inside handlebar to effect a lean  nohands countersteering is an oxymoron   ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker   edgreeneastsuncom   and i showed him a picture of you  i said dod 0000  0000000000  go on get to know her youll like her  the grateful dead   it seemed like the least i could do   
  after failing my state of new hampshire noise gestapo test with my hd slash cut pipes i installed my new bubs which i had been planning to do anyway went to a different in spection station and passed with no problem at about 00 db  two points  first i dont think the first dude did the noise test correctly  holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading and doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced the db level so if any other nh riders need to get this done make sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from the body  second these bub pipes are bloody terrific at low revs or cruising through town they as quiet as the stock pipes but have a sound thats a more throaty purring rumble  when you open her up to 0000 rpm they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar best of both worlds  russ hughes  00 fxstc  dod 000000e00 the chrome and steel she ridescollidin with the very air she breathes                n young

          quite right your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain  most of their charge if drained and dried well but id throw out the  electrolyte and buy some more when you need it           and before anyone says im wrong remember that new batteries almost  always come ready charged and dry and they are perfectly ok even after  several years storage at the shop    mark fox     makes sense to me after all when steel is manufactured and stored they put oil on it so it wont rust logicaly when you store your bike you must strip the paint and put oil on the metal to prevent rus

  quick question  what are the advantages of slipons versus your stock exhaust versus aftermarket exhaust systems i dont see many people using slipons but they are heavily advertised and half as expensive  thanks dave   cost is lower than oem replacements and they weigh less also in most  instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more  performance i replaced my oem canister with an ontario systems slip on the midrange performance is better but i also notice a slight stumble at  00k rpm after talking to kaz yoshima the developer and manufacturer of  the slip on he thinks i might need larger pilot idle jets was not suppose to but maybe where i live makes a difference altitude barometric pressure anyway besides that minor glitch i like the slip on performance and the sound which is louder than stock but not loud enough to annoy folks the ontario  slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full  throttle  just remember every bike is a tuned system when you change the intake or exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer you may have to change other areas to compensate like a complete change of the exhaust system header and muffler changes the exhaust characteristic to the point which rejetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathingpumping profile  talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if they have used it on your particular bike check with people who have the system also to see what they think about there slip on  also as a last data point in sport riders first issue did a review on a group of header and exhaust systems for the cbr000f0 they also included as a  side bar the ontario slip on the dyno showed an increase from stock of 0bhp at the rear wheel 00 verses 00   buyer beware of outrageous claimed increases in horse power it may have been  true in the past but not today  at                                                                                                                                         00                                            0000 cbr000f0             allen tobias           technical    email                   convex computer corp  marketing    tobiasconvexcom        0000 waterview parkway                                         richardson tx 00000                                                  this bike is awesome and im fearless lets gojay gleason   
  it sure would be nice if someone would start making replacements for oem exhausts that were would be cheaper but not louder  i read about a supertrapp system called ear that was supposed to be quiet enough to pass some european standards  apparently its not on the market yet  yoshimura makes a few systems that are supposed to be kind of quiet they are also really light  im planning on getting one of these  systems soon and will post the results   mark  mark s burnham markbwcnovellcom ama000000  dod0000  alfa romeo gtv0                             00 ninja 000   
   i saw this posted and it brings an interesting event to mind     the reactions of little boys seems to be the most enthusiastic to a wave and also good to see  i always wave when i see a kid that has at least noticed my bike  i figure it helps the future of the sport  i have to admit that i usually try to do so without the parental figure noticing  im afraid that the kid will get yelled at for associatign with antisocietal types like us   a few weeks ago i was in the dmv with ken i was standing in a mile long  line waiting for some really bored looking person to fleece a bunch of  people from some dough ken was sitting on a chair next to our helmets  wondering why everybody there looked to be about the social calibur of  people you would find at a laundromat when some young woman walked in who  required our conferring attentions he came over and stood in line with me  while we watched her fill out some forms and then we noticed a little kid  about 0 years old reach over the bench and touch our helmets one at a time  i didnt particularly mind and neither did ken that the kid was touching  our helmets that is but the helmets werent on the most stable of  platforms so ken scooted over there to resettle them and as soon as he  touched the helmets mother of said child started shrieking at her kid you  stay away from those you shit and whopped the tyke brutally about the head  and shoulders  i suppose it was our scary sex drugs and unix tshirts that sent such  bouts of terror through her body
