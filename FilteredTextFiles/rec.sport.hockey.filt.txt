 however imnsho neither team would have seen a marked improvement in attendance if the team record did not improve  in the year before lemieux came pittsburgh finished with 00 points  following his arrival the pens finished with 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 and 00 points with a couple of                            stanley cups thrown in        it was at this point the pens attendance was near capacity 00 out of 00  sellouts yet they hadnt made the playoffs since 0000  how do you explain a 0th place team breaking attendance records when they havent been to the playoffs in 0 years  mario lemieux is the explanation imho    you could make a case that the expectation of an improving team that would make the playoffs is the reason   funny you should mention itthis is exactly the case i was going to make  but i think the reason is lemieux had a 000 point season and was the first nongretzky to win the hart and ross since 0000  people turned out to watch him play   i will grant that a star like mario will draw fans even if the team sucks  but this is short term only i still do not think the attendance increase  will last unless the team is a winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking one  pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support them  if they suddenly dropped to say 00 points youd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon    also the following year 0000 the pens had 00 points not 00   ok  my numbers came from the nhl guide and record book   they made the transaction to try and build a winner around mario that is  true  but the improvement in attendance came before they started doing this coffey late in 0000 and before they even had a playoff bound team a doubling of attendance occured in 000000 from the previous year  an increase from 00 points to 00 points is not going to do that  the arrival of mario lemieux is what did it   you can give the credit to mario since he deserves it  but my point is that it wasnt mario himself but it was the expectation of things to come ie a winning team that he created by being the next great hockey superstar and before anybody jumps in and says im nitpicking and mincing words go back and read from where this thread started  it might help to think about what would go through a fans mind who suddenly found an interest in mario and the pens  was it gee mario lemieux is amazing ill go watch him play or was it gee now weve got a kick ass guy on our side ill go watch him play  i think it was the latter   similar thing happened in la   before gretzkys arrival about 00000 per game  after constant sellouts  they are still selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement since gretzkys first year there  how do you explain it  people are going to see gretzky  they certainly arent going to see a winner they havent got a winner  theyve had much better teams in their past history than they currently have yet they didnt draw as well then  i dont think this is accurate  the tickets sell but people dont go to the games  i think this thread has already been discussedseason ticket holders in la dont always use their tickets  so in effect after the kings initial success following gretzkys arrival 00 to 00 points same source and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much    whether or not the kings are a winner is debatable  i claim that since gretzkys arrival they have at the very least been competitivei also claim that mcnall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the oiler dynastybut thats another story and included only because i dont like mcnall  anyway  mcnall did do some heavy marketing around gretzky and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales etc  but as i said when the kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the forum even if the tickets were sold  i think in the case of a lemieux or gretzky the player can transcend winning as the major drawing power    for the short term imo  although i think that its inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as lemieux or gretzky simply because they make people around them better  but winning sure as hell helps    well at least we are in full agreement here  this does not make rogers point any more valid but the jets arent  so are you saying roger has ever had a valid point couldnt resist  getting a huge jump in productivity yet they are getting a huge jump in attendance  this is due to the emergence of teemu selanne they have the 00th best record in hockey it sure as hell isnt because they are winning  yes but they are doing no worse than last year  i think the same type of reasoning i applied to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at winnipeg games  its difficult to predict but do you think that if the jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels  i seriously doubt it because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without selanne  i did provide the example of rocket ismail and the toronto argonauts of the  cfldid you leave it out because you dont know much about the cfl  if  thats the case then fair enough but if it isnt the case then im curious to hear your explanation    
   the jets use the breakaway pass scheme to create a scoring sensation in order to generate interest  if teams score as many or more goals against winnipeg when selanne is on the ice as winnipeg scores when he is on the ice then i cant see how his contribution can be described as impressive    implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against winnipeg with selanne on the ice can be blamed on himroger he is a forward  winnipeg has a lousy defensive record anyway  lets put it another way  john cullens  is terrible  whats your excuse for him  that his powerplay points dont count  neither do selannes   the object of the game is not to feed selanne  it is  to win  and feeding selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way to winning  knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that feeding selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to winning   pat burns wouldnt have a goal suck like this on his team  youre worried about teemu when you have glenn anderson on your team  we dont know what selanne does best  we do know what jets management wants  and again the object of the exercise is not to allow selanne to do what he does best it is to win hockey games  what he does best is scoreso i refer you to my comment above  as it is now selanne is a grandstanding goal suck  did you see the way he parades around with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal  you would think the messiah had returned  nope didnt see it  i was too busy watching foligno jump up and down after his goal     
  i can only comment on the kings but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is alex zhitnik he came highly touted as a defensive defenseman but hes clearly much more than that great skater and hard shot though wish he were more accurate in fact he pretty much allowed the kings to trade away that huge defensive liability paul coffey kelly hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with but at best hes only a mediocre goaltender a better choice would be tomas sandstrom though not through any fault of his own but because some thugs in toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal other than that the award goes to robert lang an uninspiring czech robitaille could easily be mvp but id prefer to give it to rob blake who is quietly becoming one of the leagues premier defensemen and if the kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense it could one day mean that well let in fewer goals than hartford honorable mentions to majestic marty and warren rychel jon

  well i gotta tell ya  last nights leafs game vs the devils was a nailbitter let me tell you it was a well played game by both teams i thought but according to the don and ron it was the an offnight for the leafs and the devils  were outplaying toronto well i beg to differ  imho clark deserved to be a first star as much as gilmour did his fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the clark of old but not to take any of the credit away from gilmour  i think the leafs are playing great hockey why  well first look at their injury list which includes cullen ellet zezel macoun of course my question is thishow will the leafs fare when they are once again healthy if they are playing this well so far  second just look at their standings still second in defence moved from 00th overall to 0th over in the last month havent lost at home in last 00 games 0 game undefeated streaketc btw am i wrong or was this potvins first shutout i cant  remember him having any as of yet  well as of april 0 we see that the race for first in the norris has truly begun and it will be a very close race between chicago and toronto and the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one  coming to the stretch and still a roarin go leafs go       alfred yongjeh yim                    toronto wins the     0b mathematics actuarial science                    cup   university of waterloo canada         i like cocacola idea personally   email ayimdescarteswaterlooedu

  in article 0000apr00000000000nntpd0cxodeccom nixdorfetre eric nixdorf writes       looking at the way the divisions were realigned there are six teams each in the central norris and pacific smyth divisions while there are seven teams each in the northeast adams and atlantic patrick divisions  the thought occurs to me that inherent in the realignment is expansion of one team in the central division and one team in the pacific division although ive seen nothing published that indicates that  actually when the nhl expansion committee was formed a couple of years back before the ottawa and tampa bay expansion john zeigler stated at the time that it was the nhls expansion plan to grow to 00 teams 0 per division by the turn of the century    andrew scott                     andrewidacomhpcom hp idacom telecom division       000 0000000 ext 000  during the roman era 00 was considered old  last night during a sharks broadcast commissioner bettman was interviewed during the first intermission  he made no bones about it the expansion to 00 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that the current allotment of 00 are fully stable  this means that cities looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until one team in some location fails or looks to relocate  this is good imo  theres no sense in expanding if it only means more failing franchises are in the mold  tom galvin             galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil

  says the precedent was set by the wha in their first season  they used a red puck for exhibition games and a blue one for the regular season thankfully they abandoned it in favour of black before the next season began   one reason that the wha abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it crumbled very quickly during play  the blue dye that was used somehow affected the vulcanized rubber of the puck decreasing its cohesiveness  terry u00000uicvmuicedu

   hi  according to my always questionable newspaper theres a silver dollar being minted in canada the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the stanley cup  now i know full well what coins are used every day in canada  i can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now in fact  my question is since the loon is the only dollar coin that i know is legal tender is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value or what  is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet with no chance of it being circulated  if it is an uncirculated coin whats the current cost and whats its potential value  just curious  if no one knows ill take this to socculturecanada and reccollecting or whatever it is  thanks again    valerie hammerlsome days i have to remind him hes not  hammerlacsubuffaloedumario lemieux  herb brooks on claude acscvjhubmsccbuffaloedulemieux top scorer for the devils but  v000pwwpzubvmsccbuffaloedu  known for taking dumb penalties

     here we go again is this the same idiot who posted the gretzky trade to toronto   sheeeesh  you should have waited until we got over that one before this garbage maybe we would have believed it for half a second not     by the way i just heard from mother goose that mario lemieux was traded to winnpeg for tie domi   randy psc i know noone has heard of it its a tiny college in hicksville new hampshire plymouth state college

  when talking about hockey broadcasters lets give a moment of silence to remember the st louis blues great dan kelly many of you may have heard him in the late 00s and early 00s on cbs he used to do hockey night in canada intermissions with another recently deceased great danny gallivan of the canadiens  agreed hereill never forget dan kelly calling the playbyplay in the 00 canada cup  he was masterful  and danny gallivan will never be replaced even now when i watch hnic i remember his voicewhen i see an al macinnis or al iafrate hey whats with these guys named al who can shoot shot from the point i still think blistering blastthn had a tribute to gallivan in the issue following his death in the story they included a quote from one of the games he did  it went   it appears risebrough has pugnaciously construed that check he said and  will undoubtedly make a visitation to the box of punition  classic vintage gallivan  hes sorely missed  so heres to two of the best there was and best that ever will be   dchhabrastplistsca

   okay you hockey playing fansfinatics out there im looking over the wide  range of aluminum sticks for the first time ive been playing with pieces of lumbar that seem to weigh alot and break after a few uses so im  thinking of changing to an aluminum shaft so when i break the blade all i  have to do is change it the problem is that there is such a wide reange of models and selections out there that im not certain which to consider can any of you post some of your suggestions and experiences with the aluminum  sticks what is the difference between models what do you likedislike about them and which brands are best    ive had and still have a few aluminum sticks  i got my first when i was 00 a christian and broke the shaft halfway through the season two years  later  i bought another a canadian at the beginning of the next season  and i still have it  i also have an easton that a friend was getting rid  off after giving up the game  i find that easton blades are easier to get  but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable  watch out for  dried up bits of firewood that some stores pass off as blades  in my  experiences the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks  but ive only ever broken one aluminum shaft  i like aluminum sticks  the blades are quickly changed even on the bench  if you have to  on the downside the shaft wont break if you decide to  impale yourself on it   ciao mark s  this is between me and the vegetable    rick moranis in                                            little shop of horrors mark shoesmith shoephysicswatstaruwaterlooca

   stephen legge sleggekeanucsmuncca writes i was wtahcing right guard hockey week on tsn yesterday and they had a feature on this guy that does a lot most of the masks for nhl goalies  they talked about how they are made what they are made of and the designs that are put on them etc  actually this part was really interesting  it turns out that the mask is customfit to the goalies face  the goalie puts hisher face through a piece of wood or was it plastic with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show  hair is covered by a cap eyes are covered by a plastic wraptype material and vaseline is put on the goaltenders face  then a plaster is spread on their cheeks forehead and chin which takes about 00 minutes to dry sufficiently  when it dries it is effectively a mold of the goalies face  this is used as the basis of the mask the rest involves padding the inside hardening the exterior fitting the cage etc etc   john blue of the bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show   he exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on namely a new mask for andy moog which is a basic reworking of his current mask with the bear on it and new mask for bob essensa which was  really cool  the jets logo was on the chin and there were two fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an airbrushed background  yeah essensas mask looked really good   the best one of all was one he never talked about he just held it up it has the current leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking  black panther on the forehead  it has to be a new mask for felix potvin but he never said whose it was  actually i thought i heard him say that it was potvins for certain  i would bet money on it either wayand it did look awesome   dchhabrastplistsca

       the adams division race is certainly interesting this year  here are  important data to keep in mind in the eventuality of a tie for a given  standing position    in head to head games  quebec wins over montreal 000  boston leads against quebec 000 with two games remaining  montreal and boston are tied 000 with one game remaining                  pierre breton   aka fluide glacial  pierre for purposes of the tie breaker you only count the first three games in each city therefore quebec cannot possibly be ahead of montreal 00 and theres probably only one game that counts remaining between boston and quebec which means boston has probably already won  pete clark  rsh flyers contact

      in the smythe this one is the toughest for me to call because i have to put personal bias aside go calgary  i think a lot depends on who wins the division  winnipeg will move into third by the end of the season and the first place winner will have a clear advantage it will be a lot easier to build momentum against a team like the kings  whoever plays the kings in the first round will take the division  much as it hurts i have to pick division winner  vancouver canucks  ill have to disagree with you on this one i think vancouver will go as bure goes and if he continues on his goal scoring slump then they wont even make it out of the first round i think the kings will make it out of the first round regardless of who they play they seem to be doing pretty well even with that bad game against minnesota on saturday i think itll be either calgary or los angeles to win the smythe ie go on to the conference finals   wales conference trophy islanders and bruins will fight to the end but i think the islanders have enough steam to overtake the bruins in seven  campbell conference trophy a walk for vancouver maybe in 0 or 0 but definately not 0  stanley cup final islanders and vancouver  islanders will have nothing left by this point and will succumb fairly easily to the canucks  stanley cup champion vancouver canucks  still have to disagree with you here i think itll be pittsburg to get the hat trick in stanley cups they just look toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good   i hope you have enjoyed my predictions  i hope they are not all correct go calgary  neither do i well may the best team win it all pittsburg thats just my 00 worth     message from the terminal of carol boudreau  boudreauathenamitedu

  in rauser000000000sfuca rauserfrasersfuca writes          ten years ago the number of europeans in the nhl was roughly a quarter  of what it is now going into the 000000 season the numbers of euros on  nhl teams have escalated to the following stats    canadians 000  americans 000  europeans 000       please note that these numbers are rounded off and taken from the top  00 players on each of the 00 teams my source is the vancouver sun       heres the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl i am sick  of watching a game between an american and a canadian team lets say the  red wings and the canucks and seeing names like bure konstantinov and  borshevshky is this north america or isnt it toronto detriot quebec  and edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of euros on other  teams is getting worse as well   thats why we have expansion  to create more jobs nhl teams cant afford to import role players from europe they pick the stars but will continue to build their teams around local players        with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating the problem is clearly  only getting worse        im all for the creation of a european hockey league and let the bures  and selannes of the world play on their own continent  id love to see a european nhl division but cant see it happen for some time theres simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several crucial markets like germany italy and france while sweden and finland probably cant afford to shell out 0000 for tickets the way americancanadian fans do call it the minnesota north stars effect scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local inexpensive hockey to the nhl the national hockey league should love the idea though paneuropean tv channels such as eurosport could bring in the millions the american networks likely never will pay        i just dont want them on mine               richard j rauser        you have no idea what youre doing  rausersfuca            oh dont worry about that were professional  wni                          outlaws  we do this for a living    remember no matter where you go there you are drbanzai

    the flyers team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the spectrum sunday night and dominated the maple leafs thoroughly en route to a 00 shutout tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs from mounting any serious attack  injuries  pelle eklund is daytoday with a bruised thigh  roster moves  jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game jason was the flyers second pick in the first round 00th overall of the 0000 entry draft 00 years old 00 000 lbs in 00 games with the tricity americans he had 00 goals 00 assists and 000 pim he plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although bobby taylor said that bill dineen was planning to use him up front as well  andre faust was returned to hershey he actually left after the second period of the kings game flew to albany got the game tying goal in a bears ot win and played again for hershey sunday night  lines  fedyklindrosrecchi beranekbrindamourdineen lomakinbutsayevconroy actonbrown  galleymcgill yushkevichcronin carknerhawgood bowen  tommy soderstrom in goal  acton replaced lomakin in the 0rd period  game summary  if the flyers played like this every night theyd be in the playoffs this year the flyers hit everything that moved they created scoring chance after scoring chance they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do  jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found brindamour crashing the net on the other side a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppas body should have been a goal but puppa made a great save reading the play  garry galley gave the maple leafs 0th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked doug gilmour at 000 the flyers lowly 00st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill the maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every rebound  after the power play the flyers got a goal on an ugly play rod brindamour gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef beranek and bob rouse who were wrestling in the slot beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over puppa for a 00 flyers lead at 000  the flyers kept the pressure on and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers from building on their lead for a while eventually things settled down and defense prevailed each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were strong bowen started giving some lindroslike checks in his own corners then lindros who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the score he had foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice boards the only problem was that foligno was a little far from the boards and mike mister mcgeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 0000  the leafs couldnt get anything going on the power play as the flyers were very aggressive for a change on the kill  with time running out in the period recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to lindros as they approached the leafs blue line they were in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros tried a backhand pass to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi but then clark checked recchi off the puck macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to mcgill who had manned the point he drove it from just inside the blue line macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 00000 shots were 000 flyers in the period  the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk tripped up rod brindamour in his offensive zone during the power play the flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric gloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head we could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end as time was running out in the advantage lindros found galley with a pass across the goal mouth but puppa made the save the rebound kicked back to the right corner where recchi picked it up passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle and eric onetimed past puppa at 000 with the assist recchi moves past bobby clarkes 0000 season the second best one season total for a flyer at 000  eric moves up to 0th all time in flyers rookie scoring with 00 points  mike eastwood took down al conroy at 000 to give the flyers another chance on the power play not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with a slash at 000 not much happened on the 0 on 0 although the leafs had most of the possession the flyers smothered the leafs short power play tempers flared a little at 0000 bowen and pearson got roughing minors keith acton got a bloody face dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a hooking minor at 0000 to set up a 0 on 0 the replay showed that hawgoods stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyers smothered the leafs power play led by dimitri yushkevich bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot he made all the flyers look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stoned him  the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didnt get anything home shots were 0000 flyers  the flyers were content with the 0 goal lead in the third period and they decided that if tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a little  the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first 0 or so minutes of the period but couldnt get past puppa then the leafs got tired of lindros making road kill out of them and tempers flared 0 each for doug gilmour and lindros  unsportsmanlike conduct and 0 each for glenn anderson and mcgill roughing all at 000 terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 000 on gilmour  again the flyers smothered the leafs power play  at about the 00 minute mark dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through soderstrom the puck was rolling on its side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other seconds later rod brindamour tripped up gilmour at 0000 to give the leafs another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom stoned andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout  recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 0000 no punches thrown recchi got the initial minor krushelnyski baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors at 0000 rouse and beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 0 each for slashing to set up another 0 on 0 mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers zone as they were battling for the puck and while mcgill was down he ran his stick across mcgills face the flyers were not happy with that at all 00 al conroy paired up with 00 berehowski and started throwing punches upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and al got a standing o penalties eastwood 0 cross check  game clark carkner 00 each berehowski and conroy 0 each fighting at 0000  so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers the had no interest in stting on the lead hawgood galley and brindamour played catch until hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past puppa at 0000  that was all the fireworks tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppa did but kept the flyers off the board 00 flyers shots were 00 flyers in the 0rd probably the strongest game ive seen from the flyers since the all star break shutout number 0 for soderstrom all since 000 tied for 0nd most in the nhl but hes played fewer games than belfour 0 or the goalie i cant remember that hes tied with  next up its the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyers cannot be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end  flyers up to 00 points on the season in 00 games last year they had 00 points in 00 games 0 under 000 so they need at least 0 points in their last 0 games to improve on that only by percentage points 0 under in 00 is better than 0 under in 00  tragic number holds at 0 points with 0 games left the tragic number for 0th is 0 points i watched the rangers blow a 00 third period lead at home to lose 00 before i finished this up why 0 points instead of 0 well the flyers will win the tiebreaker if they catch them whereas the islanders win tie breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie the rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the devils the pens twice the flyers and finish up with 0 games against the caps so i guess 0th place could be the goal for the team to focus on

     well here it is nhl in the year 0000 i got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and  although i initially thought i had just been taking too many too strong  drugs now it seems the realization has really begun  you can see the  league has already started to move to this direction     the walt disney conference anaheim mighty chipmunks    franchise name to be changed after each new  la kings                      hockey movie          la flames                   weve seen some of that san jose sharks san diego bruins tijuana red wings   detroits hockey team will follow its car industry dallas stars            houston oilers texas rangers seattle canucks     the norm green conference alabama white hawks biloxi blues tampa bay lightning miami blades helsinki jets        youve heard them starting getting used to the anthem montreal quebecois sp                 there will be no canada atlanta devils orlando penquins key west islanders hartford whalers                        the whalers will never move huh palm beach capitals    now that the anahaim team is becomming real im really beginning to believe the rest of the message  im sure the future will turn you into believers  too  after 0000 the nhl will abandond icerinks  its so expensive to cool  down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is  anyway  nhl will become a roller skating hockey league  that way it can  create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the  game in their back yards            i hope im just out of my mind         there wont really be a disney team in anaheim will there         the stars arent really moving

  davebthewhoeastsuncom dave brewer writes  in yesterdays fracus between rob ray and brent hughes was it the camera angle or was ray actually punching hughes where it appeared he was punching him for those that didnt see the game  it was several inches below the belt and he punched him there quite a few times dreadful  also why did poulin get four minutes   ive been watching  playing hockey for a good long time now and ive seen players with questionable tactics but never have i seen what ray did on sunday this guy gets my all time loser award its one thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck when they are down its another thing to have a fist fight with someones balls ray should be thrown out of the league what an ahole  steve

  dvbick  writes    0 foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your     body or stick if you get 0 you are out for the game  ive never seen a game where one player has committed 0 penalties  something like this would require more attention by the referee     0 unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the     current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you     are thrown out of the game and fined    0 technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot     is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game    besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets 0 penalties  in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one  until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if heshe was in  the act of shooting when the foul ocured    this works well for several reasons first penalty shots are the most  exciting thing in hockey right so it follows that the more the better  next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can  take a commercial finally with only three penalties the network  announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall and  marv levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before  the pa announcer says it    but youre creating a scoring opportunity where there might not have been one before  i can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls but its obviously easier to score in basketball there are more opportunities  if a basketball team scores 000 points thats at least fifty chances made  the average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game and this is a total guess is probably around 00 and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 0 of them  you have some good ideas concerning the other penalties but i think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with  also later in the post you talked about how boring the nba game you attended was that play was stopped too often wouldnt your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game  matt att uva

  messier is a joke this year  bad back not withstanding  his play is the reason the rangers will be on the golf course in a couple of weeks gartner is my choice  the guy works his butt off every game  kovalev  no surprise  hes played adequately but as bad defensively  kovalev is too talented a player to play for roger nielsonroger needs players who cant think for themselves and can only skate in straight lines up and down the ice  dudley and nielson are the only two coaches bad enough in the league to take talents like mogilny and kovalev and not know how to turn them into bure and selanne  as was predicted in preseason  perhaps hell pull an alex mogilny in a couple of years and surprise us then  zubov wasnt expected to make it out of the minors this season and owing to the number of injuries has proved to be a very pleasant surprise   get muckler as coach and kovalev will look like mogilny  the trouble with the rangers is that neil smith went out and got players like messier kovalev and graves who have been schooled in taking the game to their opponent and attacking while hiring coaches who are interested in ropeadope strategies  if you want the roger nielsons of the world to be your coach you dont go out and get a mark messier who is an old dog who cant learn new tricks from a known loser and you dont waste your draft picks on players like kovalev  gerald  gerald  
  major league baseball has told the blue jays and the expos not to sign oscar linares i think that is his name  linares has not defected as i pointed out mlb requires that the player defect first  canada does not have the restrictions against cubans that the us has and other major league teams have told the canadian teams that they would be very unhappy if the expos or the blue jays would do this  what a surprise  as long as the pool of talent is not accessible to all teams mlb wont let a few teams sign it  seems perfectly reasonable to me      cubans players would not have to defect to play in canada and could play the 00 home games for the expos and blue jays without any trouble  except that mlb wont allow it which is all i ever said  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

  no no no since all the penalties fall into three classes there should only be three penalties  0 foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your    body or stick if you get 0 you are out for the game  0 unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the    current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you    are thrown out of the game and fined  0 technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot    is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game  besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets 0 penalties in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if heshe was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured  these new rule changes are great  however i think that your rules are much too complicated  how will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has  and then we would even have to remember the names of the players in order to determine who drew the foul  and of course there will have to be new subpositions like the power center who just sits in the slot until the blue of course puck comes near him and the shooting defenseman and the point defenseman  finally well be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penaltyshot takers  since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled well be able to see ulf samuellson sp and tie domi miss penalty shots like crazy             keith kellerlets go rangers lets go quakers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs  next time you go over my head ill have yours on a platter  cmdr benjamin sisko 0000

   somebody wrote id love to see a european nhl division but cant see it happen for some time theres simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several crucial markets like germany italy and france while sweden and finland probably cant afford to shell out 0000 for tickets the way americancanadian fans do call it the minnesota north stars effect scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local inexpensive hockey to the nhl the national hockey league should love the idea though paneuropean tv channels such as eurosport could bring in the millions the american networks likely never will pay  this brings up a question i asked myself no answer when it was mentionned that the nhl could expand in europe  would most of the northamericans now playing in the nhl be willing to play for a team in europe  i do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level i know i would but i am not a pro hockey player  when one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a european expansion could be achieved  remember these   lindros did not want to play in quebec for more than  reasons  nicholls  in edmonton  r courtnall wanted to be traded to la only  c lemieux said he would refuse to go to edmonton earlier this year  i know there are many noncultural reasons behind these but there is more   some american players who played for the expos complained about the french   fact and that the city was not quite like the other us cities  one   players wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could   not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in montreal  anybody knows what happened when all these us football players moved to london spain etc  for the one year of that new football league 0 years ago  i wonder what the players association thinks about going to europe  myself i would like to see some european teams but what would be  the best way to do it   marc  
  ee0iandrewcmuedu ethan z evans writes    of course penalties will have to be changed    roughingchauvanistic males being aggressive  slashingchauvanistic males venting frustration  fightingproof that males cannot cope with their feelings    no no no since all the penalties fall into three classes there should only be three penalties  0 foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your    body or stick if you get 0 you are out for the game  0 unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the    current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you    are thrown out of the game and fined  0 technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot    is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game  besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets 0 penalties in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if heshe was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured  this works well for several reasons first penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey right so it follows that the more the better next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can take a commercial finally with only three penalties the network announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall and marv levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the pa announcer says it  oh one other rule when a goal is scored 0000 times a period the play cannot resume until the pa announcer announces it this way the network can sneak in a few more commercials then once the pa announcer has told them who scored the tv announcer can tell you the viewer and even have a  chance of pronouncing his name right  seriously though i actually went to see a nba basketball game last week for the first time in my life i was amazed how boring it was the play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like freethrow shooting contests during the period of course the laker girls get to do their  routines at least 00 times during the game and not just between periods either there is a whistle every 00 seconds on average maybe less the game is 00 minutes with 0 minutes between quarters 00 and 00 and a 00 minute halftime and it still takes over 0 hours  the reason for this has to be tv there is plenty of room to throw in commercials and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening on tv basketball is fairly entertaining imho but it is better to watch it on tv than to be there if this is the road the nhl is following then it truly is a sad day  enough for now  dvb

  after watching the pengiuns all year and as many other teams as possible ive really noticed an increase in tom barassos cheap shots this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders ive also noticed that he usually gets away with it just as examples last night i noticed him elbowing scott stevens in the head which basically started the whole shoving match that got stevens scott and tocchet 0 minute minors he also kicked john mclean of course he wasnt called for that isnt kicking an automatic match penalty and 00 game suspension i think glenn anderson got one a few years ago for kicking gaetan duchesne in the chest theres no doubt in my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall hes also very good  how about that tocchet headbutt is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a nonkicking match penalty i cant remember anymore  oh the playoffs should be fun ralph   
  from anna matyas now if we could just clone chelioss personality and transplant it into all of the defensemen on the islanders capitals and devils   gerald   in other words you want to turn them all into assholes so they will spend lots of time in the penalty box and get lots of misconducts   and this comes from a chelios fan  yeah and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 00 minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the best defenseman in the league id take a whole team of chelioses if i could that way when one got a penalty the others could kill it  ralph   
  mattbhawksamsungcom matt brown writes more about the messiersamuelsson incident while this is true strictly speaking it was the rocksteady replicant who initially used his stick illegally to measure messiers ribcage there is no question in my mind from seeing the replay in slomo that ulf0000 was coming at messier with intenttohasta la vista in mind and should have been gone for that    i agree with rick that ulfs cross check wasnt illegal it was the kind  of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called slomos  sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are  besides if messier cant take the heat he should stay out of the kitchen  so staffan how is mattias timmander doing this year and any impression on markus czeriew lost my roster list on hammerby does it look like they will make it to the eliteserien for next year and then get stomped if markus goes to boston   well matt mattias timmander hasnt been playing with the modo elite league  team yet just the modo junior team so i predict he needs a few more years  here before he can join the bs i saw him play in the swedish championship  game for junior players this year and he played very well a physical game  but not the kind of rough stuff that ulfie does i suspect you would like to  have a ulf typeofplayer on the bs team too   as for mariusz czerkawski he has had a great season for hammarby in  division 0 he scored if i remember correctly 00 points this season  and then we have to keep in mind that a 00 point season in sweden is  considered very good due to the limited number of games mariusz is  djurgarden property he was just on loan to hammarby so he will play  in elitserien next season unless the bs can get him of course  i would say that mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to  watch in swedish hockey this season   staffan      staffan axelsson                  etxonssufsaericssonse      rsh contact for swedish hockey    
   well the patrick division got a little more interesting last night  the islanders lost in ot and the devils tied the pens  that means if the isles beat the devils on friday the will meet the caps in the playoffs  however i have some more comments on the islanders and hockey in general that i need to get off my chest   first of all with the islanders  backtoback lackluster performances against the whalers one may think that  the islanders are out of shape  these guys always suck wind in the 0nd period come on a little in the 0rd and run out of gas too soon  it is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost  anyway the games was pretty  wide open  the isles still have tons of trouble scoring  the whalers played  a golie in is 0st nhl start i think his name was lenarduzzi sp  his nhl  debut was the tuesday tie against the isles  like i mentioned before this  guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while until he misplayed a  mahlakov slap shot to go to ot  i say its because the isles dont shoot  correctly  has anyone else noticed this  also i think it is really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick vukota gets as much ice time as he does  this guy has about as much hockey talent as jiggs macdonald who did play hockey i think  anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties  richard pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap  and hes a defenseman  hes got to be approaching negative infinity for his plusminus  this guy gets beaten all the time  why the need for such enforcers  not only do fights slow the game down alot but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game  ill be one of the few to admit i do enjoy a  good fight once in a while but only when its called for  you know when a guy checks the goalie too hard  in other words a violation of hockey ethics might cause you to get puched  but there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 0rd and ot  i mean come on already  im sick of seeing teams pulling guys down holding guys etc just becuase the referee doesnt call it  ot and late in the 0rd should be a time for strategy not physical prowess  trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost  if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it you dont deserve to win in the first place  just my honest opinion  gary at hofstra accgsgvaxbhofstraedu accgsghofstrabitnet

  i didnt say every team must have a number of local players rather the european teams should get the chance to sign their top players before the rest of the league comes in i agree that birthplace isnt that important dusseldorfer eg of the german league average close to 00000 fans and they dont have a single germanborn forward lion milan made the european final four with fifteen canadianborn players but nationality is going to be an issue in sweden and finland i think we really need an issue preventing lindros and mario from ending up being drafted by a european team and vice versa player trades are a different matter  any player can end up anywhere after being drafted  deg has many germanborn forwards in the team in fact the majority of players are germanborn 000000 deg had 00000 average in 00000 spectator arena  my possiblenhleuropean leaguesite list switzerland   berne zurich lugano and 00 others germany       dusseldorf cologne berlin munich mannheim rosenheim sweden        stockholm gothenburg malmo gavle finland       helsinki turku tampere italy         milan france        paris chamonix ruoen norway        oslo austria       vienna villach chech         prag slovakia      bratislava russia        moscow st petersburg great britain  netherlands      petteri kortelainen

  andrew w korbut writes  anyway this game continued a trend that has sadly been taking shape for a couple of weeks now  i had hoped it was fatigue or an aberration but i cant snow myself any longer  alex mogilny must be benched as a disciplinary action and soon  his explanation for ysebaert jumping between him and lafontaine to score the winning goal yesterday  wasnt my guy ask patty about it  actually this stuff from mogilny doesnt surprise me all that much  about 0 or 0 weeks ago i read in the toronto sun a quote from alex it went something like sarcastically  yep pattys the man  hes responsible for the teams successim a  nobody around here  i was going to post it at the timei must have forgot since nobody else  was talking about him being a problem  if i heard that in the locker room id beat the shit out of him on the spot patty took responsibility in the press taking the heat off of alex  thats because lafontaine is the epitome of class and a consummate team player  yep id beat the shit out of him too  lafontaine really must be a team playermakes you wonder what the islander management was thinking my question is what the hell is muckler doing  whether he wishes to admit it or not the team is his to coach and if he cant do the job then maybe the job should be given to somebody who can    gee kinda like alexs spot on the team isnt it   drd the devils advocate            
  writes  im sorry to tell you this but unless they pull off another 0000 miracle there  is no way the habs will win this year   ever since they traded for ramage and since savard came off injury they have been playing shinny  and you cant blame roy for the 00 loss to washington when 00 players could not score one goal  i know you think i am a boston fan but all of my years have been dedicated to les habs  david degan  well it seems that the habs have been much talkedabout of late so heres my 000  these guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the damn net  watch them in the offensive zone especially on the powerplay  damphousse or lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone maybe pass to the point get it back skate some more pass it aroundbut wheres the shot answer the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands in front of the net a la neely shanahan tocchet etc etc  too bad  demers wont put dipietro or leclair on the powerplay more often  dammit even ewen would at least cause some disruptions  montreal desperately needs a power forward with some talent imo  then watch them in their own zone patrick roy is screened on everything say what you want about his performance imnsho he cannot stop what he cannot see  and montreals defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net  last night against washington roy played a great game  the first goal came on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble ive seen in a long time and he didnt have a hope in hell of stopping the shot  the second goal came on a deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway  pathetic defence  the third goal was en  no wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen   dchhabrastplistsca   
   wales conference adams division semifinal boston vs buffalo the bruins are playing some excellent hockey and with cam neely back and moog his old self again this should be a cakewalk  bruins in 0  im hoping for a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win the series  goaltending is about equal top offensive players are about equal mogilnylafontaine vs oatesjuneau but buffalo has no answer to neely not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player btw in fact hes one of my favourites even though hes a damn bruin    and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway  but i think it will go six  quebec vs montreal this one is very tough to call montreal certainly has the experience factor but quebec is more talented imho itll come down to the goalies  ill go with experience and roy canadiens in 0  agreed herebut montreal will be pushed to the limit  is it just me or does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy  go habs  final boston vs montreal will bruin domination continue in this rivalry yes moog has consistently outperformed roy in the playoffs after 0000other stuff  bruins in five  i cant predict a montreal victory because ive been watching them play for 0 weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players especially to play in the garden  last time they beat the bs 00 but boston had a clear territorial advantage the victory was roys  at the same time i cant bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so ill just say i will not be putting money on this series   patrick division semifinal  pittsburgh vs ny islanders what can i say the pens are flying high and have the most talent in the league   agreed  ny doesnt have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year  pens in five which is credit to ny  washington vs new jersey capitals in 0  agreed here too but i think it will go at least six  jersey has a decent team and washington has done poorly against the division this year  pittsburgh vs washington if the caps had bill ranford i might see an upset but don beaupre just doesnt inspire my hopes  penguins in 0  i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled  i dont think it will go six eithermaybe five  conference final pittsburgh vs boston a replay of last year the penguins are just as good as 00 months ago and the bruins are much improved but penguins in 0  if pittsburgh plays boston imo they win in likely five possibly six  they own the bruins  if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once again i wont be putting money on the seventh game  i say seven because the habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season  campbell conference norris division semifinal  chicago vs st louis or minnesota  blackhawks in 0  chicago will win but i think in at least six  chicago is not that good imo  and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties  detroit vs toronto the leafs have had an excellent season but theyve been playing playoff hockey all year  the habs under burns were the same way and always wilted in the playoffs  red wings in 0  very true  the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs  toronto might win two or three  at mlg though  wings in six maybe even seven  final chicago vs detroit  this will be a war fedorov will win it in ot red wings in 0  it will be a warpossibly the most intense playoff series of them all  and yes i think detroit will win  probert will have to come up big though  smythe division semifinals  vancouver vs winnipeg  canucks in 0  our first disagreement  canucks are playing like shit  they dont use their size at all which may explain why they get hammered 00 by a team chasing them calgarywinnipeg in six  calgary vs los angeles this would have been tough to call except for three things 0 the kings dont have a goalie 0 gary roberts will be back 0 the kings shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner paul coffey for a proven loser jimmy carson gretzky is just too weary to carry this group flames in 0  this is also tough for me to call because i havent seen the smythe enough  i dont think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a nonissue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate gretzky  la in six  final vancouver vs calgary  flames in 0  if it is these two calgary will not need six games  but i think it will be lawinnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice  coference final detroit vs calgary  red wings in 0  wow mustve been tough to go against your team  but lets see i picked ladetroit  detroit will win probably in six  stanley cup final pittsburgh vs detroit three in a row and official dynasty status for the pens or can the wings complete a dream season well the wings are better in goal not sufficiently so though imho and have better dmen however mario and the boys can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoffs though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him the pens are just too much especially since detroit will have a tougher battle to get here penguins in 0  if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i wouldnt bet against the wings  they are very strong imo and nobody knows how strong because theyve been underachieving most of the year  if forced to choose though id have to take the penguins  a side note  vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than gilmour  no way  he is a more talented pure goal scorerbut aside from the age difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team im not asking for flames either btwive spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say hes a great player  but while he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge gilmour does it all  i know a lot of gilmourbashing goes on esp from flame fans  but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill  he is easily one of the best allround players in the nhl    dchhabrastplistsca

      whats so bad about the new playoff format do you really believe teams that finish fourth in their div deserve to be in the playoffs  with the new format you have more of a chance to see more teams do you really want to see the bruins against the sabres umpteen times or would you rather see the bruins and the capitals in the secound round of playoffs  there is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just a little over a decade ago and noone showed up for the early rounds in the playoffswhereas soon after they went to the divisional setup arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds    the empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the bruins play the sabre umpteen times than see the bruins play the captials in the first round  maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case  the experiment is worthwhile with the uneven distribution of the expansion teams but i prefer the divisional  playoff  gerald  
   he was already offered 00 million for them from northlands coliseum but refused the offer i dont think he is going to sale i think he may decide to move the team to the states though where he can draw more revenue from the team   pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political office in northlands and in the business community that the oilers with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly basis they will likely have an operating loss based on normal hockey revenues and expenses  that he did this was a good thingit is better he complain early and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollarswhich would truly jeopardize the franchise  pocklingtons first option is not to sell or to move but to sell a minority share of the team to realize some of the appreciated value of the team and to get a better arena deal either in northlands or via a new building  pocklington probably isnt going to get exactly what he wantsbut ultimately he will probably get enough or will sell to someone who will probably get enough  there are a lot of risks in moving a team also  one has to remember peter pucks principleit is better to spend other peoples money than ones own if at all possible  gerald

     you might want to clarify the 00 game winning streak  that pens streak is a playoff streak tied by the chicago blackhawks who had won 00 in a row until they met the pens in the finals last year  the 00 game unbeaten so far is a regular season unbeaten streak  but hey dont take it personally  im a flyers fan and two in a row is a stretch  but with a healthy lindros recchi brindamour and tommy soderstrom theyll be there next year by the way since the flyers need defenseman what kind of trade would anybody suggest from the existing flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that  terry carkner wont be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook paper would be better defense  matt weaver properly found at ajs000psuvmpsuedu  hey at least were not                                                        the whalers

  the bottom line is the bruins are the better team this year montreal fans have been screaming for years that their beloved canadiens deserve another cup since the removal of the french canadien rule they have been screaming foul welcome to league parity something the rest of the league has had for years even if the habs do beat boston in the playoffs they wont get by the pens i do agree with you boston is the more taleneted team   the french canadian rule was an extremely short term feature when the universal draft was instituted in the sixties and only lasted for a few yearsand really didnt have any substantial effect during that period  the canadiens stanley cup achievements were earned on a level playing field  gerald

  well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while chicago sweeps stlouis that just makes it easier in the second round with all the rest they will get and tordet getting none for the conf champ they will have a hard time versus the division but that div will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the hawks again then bring pitt and sure the hawks will probably lose but its better to get that far and lose than to not go  brian   
               what makes you think so  id like to understand your reasoning   from my seat the caps dont really appear to believe that they can    defeat pittsburgh  therefore they dont  i think their spirit was    broken in last years playoffs and hasnt really recovered  i dont know    what the season series numbers were but i believe that the pens won it   i think that either the devils or the islanders will cause more problems for      what is this spirit crap  im a caps fan and hope they win  if they end up facing pittsburgh  but i dont think the caps lose to pitt because of lack  of spirit  yes the penguins won the season series against the  caps  theyve won eighteen games in a row for gods sake  did you ever think the penguins might be good and thats  why they win  i reread what i wrote and it didnt say exactly what i thought    sure the pens are a better team  theyve got size and the best skill players in the league  theyve also got the best clutch goaltending  theyre the  best team in the league  but my point was the caps have not played to their ability level vs the pens since last years choke  and thats the mental problem the one theyve had for a number of years i tried to point out  spirit mental preparedness will to win whatever you want to call it its missing when the caps play the pens  actually youre right  it wont make any difference  george

  swartzjhrosevcrosehulmanedu writes  has anyone heard what game espn is showing tonight  they said they will  show whatever game means the most playoffwise i would assume this would  be the bluestampa game or the minnesotared wings game  anyone heard for  sure      jeff swartz   its going to be the stars  wings game  
  according to the fan here in to ottawa has won the daigle e sweepstakes  they didnt mention why but san jose had more goals than the sensens so i have a hunch this is why ottawa would pick first  susan   
     it is really annoying to see all of these  predictions on the net  who really cares  who you think will win  please stop with  the predictions we all know the caps are  going to win the cup so let it go at that     in the words of doktor kultur in the ottawa citizen remember to unhook the nitrous oxide before you leave the dentist chair  0  go jets for once in the playoffs please i beg of you paul badertscher 000000000uwovaxuwoca   
    the oilers will charge to eat in the press room next year   there was an article in one of the toronto papers about this a few months agoprobably the globe and mail  any ethical journalist even a sports journalist should not accept free meals from a team in any case which was the one of the points the article was making  admittdly most sports reporting is mostly with any ethical standards  gerald  
   it is meaningless to compare one players plusminus statistic with  another players out of the context of the role and the playing time  of the players involved      its just as meaningless to compare goals assists pim and any other stat i can think of  each player is asked to take a unique role for his team  the contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the same team or different teams  and yet  awards are given and promotions received based in part on these meaningless stats  the operative words are in part  stats must be interpreted tempered with other information one has about the player      to compare jagrs and franciss plusminus is ridiculous and absurd  and comparing jagrs and franciss points is just as ridiculous and absurd but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals assists points  for selanne lindros juneau potvin and the other rookies in the league and yet  how about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game  ron

    the flyers closed out the season last night with their 0th straight victory a 00 ot winner over the hartford whalers the ot game winner came from dimitri yushkevich just his 0th of the season and his first game winner the flyers never led up until that point in the game for the whalers the loss marked an nhl record 0th ot loss this season  roster move  gord hynes was called to to play in place

the puck at the flyers blue line and nylander stripped him and took off  the recchi goal was a 0 on 0 with lindros  the bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie  on the second nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in this is the most frustrating part of the flyers defense take the body and if they get one shot and beat you fine dont give them another chance carkner galley and mcgill are all terrible about this ill bet money at least one of them was the closest flyer to the play  thats all i have my radio got bad after that and i was lucky to know who it was that scored much less how  from what i heard roussel had a very strong game after the game gene hart asked bobby taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game it was garry galley 0 for his career high point total im surprised that a former goalie wouldnt look closer at his defensive play tommy  soderstrom 0 for his team record tying 0 shutouts in only about 00 a season and mark recchi 0 for his all time high team single season scoring mark but heres the odd part he couldnt decide between lindros and recchi for number 0 if he picks recchi as 0 after he had a hard time choosing between him and lindros doesnt that make lindros 0  what you wanna know my three stars of the season well since you asked  0 eric lindros eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice the difference between the teams record with him and without him is no accident i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without recchi there is no question that this team is significantly better with eric lindros on it and i think that he will deservedly wear the c on his jersey next season  0 tommy soderstrom 0 shutouts was second in the league to only ed belfour and tommy didnt have a chris chelios booo in front of him he also didnt play a complete season due to heart problems sentimental edge here my family has a history of heart problems theres no question in my mind that tommy soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future and if roussel complains again about being number 0 look for him to be traded within 0 years  0 mark recchi again you cant argue with an alltime team high single season scoring mark there are an awful lot of teams that didnt have a single player get as many points plus mark is the only flyer to play the entire season not a tough choice  honorable mentions rod brindamour topped his single season high point total which he set last year the difference was that he wasnt on the top line this year and didnt get as much playing time then again he didnt get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either  dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman yes he made rookie mistakes but he was usually fast enough to make up for them i have a feeling that with his shot hell score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone and i suspect that hell be the teams top defenseman in years to come  garry galley was the teams point leader from defensemen again there are some things you just cant argue with and he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his wishes under doctors orders but his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution a little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year  brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total but consistency became a problem for him  a couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members  tom misnik a member of the mailing list would like to exchange email addresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer if youre interested you can send him mail at  attacrorgtmisnik  the flyers end the season 0 game below 000 in 0th place their

though they scored as many goals as they allowed 000  the 0 straight wins is the most since they won 00 in a row in 0000  i will be sending out final stats as soon as i get the issue of the hockey news that contains them since there are no more games for me to go to i have no other way of getting them  i hope youve all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as i have knowing the future that

  all these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at njd they are a very deep team with two very capable goalies and excellent forwards and defensemen  shooter in richer an all around do it all in todd chef stasnymaster of a thousand dishes power play captainstevens  take a look at the numbers or play with them and see for yourselves    yup i agree with ya i think devils can beat red wings easily so i think   all those who send in their votes should try all these diffrent teams   before voting i think islanders and quebec are much better then i had   expected    cobra                                                                             sex is not the answer sex is the                      question yes is the answer                                                                                      email cobrachopinudeledu                                                                                                                         
   jutila was a failure i think while makela and ari haanpaa had an onagainoffagain career with the islanders both players had to play in the minors of course i like our players i just dont think the names you mention could cut it as stars in the nhl even rexi in his prime was more of a good regular in new yorkedmonton than a superstar in his own right although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf   ruotsaleinen was a more than competent nhlerhis choice of where to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability  he was crucial to the oilers stanley cup victory in 0000 the one without gretzky because he made an oiler power play which was lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive  the oilers missed him more the following year than kurri and i think the oilers would have make the finals if ruotsaleinen has stayed around the following season and would have beaten pittsburgh with ruotsaleinen and a healthy messierand delayed pittsburghs dynasty by a season    gerald  
    could someone post the flyers record with and without eric lindros in the lineup   i have a guy that is trying to compare the quebecflyers trade to the   dallasminnesota trade in the nflhershel walker  i just need the stat to back up my point that eric will be one of the next  great players  thanks  john  
  i recently bought a pack of prospect hockey cards which had various players that were coming into the nhl i got this particular card of a russian named viktor kozlov it says many scouts believe he will be the 0 pick in 0000 another guy is quoted as saying hes as  good as mario lemieux anyone know who this guy is   via dlg pro v0000

   well i just read in the boston globe that while not confirming or denying anything walsh may end up with the rangers organizations as an assistant coach  keenan has talked with walsh in the past he came up to see kariya as he will be coaching him in the worlds funny i guess he got to watch the ferraro brothers as well im not sure if walsh will go but if keenan is getting 000000 and walsh even gets 000000 thats a 00 pay raise for walsh not to mention a nice career move anyone from new york hear anything about this                 pat ellis     ps  go bruins    go umaine black bears    0000       number 0                     hockey east regulars season champions                    hockey east tournament champions                    paul kariya hobey baker award winner          ncaa div 0 hockey tournament champions                       maine      ggggooooooo    bbbllluueeee  
  in 0000apr000000000000hubcapclemsonedu jwodziadliteuucp john wodziak writes  sorry roger but mr basketbal should what he really means here ie he should have said that he hopes fans in the american southeast can follow the names of the divisions the odds that these people other than those who are displaced notherners who are probably already fans is on the order of the proverbial snowballs in hell  i am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here   if  you asked  somone  who  had never heard of hockey before if la played in the smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be what  if you asked this person if la played in the west division  the naming of  divisions  after  longdead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary obfuscation  i am glad that the names are being changed for another reason  the names patrick smythe norris adams and campbell are all the names of socalled builders of the game  this is the same type of thinking that put stein in the hall of fame  this is absolute nonsense  the real builders of the game are richard morenz howe conacher orr etc  if you are going to name the divisions after people at least name the divisions after people who deserve it  yes these people deserve recognigtion as hockey greats but the old division names took into account messers patrick norris smythe and the prince who  had alot more to do with the origins of the league than people who came into an already established situation it is much easier to be an element of change  hardly  the established situation existed prior to smythe  et  al the  stanley  cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge  what our  dear  founders  did was formalize the challenge  they created a closed league an oligop olistic professional system in the interests of making money  wheth er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable  we are however stuck with their invention and  that  de bate  is  academic   the  point  to  be made however is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  smythe and his pals showed up  or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates a new situation  if you want to honor players like bobby orr than im sure you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive  defenseman  whats wrong with best defenceman period  was there  ever  a  better defenceman   was  there  ever a better player  and if you think that bruce norris contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  bobby orrs  then  in the interests of education why dont you take a poll and find out how many people know who norris was  but you dont  have to do you  no i cant for the reasons i gave above im in the same boat as jason and i grew up with the current divisonal names and learned them when i was about  00 years old and who played in what division if a 00 year old american can learn this why would it be hard for an occasional fan to pick up  on who plays in what division  so you dont feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember that  vancouver  plays in the west division  or pacific or whatever other intuitively understandable moniker is chosen  oh  now i see your point  your intention has been to alert us to the erosion of purity  ill bet you like hockey because its for the most part played by whites of european extraction   probably not in my case im sure of this what you said would be like me saying that all maple leafs fans are as biased closed minded ignorant  and of course you neatly deleted jasons  jingoistic  rant  about  the game  losing  its  canadianization   quoting me out of context does more to erode your credibility than it  does  mine   my  position  is clearly  progressive  and  is anything but biased closed minded ig norant  arrogant i will grant you  arrogant and moronic as you  just because someone a doesnt like what mr basketball is doing b voices their opinion and c likes the senerio of you going to antartica does not mean that you have the right to insult them  nice try john  but for a flame to be truly effective you have to display  at  least  enough  intelligence  to  earn  your targets respect  cordially as always  rm     roger maynard  maynardramseycslaurentianca

  does anyone out there have the shorthanded goal totals of the nhl players for this season  were trying to finish our rotisserie stats and need shg to make it complete   
   stanley cup finals toronto maple leafs    vs    montreal canadiens     the classic stanley cup final matchup also a dream come true montreal wins the stanley cup in the 0th game 0  0 in double overtime  you know after i finished laughing i thought  this would be a great final  two canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that don cherry nonsense behind them and a nailbiter finish  of course i would prefer a vancouvermontreal final with vancouver scoring the final goal  pity neither will happen  steve holland     
  a fine 00 year history came to a close tonight as the minnesota north stars  or norms stars whichever you prefer lost to the red wings by a score of 00  the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen who netted two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to play   yes its a shame that the nhl lost a fine team in one of the best hockey markets in the country  being a north stars fan it is sad to see all of the tradition of the last 00 years get thrown into oblivion at the hands of a truly crappy owner  hopefully the nhl will install an expansion franchise in the twin cities within the next five years  even if this is the case a lot has been lost in the north stars move  kea

   the subject line says it all  is it terribly difficult to get tickets  to penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  would  it be easy to find scalpers outside of the igloo selling tickets    dean money  dmoneymagnusacsohiostateedu       here is my traditional experience with tickets playoffs and otherwise at the civic arena       scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the arena  best  strategy given that you dont mind missing the anthem which is ok if be taylor decides to come back ever again   is to wait until 000 or 000 when the game is rolling the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets       playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on  whats left at 000 may be nosebleed material d e sections  others can add on their opinions as well  kevin l stamber purdue university penguins 0 devils 0  pens lead series 0 game to none

     the blues scored two powerplay goals in 00 seconds in the third period and the beat the chicago blackhawks 00 sunday afternoon at chicago stadium brendan shanahan tied the game 00 and brett hull scored the game winner 00 seconds later jeff brown and denny felsner scored the other blues goals brian noonan had the hat trick for the hawks who also had some very good goaltending from ed belfour blues goalie curtis joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the blues lead  the hawks came out strong in the first period outshooting the blues 00 and taking a 00 lead on noonans first goal right after an interference penalty on rick zombo had expired keith brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to steve larmer in the right circle larmer fired a long slap shot and noonan deflected the puck between josephs pads after the goal the blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the hawks 000 in the first period  jeff brown tied the game 00 at 000 of the second nelson emerson broke in on the left side got by craig muni and pushed the puck across the slot belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards where brown collected it and slapped it in before belfour could get back to the goal  two minutes later on a hawks power play belfour stopped rich sutter on a shorthanded breakin chris chelios picked up the puck and passed it to jeremy roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open noonan with a nice pass across the slot noonan fired it past joseph at 000 for the 00 lead  noonan completed his hat trick 000 later to increase the hawks lead to 00 stephane matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to noonan who beat stephane quintal by driving to the net joseph had no chance as noonan deflected the puck in the net  denny felsner reduced the blues deficit to 00 at 0000 after picking up the rebound of basil mcraes slap shot from the slot janney set up mcrae for the shot and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to felsner felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net the blues outshot the hawks 000 in the second period  with the blackhawks leading 00 at 000 of the third stephane matteau picked up a high sticking penalty just 00 seconds into the power play steve smith was called for slashing giving the blues a 0on0 advantage for 000  the blues didnt waste time as brendan shanahan scored just 00 seconds into the twoman advantage to tie the game 00 janney found hull in the slot and hull fired a rocket at belfour jeff brown collected the rebound and passed it to shanahan in the left circle shanahan beat belfour from a sharp angle  just 00 seconds later hull scored the game winner for the blues nelson emerson broke in on right wing carried the puck behind the net along with two hawks defensemen emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked hull in the slot and hull beat belfour to put the blues up 00  the hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes but joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the hawks from scoring he stopped troy murray point blank from just right of the crease with 000 left in the game the blues killed off a late hawks power play with rich sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line the blues held on to win the game the hawks oushot the blues 000 in

  the subject line says it all  is it terribly difficult to get tickets to penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  would it be easy to find scalpers outside of the igloo selling tickets  there are always scalpers with tickets outside the arena  you might have to pay a few bucks extra but you can always find them  look on the street under the message board or out on the street in front of the hyatt or even around gate 0  the later you buy them the less money youll pay and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face value or below if you wait until game time  might be better to pick them up earlier now though  rick

  well put jason  i am not from wisconsin but i have close relatives who live in port washington about 00 minutes north of milwaukee i visit the city regularly and i have been in the bradley four times to see the admirals play  and the ncaa hockey championships  it is a beautiful building  the pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in north america as to what will happen with the admirals if milwaukee does acquire a franchise word is the team will move to green bay and play in the brown county arena once again the admirals are an independent franchise and the people of milwaukee have been supporting them well  the games i have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 00000 to 00000 which are numbers some nhl teams ie the islanders hartford new jersey would be envious of having on some nights plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without the glamour of having an nhl club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount of hockey interest exists in the city  sincerely  martin hill rt 0 box 000b sault ste marie mi home of lssu  go lakers  ps  anybody know what the attendance figures are for the ihl and how milwaukee stacks up against other ihl cities such as atlanta phoenix san diego cleveland and cincinnati  if so please reply

  as the subject suggests the flames were not impressive this afternoon dropping a 00 decision to the la kings most of the flames neglected to show up especially in their own zone as the kings hit at least five posts the flames best line was probably skrudlandpaslawskiberube which tells how bad the flames were gary suter scored a great goal in fact all three flame goals were scored by dmen  yawney and dahlquist getting the others but also made some bonehead plays for the kings pat conacher was especially impressive   the games was very chippy as dan mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it there were highsticks crosschecks punches hits from behind fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out warren rychel from behind flames dominated the game physically but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses i dont think vernon can be blamed for any of the goals calgary went with 0 dmen as roger johansson played lw he looked lost imho  i hope king inserts chris lindbergh paul kruse or sergei makarov for wednesdays game gretzky left the game in the 0nd period with a charleyhorse no idea how serious  he didnt return  i still think the flames should win this series but they better buckle down   vlad the impaler

    i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they face them in the finals which is what all the detroit sportswriters  are predicting  although i think bryan murray is probably the best gm i have ever seen in hockey  how do you figure that  when bryan murray took over the wings they were a pretty good team that was contending for the stanley cup but looked unlikely to win it  now they are a pretty good team that is contending for the stanley cup but looks unlikely to win it  a truly great gm would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the nhl and maybe win the stanley cup  a good gm like murray can maintain the teams success but cant push them to the next level  in the history of hockey there have been several better gms than murray way too many to name  murray isnt even the best gm in the league today he fails in comparison to sinden sather savard caron fletcher and quinn in my estimation  i cant imagine how bryan murray can be the best gm anyone has ever seen in hockey unless they have seen very few gms  gregmeister

    certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team  and that is simply because there are not enough solid twoway players to go  around  who would you rather have as your checking centre  doug gilmour or doug jarvis  for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres  do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey   gretzky lemieux gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman they play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one  if they were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive abilities   when you compare gretzky et al to jarvis gainey etc you are comparing  apples and oranges  it is like me telling you that felix potvin isnt  very good because a team would be better if the had lemieux instead of him  sure lemieux is a better player but he is a different type of player  for a team to be successful they need to have all types of players this includes defensive forwards  when compared with other defensive forwards bob gainey is the greatest defensive forward ever  he is the player whos talents best suited being a defensive forward who completely dominated the game when he played  maybe if a more talented player such as gretzky had decided to waste his offensive talents and play defensively he could have been a better defensive forward but he wasnt  bob gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey  gregmeister

given a major   perhaps it was trottier  it happened behind the habs goal if i recall gainey simply didnt have his head up as he was picking up the puck   but roger what the hell does this have to do with gaineys skill as a hockey player  if probert smashes gilmours head into the boards next week will that diminish your assessment of gilmours skills   if gilmour was taken completely by surprise as gainey was then yeah i would have to say that doug wasnt playing technically smart  hockey  in any case to claim as greg did that gainey never made  a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous   later on in your posting you make reference to putting words into other peoples mouthsi would suggest that your last paragraph can only be interpreted in one waynamely that i along with greg claim that gainey never made a technical mistake  if you actually read what ive written you will find that i make no such claimsoooo if logic serves me well youre contradicting yourself   gainey was a plugger  and when the press runs out of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers  grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duffand so on   i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter   good for you  youd only be displaying your ignorance of course but to each his own   roger im not sure here but i think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinionbut hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all means go aheadthats if it makes you feel better   i think gainey would be honoured to know that youve included him   i think gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at  all     my word such vehemence against poor ol bob gainey  why does he bother you so muchhe was an effective player for his style of play   on this list  i also think you have a relatively naive view about what wins a hockey gamepluggers are an integral part of   certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team  and that is simply because there are not enough solid twoway players to go  around  who would you rather have as your checking centre  doug gilmour or doug jarvis  for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres  do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey    im really sorry roger but you have lost me completely here  why dont you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ himself in nets   now if you were to compare say for example bob gainey with guy carbonneau you would have a balanced comparison   any team  the selke is designed to acknowledge their contributioni think that most people understand that its not the nobel prizeso settle down   youre wrong again  the selke is awarded to the forward that does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger  if  gilmour does the best defensive job in the league i dont see why he  should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offensively   im wrong againhmmm lets seewhere was i wrong in the first place  im only guessing here rog but i have a feeling that youve setup a youre wrong again macro key on your machine   i agree that my use of the word plugger is simplisticbut i think you know what im getting at  i would also like to point out that gilmours potential as a selkewinner was never part of the debateare you asking me for an opinion  if so i think there are far too many other deserving players to include gilmour among the candidates   settle down  if you think that i have likened the selke to the nobel prize then i suggest that you had best settle down  and if you are going to try to put words in my mouth let me suggest that you settle  down before you bother following up on my postings    i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers  grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duffand so on demonstrates a blanket

fri 00 apr 0000 000000 gmt   discussion deleted   good for you  youd only be displaying your ignorance of course but to each his own   roger im not sure here but i think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinionbut hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all means go aheadthats if it makes you feel better   to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious  your hockey education is not my responsibility   my hockey education  what the f are you talking about  im not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement    my word such vehemence against poor ol bob gainey  why does he bother you so muchhe was an effective player for his style of play   he was just another player  to laud him as anything more i find bothersome  i hated the habs  i hated lafleur until i realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever  skate in my lifetime  why would anyone talk about gainey   i hate the habs you sound like a 00year old  this statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to argue objectively about hockey  dont give me this crap about cogent argumentsive yet to read something of yours that is cogent  you consistently argue with 0 emotion 0 huge sweeping statements   frankly you have a very unconvincing style   im not defending bob gaineyfrankly i dont care for him all that much  but your dismissal of him as something less than an effective hockey player is tiresomeit has no basis in anything  how many calders did he win i think it was four go ahead and refresh my memory  what about the conn smythe  was that a fluke  yeah not the makings of a hockey superstar i know but try to have a reason any reason to shoot him down   go  around  who would you rather have as your checking centre  doug gilmour or doug jarvis  for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres  do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey   im really sorry roger but you have lost me completely here  why dont you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ himself in nets   did he play hockey at a high level  was he any good  if not why would you bother to bring jc up  i am talking about hockey players here  if you cant follow the conversation dont follow up  as i said previously it is not my responsibility to educate you   hey cowboy  youre the expert who introduced the idiotic comparison of gainey with gretzky and lemieuxyou figure it out   now if you were to compare say for example bob gainey with guy carbonneau you would have a balanced comparison   sure  two journeymen  big deal  neither one of them is worth discussing   how many individual awards between them eighti dont remember once again please feel free to refresh my memoryand try to be as sarcastic as possible about my hockey education   im wrong againhmmm lets seewhere was i wrong in the   i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter   oh my god  did i say that  rogerwhats your point  fuhr is a goaltender goaltenders dont plugin his prime he was one of the best  sanderson was a scrapperif you stick him on you may as well include half the flyers team of the same era   first place  im only guessing here rog but i have a feeling that youve setup a youre wrong again macro key on your machine   that is an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time responding to any of your or gregs postings then i will be sure to implement that very macro   oh roger you shouldntreally  i dont deserve thisyou are far too accomodating already   i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers  grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duffand so on demonstrates a blanket disregard for these individuals as contributors to the gameso yes settle downnobody has claimed that they are hockey gods   tarasov claimed that gainey was a hockey god  and greg ate it up and that is what this thread is all about  if you didnt know  that then why are you responding   you seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into your sweeping vacuous statementthats why  if you want to debate gainey go aheadbut why bring up everybody else  how does it support your argument  do you have an argument or do you just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us     and as for blanket disregard for these individuals i can remember  leaf teams purely populated by such individuals winning four stanley cups  teams  no one ran around telling us that george armstrong was the best hockey player in the world   great  i couldnt agree more  the flyers won two cups for the same reasonsdeservedly so  so what  i dont get it  are you angry that the leafs didnt get more recognition     you seem to think these pluggers are hypedi dont agreeplain and simple  if youre last statement is some sort of compromise fair enough   you might consider developing your own style  after all imitation is  the sincerest form of flattery and i am quite sure that flattery is not  your intention   cmonit has a nice ring to itand admit it you had a good laugh   right  i had to get to the end of your posting before i realized you were  a complete joke   not a pleasant bone in your body eh rog  why are you so unhappy  not getting invited to enough parties  what   in the future if you are going to respond to my postings i would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize   roger why are you under the impression that responding to your posts is some great honour  you really should stopit sounds a little bit pathetic  frankly its about as honourable as a good fart   congenially as always    jd     james david

  as the sharks season came to a close tonight i will start a series of posts trying to revisit the players the trades the moves etc that went through for the sharks for the past season  if you are uninterested since i will have the words sharks review in the subject heading in these postings you can kill them  i will first try to evaluate how the players did  these ratings of course are subject to my own biases but i hope that i can try to be as objective as possible  i will evalute players who finished the season with the sharks andor did not play for another nhl team this season  thus then lets go to the goaltenders  0brian haywardseason00th acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradep d  it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end a career that featured sharing three jennings trophies with patrick roy in 00 00 and 00  it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade and skip the letter grading but he had simply been awful on ice this year save for a bright spot or two and even if he had been healthy he would not be any more than the 0rdstring goalie  but hayward was a classy individual who also figured in on the sharks first ever victory the 0rd game of the season last year against the calgary flames as he retires the fans will remember what a good guy he was  00jeff hackettseason 0rd acquired0000 from n y islanders in expansion draft gradec  hackett after deservedly winning the team mvp honors last season simply wasted the year  other than a few good spots 00 saves against los angeles almostshutout against tampa bay etc hackett finishing with 000 save percentage and a 000 gaa watched his status go from the teams 0 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season  he was expected early to carry the team along instead he apparently became frustrated but the an early injury that forced him to miss 00 games may have been a contributing factor but upon return he simply wasnt up to the task  he may not return next year  00wade flahertyseason 0st still eligible as rookie acquired0000 signed as undrafted free agent gradei a  it is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone thus the incomplete grade but yet in the one start that he did get against the calgary flames flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods  he started the season poorly in kansas city but finished strong prompting the blades owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp honors  the upcoming ihl playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the nhl last year he was a capable backup for arturs irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoffs picking up allstar honors along with irbe now its time for him to show that he can share the job with irbe next year because with prospects dan ryder trevor robins and scott cashman coming along if he doesnt make it next year he may not ever  00arturs irbeseason0st acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradeb  i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly established that hes a bona fide nhl goaltender perhaps a bona fide 0 goaltender  he has provided most of the little highlight footage that the sharks team had getting the teams first ever shutout against the los angeles kings on december 00 he has been fearless in and out of the net aggressively playing the puck and making passes reminding people of a young ron hextall except of course the goonism  yet he still needs to develop more consistency which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him but if the sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season irbes the key as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 00 times in 00 starts   go calgary flames  al macinnis for norris  gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in edmonton  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu recsporthockey contact for the san jose sharks

markus naslund made a drop pass at the finnish  blue line popovic picked it up and advanced towards the finnish goal and  shot a nice hard wrist shot in ketterers top corner ville sirens slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 00 and juha riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over aslin 00 after the first period  the finns started the second period with really good pressure korpisalo  made it 00 with another goal from close range high over aslin then  during the finnish pressure sweden turned the game around in 000  mikael renberg worked hard behind the finnish goal and passed the puck to  jan larsson in front who backhanded the puck low 00 rundqvist entered  the finnish zone and passed to ahlund and the finnish defense let ahlund   skate in and take a shot that ketterer dropped into the goal 00  next roger hansson behind the goal sent the puck back to the blue line  where roger akerstrom took a slap shot and ketterer didnt see the puck since  there was traffic in front 00  third period started with a nice goal by stefan the shadow nilsson stefan  and patrik juhlin entered the finnish zone patrik passed the puck back to  stefan who alone with ketterer made no mistake 00  then keijo sailynoja show started he reduce and equalized the lead in only  00 seconds first he scored the 00 goal and after that he came in alone   with aslin but was tripped by aslin to get a penalty shot sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot  the swedes seemed to head for a win when mikael renberg scored the 00 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination renberg waited in the slot  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side ahlund passed the puck  and renberg took a turnaround shot low in ketterers goals far side  but jari korpisalo had other plans as he only 00 seconds later scored the  games final goal to make it 00 korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that maybe aslin should have saved   all in all a decent game where the defense wasnt the best  both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations   renberg and rundqvist plays well together in the swedish team larsson  nilssonjuhlin best line overall again it seems to be a working wc line  stillman good on defense  some players

  in tervio00katkhelsinkifi terviokatkhelsinkifi writes      now what if the two teams were merged this has been proposed in tampere   with ilves  lynx and tappara  axe  the fans wouldnt take it   they rather see their teams out of the playoffs most of the time or even   relegated than merged  its not that difficult to understand its just   like here in helsinki  you grow up being either a jokerit or hifk fan  the other team is the last team in the world you would support  im not   talking about hate but about extremely deeply rooted rivalry  deeply rooted rivalry ahem jokerit have been around since 0000 and joined the top flight only in the early 00s helsingfors ifk have been around since 0000 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 0000s so i think youre exagerating here      however its been proved that both fan groups can cheer the same team   thats the finnish national team  maybe thats how you could set up a   huge franchise in finland  no one has ever said that the team must be   called after one city or play all its games on one arena  just one team   finland and team sweden in the nhl just wouldnt make any sense  we have   way more talent than 000th of the total of north american talent  after a   couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the   nordic  presuming that our teams would have the advantage in  drafting   local talent as prooposed  thats a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the canadian  american olympic teams have been    and theyve had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice the 0000 olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team canada had eric lindros sean burke joe juneau and chris kontos another four or five have been deep subs in the nhl as for the yanks keith tkachuk scott lachance bret hedican shawn  mceachern steve heintze ted donato joe sacco and bill guerin have been  0rd0th line players in the nhl while robb stauber has done well for the  kings in goal nothing more in fact im sure that an allstar team assembled from the best finnish league teams would do no better in the nhl than hartford  or tampa bay currently are doing  but what happens if all topclass finnish  swedish players gradually end up with helsinki  stockholm as the north americanbased ones gradually retire and no canadianamerican team is allowed to draft new players from scandinavia  here is what the hockey news scouts think of our nhlbased players  0000superstar 0000star 0000nhl regular 0000nhl regular  000role player  finland

los angeles jari kurri and new yorks tikkanen are right up there with any fiveman unit pittsburgh  co have but i have my doubts about the homebased finnish players  the national team did well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of markus ketterer the goalie 00 or the players listed above and luck theres presumably a lot of decent players in finland that wouldnt be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players however my guess would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a 000 team in the nhl  sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in north america their points total 00 players is 000  seven more than ottawas 00 top players combined if we estimate there are six more nhl regulars back home in  sweden an allswedish team would assemble about 000000 skill points deducting some points from pittsburgh ny rangers and other teams that rely on swedish players the swedish team would finish in sixth place  about as high as boston vancouver calgary and montreal on paper so the dynasty talk isnt completely unfounded here an allfinnishallswedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time wont have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably play the wideopen european variant of hockey rather than have to learn the north american checking game however if free agency becomes a factor the top  scandinavian players still might end up playing for largemarket teams after a  couple of years the same way edmontons dynasty crumbled in the late 00s  some fringe players likely will be drafted by other nhl teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all id settle for a  compromise prohibit all european teams from signing a north american during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players after this  the amateur draft should be open to anyone       j o o   j o o   j o k e r i t          finland

   a fine 00 year history came to a close tonight as the minnesota north stars  or norms stars whichever you prefer lost to the red wings by a score of 00  the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen who netted two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to play  tonight on the air on the stars tv telecast announcer al shaver the voice of the north stars stated basically that he will not follow the team to  dallas  shaver when asked by his son who was doing the broadcast with him what will you do now responded first im going to get me a new pair of slippers  then im going to sit in my easy chair and watch the world go by  thank you north stars and thank you al shaver for 00 years of minnesota memories  joel alvstad    
   i saw yesterday on tv a game between team sweden and team finland most of us might know that it was played in stockholm and the result was 00 for the home team thats nothing very special but i was very surprised of saku koivu i must admit that he surprised me  already in the finnish playoffs and now on team finland  saku koivu is a light weight player if we consider his size according to my stats he is only 000cm and 00kgs and he is only 00 000000 but he is a real twoway player skates well can score gives nice passes does even bodycheckings he is really something to watch in the wc   the size isnt always everything maybe we remember harlamov and they say that saku is still growing up 0cm during last year  saku isnt that small any longer i guess i heard he is 000cm tall at the moment and will still grow 00cm  petteri kortelainen   
   in c0h0wr0j0polarisutufi frantipolarisutufi writes   not too low perhaps but surely not as high as that of an european nhl division the finnish team for example would contain all players currently   on the national team plus a topclass foreigner or two they would be in an entirely different league than tps or jokerit both of whom have perhaps a dozen players of international class  if even that why settle for a minor league when you could have the best  how many players of international class an average nhl team has 000 top players just play more in smaller rinks is the quality of european hockey really poor then recent years only few northamerican usually good farm  players players have got place in finnish league or elitserien while most  have been shipped back   petteri kortelainen

  the new name is florida panthers   the panther is an endangered species mostly located in the everglades a couple of years ago there were license plates made with panthers on them part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund  the name of the new president of the panthers should be announced today  as of yesterdays paper huizengas new hockey team will take the ice at the miami arena this fall  the team has a guaranteed twoyear lease with the arena with four oneyear options that could run through 0000  its not our choice james blosser a lawyer and huizenga aid said about ruling out the arena as a long term option  the nhl told us we  cant stay there  its not economically feasible  one reason is because the miami heat basketball team controls skybox and advertising revenue at the arena reducing the hockey teams profit potential  the hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from broward dade  and palm beach counties  a leading site is vacant land near joe robbie stadium where residents 00 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena ending an eightyear battle of wills  compliments of the newssunsentinel  jim g  fitzsanchezcastranova

  so whats the deal with bill wirtz apparently the blackhawks  st louis game was a standing room only sell out as usual but the hawks reported the attendace as 00000 gee i wonder if wirtz is planning to use this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of tv what a schmuck  in other tv news the penguins announced yesterday that they will have 0 fewer broadcast tv games and will have 00 games on some sort of subscription  payperview system yuck  ralph

      it was nice to see espn show game 0 between the wings and leafs since  the cubs and astros got rained out instead of showing another baseball  game they decided on the stanley cup playoffs a classy move by espn  what did you leave the room each of the 000 or so times they said that there were no other night baseball games every break they took back at the studio mentioned it followed by sowere gonna show you hockey instead my wife and i are hoping for rain at every baseball game they have a feed for tommorrow night  point is be glad they showed hockey but if baseball was available anywhere else you can bet you wouldve watched baseball last night  pete clark  
  detroit april 00  in a development that shocked most knowledgable observers the detroit redwings scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en route to a 00 win over the best team in the nhl the toronto maple leafs   the leafs could not be faulted as they completely dominated the inferior detroit squad and clearly deserved to win only the biased officiating of andy van hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior  visiting side prevented an allout massacre of the wings by the leagues best  team              alan  ps this is sweet roger so sweet i look forward to the next installment on wednesday night i trust you do too   
   according to the fan here in to ottawa has won the daigle e  sweepstakes  they didnt mention why but san jose had more goals  than the sensens so i have a hunch this is why ottawa would pick  first  if im not mistaken san jose had more wins than ottawa first tiebreaker in the nhl is always most wins  alan

   and now i interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you  another message sponsored by the department of really mundane statistics  i passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through a filter to average out games goals assists points and penalty minutes for the mythical average nhl pro who played in the league this season why because its monday and i didnt feel like writing any real code  anyway after i wiped out the 00odd goalies in the list i came up with  nhl average00 gp      00 g      00 a      00 pts      00 pim  then i passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories  marty mcinnis nyi00 gp 0 00 g 0 00 a 0 00 pts 0 00 pim 00 igor kravchuk edm00 gp 0 00 g 0 00 a 00 00 pts 0 00 pim 00  these two are close in games goals assists and points but are too far off in pim this leaves as the most average player in the nhl  bobby carpenter was00 gp 00 00 g 0 00 a 00 00 pts 0 00 pim 0  what an honor  i also passed the list through with the goalies still included kravchuk and carpenter were still in the top three but rob dimaio came flying up from  behind to take the title  nhl average00 gp      00 g      00 a      00 pts      00 pim igor kravchuk edm     00 gp 0 00 g 0 00 a 0 00 pts 0 00 pim 00 bobby carpenter was   00 gp 00 00 g 00 00 a 0 00 pts 0 00 pim 0 rob dimaio tb00 gp 0 0 g 0 00 a 00 00 pts 00 00 pim 0   its all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it  sg      and now back to our regularly scheduled programming  
     charlie betz cbetzromuluscraycom writes  after reading some of the reports of possible nhl moves to milwaukee or that  milwaukee should have an nhl team i thought id pass along a story i heard  recently  this is second hand so i dont know how true it is but i have  no reason to doubt it either    bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge  hockey team  the owner of the admirals sorry i cant remember his name  either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the  bradley center  lloyd pettit     supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise but   turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of 00 million was too  high    like i said i dont know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if  its true dont look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon  the admirals  arent going to be forced out of the building and you wont see an nhl club  and a minor league club in the same building especially since the nbas  milwaukee bucks play there as well  yes it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the nhl for 00m but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much  less than that he felt that no one would pay 00m for an expansion team and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that but the market fooled him and 0 teams have been created for 00m apiece in the last three years and even the existing teams cant be moved for less than  00m and i doubt that he could get one for that little  pettit gambled and lost now hell have to pay more  sg

    gerald olchowy golchowyalchemychemutorontoca writes  podein is an interesting casebecause he was eligible to  play in cape breton in the ahl playoffs like kovalev zubov  and anderssonobviously sather and pocklington are not  the total scrooges everyone makes them out to becertainly  in this case theyve massively outclassed paramount and the  new york rangers  what is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus wc i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev zubov and andersson for binghamton but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play for springfield while nylander wanted to play for sweden the whalers allowed the nhl to decide and the nhl chose the wcs how does this differ from the rangers and oilers did the whalers have to go through the league or could they have forced nylander to play in springfield  sg

  the san francisco bay area media is reporting tonight that the detroit red wings beat the toronto maple leafs 00  can someone who is not part of the media conspiracy against the leafs tell me how the game really went i am expecting a 00 win for the leafs shutout for potvin hat trick for andreychuk and a goal and 0 assists for gilmour  if the leafs really lost how many penalties did whichever biased ref was at the game have to call against the leafs to let the red wings win  thank you very much  roland dreier                                        dreiermathberkeleyedu   sorry to disappoint you but the red wings earned the victoryeasily  i watched most of the game on espn as soon as i realized that they were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second the maple leafs were flat  very flat  meanwhile the red wings were skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game  i didnt detect any bad penalty calls van hellemond did his usual good job toronto looked like how i expected them to for their first playoff game in a few years  nervous  for the leafs sake i hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies for game 0  if game 0 is indicative of the series its gonna go quick  tom galvin       galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil

the far corner where  fleury knocked rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards drawing  a 0minute major and a game misconduct at the 000 mark  unfortunately the  kings squandered the 0 minute power play when granato at 000 and watters at  000 took penalties    00 the flames closed to within 0 at the 000 mark  macinnis at the near  point passed to yawney at the far point  he took a few strides towards the net wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of hrudey  the play started on another faceoff that the kings lost  timeout  la  00 macinnis took a penalty at 000 and the kings converted on the power play to seal the victory  sandstrom skating down the far wing in the flames zone  cut towards the back of the net  just as he crossed the goal line he passed  the puck into the low slot on the far side to carson who shot off the pass  beating vernon on the ice stick side  at the 0000 mark skrudland went off for slashing and stern went crazy as he went after shuchuk  stern wound up with a double minor for roughing a single minor for cross checking and a 00 minute misconduct and he took the flames right out of the game  on the plus side  the kings for the most part played very disciplined hockey as they let calgary retaliate  the kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing  on the minus side  the kings lost almost every faceoff  this must improve or the flames will surely get that power play back on track  notes  the kings recalled guy leveque brandy semchuk and jim thomson from phoenix  wayne gretzkys 0st period assist was his 000th career playoff point  the kings entered the game 00th in the league in shots per game against giving the opposing team an average of 000 shots per game  flames goaltender mike

   i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they face them in the finals which is what all the detroit sportswriters  are predicting  although i think bryan murray is probably the best gm i have ever seen in hockey im not as impressed with his abilities as a bench coach or in general as a motivator  with the amount of talent he has on this team he should have blown away everyone in the norris  there is not another team in the norris maybe even in the campbell conference that can hold a candle to detroit on paper in terms of pure talent  but some guys have not been pulling their weight at times this year  scotty bowman on the other hand who has won i think correct me if im wrong nine 0 stanley cups is an outstanding coach and i think he could outcoach murray if they faced each other     bryan murray has done very little as gmyzerman fedorov cheveldae chaisson the whole russian strategy was a product of the previous gmmurray has made a couple of decent tradesthats about it that would hardly rank him as the best gm  wasnt primeau murrays first decision as gm  gerald

  i think that jack ferreiras firing eventually led to kingstons firing  you mention consistency of vision  i think the sharks lost that with the loss of ferreira  there has never been a 0 headed gm that has ever worked  you need one person making the personnel decisions at the top not management by committee  the conventional wisdom from around the league is that ferreira would have made the moves that would have fielded a better product on the ice  how exactly would ferreira accomplished this  the threeheaded gmship has taken a lot of heat but nobodys explained how things would have been any different had ferreira still been there  would ferreira have made more trades  who would have he had traded  would he have made fewer trades who should not have been traded  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

   matthew rush writes  is there an award for best backup behind a hockey great underneath all the hype about lemieux stevens jagr ulf etc ron francis has quietly put together a 000 point season 00 goals and 00 assists in 00 games  that was probably the best acquisition the penguins have made since getting lemieux apologies to rick tocchet who has had a hell of a year himself  the pens got just the right person at just the right time when they got francis before the playoffs two years ago to backup mario  who was the secondline center before they got francis  i remember randy gilhen who really plays tough an ace in the faceoff circle but nobody with all the skills francis has scoring passing winning faceoffs and putting 000 into every game every night  just wanted to glow a little  i know what you mean  i glow everytime ronnies out on the ice in fact one of the neatest things about seeing the pens in person is that i can key in on him instead of watching what id probably be seeing on tv  he does so many subtle things behind the play  he said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing twoway hockey that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart  he was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in pittsburgh to the team whose forwards for the most part couldnt and wouldnt play a lick of defense  its really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the pens  you mention rick tocchet and he has certainly helped and even ol kjell has been steady  but looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the lineup permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it wouldnt matter  if i had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 0 tom barrasso 0 ron francis 0 larry murphy  id love to put francis first but i do think the only thing that could really damage the pens right now would be to lose barrasso  mom

  aargh  paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the nhl he called a total of 0 penalties on the habs and one on the nordiques the nords penalty came in ot  stewart being an exnordique himself was looking to call penalties on the habs while letting the nords get away with murderwe was robbed  no  patrick roy is the reason the game was lost and ron hextall is the reason quebec won  everybody said it would come down to goaltending that goaltending was the key etc etc  well the key doesnt quite fit if youre montreal  the dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call but lets face it he literally left his feet to throw an elbow  blaming stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow  he even saw the whole shot dammit  besides stewart evened things up a bit by calling a quebec penalty in ot  montreal played a solid game although they still dont know how to clear traffic in front of the net the loss of schneider will hurt even more  normally i would say that any team that blows a 0goal lead with less than  five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time in a playoff game  especially needs to be smacked upside their collective heads  but i dont think this was a team loss although keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first quebec goal  roy is paid big money to  play  he looked like a player in an industrial league on sakics shot  demers should start racicot in the next game  if not that he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or twoand maybe this article if possible  patrick roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal he was shaky and on his knees for the rest of the night  the winning goal shouldnt have gone in  i didnt think the wraparound was as bad as the second goal  i also didnt think scott young should have gotten around the defender cant remember who in the first place  but you are correct it shouldnt have gone in regardless  oh well at least the bruins lost in ot also ha ha  yep  moog looked bad on mogilnys goal with five seconds left in the second imo  how about neely though   holy shit what a player  speaking of great players manohman can quebec skate  i havent seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time  watching them break out of their zone especially sundin is a treat to watch  they remind me of the red  army    but i still hate the team  on the rest of the games  didnt st louis winning goal come on a powerplay  penalties will cost chicago dearly especially against detroit  same goes for calgary very very undisciplined  when marty mcsorely is waving guys to the bench to avoid fights you know somethings up  new jersey was overmatched terreris heroics notwithstanding  mario is unbelievable and jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs  but i  hate that team anyway    dchhabrastplistsca pissedoff habs fan     
   well its not that bad but i am still pretty pissed of at the local abc coverage they cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing  stuff deleted  ok heres the solution to your problem  move to canada  yesterday i was able to watch four gamesthe njpitt at 000 on abc lacal at 000 cbc  buffbos at 000 tsn and fox and monque at 000 cbc  i think that if each series goes its max i could be watching hockey playoffs for 00some odd consecutive nights i havent counted so thats a pure guess  i have two tvs in my house and i set them up sidebyside to watch monque and keep an eye on bosbuff at the same time  i did the same for the two afternoon games  btw those abc commentaters were great  i was quite impressed they seemed to know that their audience wasnt likely to be wellschooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job  they were quite impartial also imo    dchhabrastplistsca not suffering from a shortage of hockey here  
  evan pritchard writes  i think that you are incorrect roger  patrick smythe and adams all played or coached in the league before becoming front office types  hence they did help build the league although they were not great players themselves    punch imlachs contributions as a coach and gm were far greater than those of the above combined  should we name a division or trophy after him  owner vs player contributions deleted are we going to honour those who contributed to the leagues evolution or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the  sport itself   stuff deleted  the money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on and that is it is the players that are what make the game great and not the people who put them on the ice    as i recall the author of the original article that started the thread claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons  roger on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a jingoistic rant but you also supported the namechanging on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent fwiw i do not think the flaming was warranted nor do i  think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all  just an  observation  however that aside the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it making it easier for the casual fan or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour  imo the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports  in addition i do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey so its a pointless exercise anyway  if the current names are inappropriate then that is a separate issue not  central to the original article  something to consider additionally is whether or not players like orr who contributed to the glory of the sport would have been able to do so without an organized professional league to play in  in this case honouring builders of the league as opposed to builders of the sport becomes a chickenandegg type question although it was the chicken  exactly true  naming divisions and trophies after smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put stein in the hall of fame  i have always thought that this was nonsense  dunno if the stein comparison is justifiable since it doesnt look as though his unanimous acceptance to the hall will hold up    dchhabrastplistsca  
   on all replays joe murphys goal shouldnt have counted   the game would have ended in 00 tie   i thought the red light went onthus in the review the presumption would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the netfrom the replays i say even from the rear the evidence wasnt conclusive that the puck was in or outin my opinion  i was under the impression that the objective is to find conclusive evidence that the puck did cross the line  and the replays i saw showed  fairly conclusively that the puck did not cross the goal line at any time anyway  somebody screwed up     dchhabrastplistsca

  collingannarborappliconslbcom michael collingridge writes    and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded   resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other   team captain trivia would be appreciated    luc robitaille was captain of the kings the first third of the season until the great one came back from his disc injury it was kind of awkward but melrose appointed anointed tgo as captain immediately upon his return after which he did not score a goal for something like 00 games  i think luc should have remained captain all season  dvb  
   i was skeptical before the game but was pleasantly surprised at the coverage  i was particularly impressed by the close range camera coverage of work in the corners and behind the play without losing a beat getting back to the puck  thorne is good and ive always been a fan of clement but i miss mike emrick  my boyfriend who is not a hockey fan even looked up at one point and said these guys are pretty good announcers  this is the same guy who said that rick tocchet looks like charles bronson  mom    i have one complaint for the cameramen doing the jerseypitt series  show the shots not the hits  on more than one occassion the camera zoomed in on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot  they panned back to show the rebound  maybe moms camera people were a little more  experienced    joseph stiehm       
  not to mention mr francis is an incredibly nice person  over christmas break a friend of mine had a little xmas gathering  the two of us drove to rons house  while i stayed in the car out of shyness my friend went to the door and rang the bell  ron answered and my friend introduced himself  he then proceeded to invite francis to the party  ron declined because he had to watch his daughter  he then reached out and shook my friends hand  i know this isnt rsb but i dont think barry bonds would be this polite in this situation  george  
  apparently part 0 defensemen numbered 0 through 00 was lost when i posted it to make things worse i lost my own copy  i have asked on the sharks mailing list on which it did get out to see if someone can mail me a copy back  if someone responds i will repost it when i get it otherwise i will rewrite it in a day or two and post it  sorry about that  0larry depalmaseason0rd acquired0000 free agent from minnesota gradei cd  no netterfan watching the sharks including me knows where depalma was at the end of the season the sharks appeared to still have his rights but he wasnt in san jose he wasnt in kansas city and his name hasnt appeared on the waiver wire  and that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for depalma  after being called up october 00 against the tampa bay lightning depalma had an excellent week scoring 0 points in 0 games while playing good defense  unfortunately the 00yearold depalma then disappeared the rest of the way getting just 0 more points in 00 more games and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice  he then was sent down to kansas city walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of shark bytes as the mailing list is now known to sharks officials faithful and neither the sharks nor we miss him  00johan garpenlovseason 0rd acquired0000 trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and 0th round pick in 00 entry draft from vancouver gradeaa  after an early slump garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way finishing with 00 points in 00 games second highest total on the team as he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau  kisio got most of the credit but garpenlov finishing second in the mvp voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders getting a clubhigh 00 power play goals  contrary to his previous rep garpenlov also showed that despite his small size 0 00 000 lbs he was willing to throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet  he also still needs to work on his defense although he improved tremendously throughout the season and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season  he will be a major key to the offense next year  00david bruceseason 0th acquired0000 from st louis in expansion draft gradei   after a banner 0000 when he led the team in powerplay goals 00 and was third in total scoring 00 points in 00 games bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury which kept him out of the lineup for all by 00 games this season  of course it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury but the 00yearold bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the sharks first season and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well  the injury appears serious which is a shame because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead his future with the sharks next season appears clouded  00mark pedersonseason0rd acquired0000 trade with philadelphia for clw dave snuggerud gradei b  it is difficult for me to understand the flyers decision to unload pederson after a very good offensive season last season 00 points in 00 games but after riding the pine early in the season pederson was summarily sent to the sharks in exchange of the defensiveminded snuggerud and he finished with 00 games combined with the flyers and the sharks  he was also limited by injuries this season and this limited his production 00 points  but when healthy pederson appears impressive with a good scoring touch good size and the willingness to throw it around although hes not considered a physical forward and good speed  he also does not appear to be a liability on defense but the sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much exactly pederson can do  00john carterseason 0th acquired0000 free agent from boston gradei bb  carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team and the hard work worked wonders as at times he looked great on ice  however although he did look great at times the fact that he received just 00 points in 00 games for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do and the sharks confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about 00 games left in the season  carter who will turn 00 on may 0 always hussled but as a result was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but he was generally a credit on the defensive end but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity and he did not impress offensively although he was one of the best sharks at drawing penalties  he is very unlikely to be back next season  00jeanfrancois quintinseason 0st acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradei bb  i dont understand why the sharks didnt let quintin play any more than the 00 games he played this season  he was generally hardworking and creating opportunities offensively and appeared at age 00 ready for regular nhl duty at least for a team like the sharks finishing with 0 points in those 00 games while not being a defensive liability  shoulder injury in training camp before the 0000 season limited quintin the teams leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two to just 00 games with the sharks and the blades that season but he looked impressive  he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season  00mark beaufaitseason 0st acquired0nd round pick in 0000 supplemental draft gradei   after a allstar season at kansas city beaufait got a cup of coffey with the sharks late in the season when the blades knocked down a playoff spot and the sharks decimated with injuries playing 0 games and scoring a goal for his only nhl point thus far  despite small size 0 0 000 lbs beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary and looked pretty good at times although its too early to judge him based on 0 nhl games in which he played mostly left wing away from his center position at northern michigan and kansas city  00jaroslav otevrelseason 0st acquired0th round pick in 0000 entry draft gradei   like beaufait otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea 0 games midway through the season  he was generally very much of a defensive liability and did not show much offensively either although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 0 games  he may need another season to work on his defense but once his defense is acceptable he should be ready  00michel picardseason 0st acquired0000 trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau gradei bc  the 00yearold picard although he perennially tore up the minors seems to be close to being out of chances for some reason after being acquired by the sharks but failing to impress the management in 00 games scoring 0 goals for his only points and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city he was not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors he has failed thus far to score in the nhl although he has been given limited opportunities  he may be the sharks bait in the expansion draft  00dody woodseason 0st acquired0rd round pick in 0000 entry draft gradei dd although perhaps i shouldnt give a grade at all  i have been accused of knocking on wood too much   then it is probably no surprise to you that i am thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far although 00 games is a small example  he was generally a nonfactor on offense was not particularly good defensively and took too many silly penalties losing many fights in the process and gathering 00 penalty minutes in those 00 games projecting to to 000 in an 00game season  hes not ready and needs at least another season at kc where he can work on his fighting skills if nothing else  his relatively small size 0 00 000 lbs does not give much possibility that he can survive at this stage as an enforcer   go calgary flames  al macinnis for norris  gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in

  i finally got it back with great thanks to mark spiegel for saving and sending it    0rob zettlerseason0th acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradecc  zettler gave the sharks every bit hes got this year unfortunately this still wasnt enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler if that  he works hard for sure but is no better than average on defense and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times while being basically an offensive zero 0 goal and 0 assists in 00 games  he would be hardpressed to make the team next year  0david williamsseason 0nd acquired0000 free agent from new jersey gradecc  imo williams was the most valuable defenseman for the sharks in 0000 playing a combination of good offense 0 goals and 00 assists in 00 games and good defense  but he playing the first part of this season in kansas city was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it then appears that 0000 was a fluke  although he improved towards the end of the season he was prone to being out of position defensively and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the teams leading scorer among defensemen last year  he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year  0jayson moreseason 0nd acquired0000 from montreal in expansion draft gradeb  after being touted as the teams top defensive prospects in training camp before 0000 more had a rather disappointing 0000 as he was not particularly good defensively and had just 00 points in 00 games  he then proceeded to improve his game massively this season becoming the teams most reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional but only occasional offensive flash offensively he was even more disappointing than last year 00 points in 00 games but his defense improved tremendously  he is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman  0neil wilkinsonseason 0th acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradeb  wilkinson was probably the teams top defensive defenseman in 0000  however partially because of injuries he was not the same this year as he missed 00 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries and seemed to be slowed even when playing  he then had often to be saved by his defensive partners that is if they are there at all  but he also had some solid games and if he can be complete healthy he can still be a force  0sandis ozolinshseason 0st acquired0000 0nd round pick in entry draft gradei a  at the time of his injury december 00 against the philadelphia flyers ozolinsh was well on track to be imo the teams mvp  a serious knee injury in that game though forced him to miss the rest of the season 00 games but he still finished as the teams top scorer among defensemen 00 points which of course tells more about the lack of offense the sharks had from their defensemen but it also tells of ozolinshs abilities  at the time he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still susceptible to socalled rookie mistakes but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team rookie or veteran  if he can come back from his injuries he is ready to be a star  00doug zmolekseason 0st acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradeb  zmolek had basically a solid and durable year being one of the only two sharks to play in all 00 games of the season  he was solid on defense but after being billed as an offensive defenseman he didnt show it 00 points he was also prone to penalties and his 000 penalty minutes was second on the team however that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents and he was at his best when playing physically  but to become a fixture in this league he needs to improve both offensively and defensively and cut down on the number of powerplays he gives to opponents   go calgary flames  al macinnis for norris  gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in edmonton  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu recsporthockey contact for the san jose sharks      
   i forgot to ask is this the highest points total francis has had in a season  has he ever had a 000 point season before either with the pens or the whalers   francis got 000 in 0000 his last full season with hartford  in agreement with your previous post i think francis is a tremendous and generally underrated complete player  i would love to have him here in a capitals uniform where he would certainly be the 0 center even though pivonka is also a very good complete player who is generally underrated francis impresses me in many ways as an ethical dale hunter  tons of heart and cando attitude with a lot of different skills but none of the cheap shots and few penalty minutes  not to mention nearly always coming through when its important

  golchowyalchemychemutorontoca gerald olchowy writes  bryan murray has done very little as gmyzerman fedorov cheveldae chaisson the whole russian strategy was a product of the previous gmmurray has made a couple of decent tradesthats about it that would hardly rank him as the best gm  there are many teams in the nhl who have taken a liking to russian players the whole russian strategy is not specific to detroit or to devellano who was gm before murray  what the previous gm also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams most notably in my memory murray craven who had a few very good years with philly after leaving here  also its not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team but the quality of them  trading adam oates for bernie federko was just plain stupid even if federko used to be a  great player at one time  most of murrays trades have worked significantly to the wings advantage with those that didnt being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved such as troy crowder who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered   devallano went earlier and more extensively to the russian strategy than anyone elseand was the first gm to waste high draft choices on young russiansdevallano would still be gm but he succombed to demers pleading to make the oatesfederko et al tradewhich is the deal that sealed his fate  murray has made some decent tradesno doubtbut these are more due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on his partwashington was too cheap to pay ciccarelli so they essentially gave him awayand carson was really a big anchor to the team and he was able to sucker a rookie gm to give him paul coffey for deadweight  if detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short then he will have wasted an opportunity because manson was available and he was unable to pull the trigger  it is his judgement that he has enough with what hes gotyzerman doesnt have that many more years in his prime  gerald  
   gerald murray wasnt responsible for primeau although im not ready to admit thats a horrible pick  they hired him after the draft which has never made sense to me  his first pick was lapointe   i dont think primeau is necessarily a bad pickim was just trying to locate the beginning of murrays decisionshe slowness in trading carson has delayed primeaus developmentand you have to wait longer for big players oftenand primeau can be a very good player without being a pointagameplayer especially on a team that has yzerman and fedorovif primeau becomes joel otto and gets 00 goals a season and plays meanit will have been an extremely good pick  gerald   
   a little bio from sunsentinel torrey the architect of four consecutive stanley cup champions as  persident and general manager of the new york islanders throughout his 00 years in the nhl bill torreys bow ties have become as much of a signature as andre agassis hair  the panthers will introduce a uniform insignia and ticketprice  information in early next month  in the meantime huizenga leaves the daytoday operation in the hands of torrey and bob clarke the vp and gm   the san jose sharks and ottawa senators are each on their second gm alreadyid be willing to wager that both the sharks and senators will probably see their 0rd gms and perhaps their 0th before we see the panthers second  gerald  
   gerald olchowy golchowyalchemychemutorontoca writes  podein is an interesting casebecause he was eligible to  play in cape breton in the ahl playoffs like kovalev zubov  and anderssonobviously sather and pocklington are not  the total scrooges everyone makes them out to becertainly  in this case theyve massively outclassed paramount and the  new york rangers  what is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus wc i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev zubov and andersson for binghamton but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play for springfield while nylander wanted to play for sweden the whalers allowed the nhl to decide and the nhl chose the wcs how does this differ from the rangers and oilers did the whalers have to go through the league or could they have forced nylander to play in springfield   obviously it is ultimately the teams choicethe nhl would obviously prefer not to annoy the european hockey federations but the nhl right now cannot force nhl teams to free their playersthe whalers probably did it this way so as to not annoy their farm team affiliate  gerald

   here is a press release from the white house   remarks by president clinton to ncaa division i champion hockey team april 00 qa following  to national desk  contact white house office of the press secretary 0000000000     washington april 00  following is a transcript of remarks by president clinton to the university of maine black bears ncaa division i hockey champions                             the rose garden   000 am edt       the president  good morning ladies and gentlemen  its an honor for me to welcome the university of maine black bears the winner of the ncaa division i hockey national championship to the rose garden and the white house  i understand from senator mitchell that this is the first team from the university of maine every to win a national championship  and were glad to have them here       im inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory       coming from a state that is also relatively small in size but also filled with pride and tradition and community i can understand how the people of maine must feel about the black bears in our state people are still talking about the time we won the orange bowl over the number one ranked football team and that was back in 0000  im sure that 00 years from now the people of maine will as proud of this team as they are today       you know in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey  we dont have a lot of ice  laughter but after spending three months getting banged around in this town i can understand a little more about hockey than i did before i came here  hockey is a tough game  its a hardhitting sport  it does have one virtue though theres a penalty for delay of game  i wish we had that rule in the senate  laughter       in government as in hockey leadership is important  in the united states senate our team has a great captain the majority leader and the senior senator from maine george mitchell junior senator  cohen looks so young i cant imagine  laughter  im actually bitter about senator cohen because he looks so much younger than me       on your hockey team the captain jim montgomery has done a great job  he scored the winning goal late in the championship game leading you to a comefrombehind victory  something else i know a little bit about       sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities  i share the pride that senator mitchell and senator cohen and congressman andrews and all the people of maine must feel for the black bears who have shown us all how to play as a team how to bring out the best in one another and how to come from behind       i think its important as i ask young people from around america who have achieved outstanding things in working together to come here to the white house to be recognized and appreciated by their country to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives       we now have another role model and im glad to have them here today  applause       the president is presented with team jersey applause       the president  thats great  i love it  its beautiful applause       the president is presented with an autographed stick       the president  thank you  thats great  applause                                           q  mr president did you authorize the move on waco this morning sir       the president  i was aware of it  i think the attorney general made the decision  and i think i should refer all questions to her and to the fbi       q  did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed       the president  no they made the tactical decisions that was their judgment the fbi       q  is this a raid       the president  and i will  i want to refer you to  talk to the attorney general and the fbi  i knew it was going to be done but the decisions were entirely theirs all the tactical decisions       q  what did you and senator mitchell talk about this morning       q  any chance for that stimulus package       the president  senator mitchell ought to pay my quarter  laughter  i was in there  laughter       senator mitchell  you have to pay that quarter       the president  i was ready  laughter  senator mitchell hes worth a quarter any day       q  any chance for your bill sir       the president  we talked about what was going to happen this week in the senate and about what other meetings were going to have for the rest of the week  we only had about five minutes to talk  and we agreed wed get back together later around noon and talk some more       q  senator dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise       the president  well i know he did but look senator dole and a lot of the other republicans now in the senate voted for the same kind of thing for ronald reagan in 0000 and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 00 emergency spending measures totalling over 000 billion when reagan and bush were president in those administrations  and many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the american people back to work  i dont want to go back and revisit every one but you   can do it  you can look at the research there  so this position theyre taking is not credible  we have a very tough fiveyear deficit reduction plan  all these costs are covered during that time and then some  and the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for dont have much of a history on which to base their position  theyve got 00 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the american people back to work  so i think weve got a chance to work it out and im hopeful well see what happens today and tomorrow  im feeling pretty good about it       the press  thank you                                   end       0000 am edt   00

  how long can the leafs play shorthanded and still be expected to score  they did some fine penelykilling in the first 0 men down for a couple of minutes at one point but they just couldnt keep it  up  they spent virtually the entire game either shorthanded or just coming off a penelty  as soon as theyd get regrouped theyre penalized again   sheesh  like gilmour said after the 0st  you cant go calling  every little push an shove in a game like that  and if youre going to you have to do it for both teams   pearson one of my four favorite leafs played like a bonehead  i saw him personally screw up at least 0 good scoring opportunities and then he got that bonehead 0minute major highsticking penalty   cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a handfull of games ago and he played a good game  if the other players on his line can smarten up that line should do okay  clarks got to get tough  hes got to intimidate and go for the net  send clark up the left  wing over the blue line a couple times his patented wrist shot will put some numbers on the board and pearson heck maybe he should be benched   i hate to repeat grapes but where the heck was foligno  zezel cant do all the checking himself  and get macllwain on the move we  need some speed out there  keep potvin in net he did okay  considering although like i said a couple weeks ago potvin  messed up in a couple games in the ahl playoffs last year  he can  easily do it again   my prediction last week was toronto in 0  that the games det wins  will be blowouts and the game tor wins will be close  i still stand by that   dont fret leafs fans in order to win in 0 the other team has to win 0    burns is going to make some magic  hell mix up some lines  match the wings lineperline  hell have his team checking hard and hell never let them get outnumbered in their own end  the leafs will win wednesday night and will take 0 or their home games probably the first one   stephen leaf legge sleggekeanucsmunca   
     during the detroit game mon night there were octopus thrown on    the ice what is the meaning or symbolism here  they used to    throw fish on the ice here in spokane afew years ago i never     knew where this came from  
  all these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at njd they are a very deep team with two very capable goalies and excellent forwards and defensemen  shooter in richer an all around do it all in todd chef stasnymaster of a thousand dishes power play  kevin todd is an oiler and has been one for months how closely do you follow the devils anyway jeez  alan  
   are people here stupid or what it is a tie breaker of cause they  have to have the same record how can people be sooooo stuppid to put win as  first in the list for tie breaker if it is a tie breaker how can there be  different record man i thought people in this net are good with hockey  i might not be great in math but tell me how can two teams ahve the same points  with different record manretard cant believe people actually put  win as first in a tie breaker  then allow me to enlighten you rex you see theres a thing called a tie  a tie is worth one point i know i know youre not good at math but bear with me a win is worth two points so getting two ties is the same as  getting one win if your team played two games won one and lost one youd have two points if my team played two games and tied them both wed also have two points wed be tied in the standings even though our records are different  perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again i am starting to sound like roger or what  alan  
  gballenthudsonuvicca greg  ballentine writes  all of this is fine  i never said that murray was a bad gm  i merely said that he isnt the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor if murray is as great as you claim the wings would have won the stanley cup by now probably more than once  if he was as great a gm as you claim  i think you missed one of my points there  it takes more than a great gm to win a stanley cup even once  some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one  i agree that you and i could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best gm in hockey that is a matter of opinion and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine  but the point of my original original post if not well stated was that murray has the gm abilities but not the coaching abilities  which leads to below  and he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success  i think at this point theres a personal emotional element involved here which transcends murrays logical thought  as outsiders its fine for  us to say he should hire a different coach  in fact he has talked about doing so in the past  but the press here in detroit at least has so built up this business about murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach that i think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he is capable of coaching a team past the second round  he needs to as the papers say get that monkey off his back so it becomes a matter not of intelligence but of pride  is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic  perhaps but were all a little that way from time to time  i think eventually hell step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his gm duties and the team will improve as a result  i think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on gm work  in that sense once he steps down as coach well see how good of a gm he really is  but murray is an average unspectacular nhl coach and a pretty good gm so none of this is true anyway  i may not agree with everything youve said but its been fun discussing it with you  gregmeister  randy   
  i cant believe that espn is making sportschannel america look good  but only in nynj philadelphia and chicago everywhere else the only reason sportschannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts and local baseball preempted the nhl playoffs thus far into this playoff season espnabc has given me more hockey in 0 days 0 game than sportschannel did 0 games  if people want hockey on tv they should watch hockey on tv i bet the ratings for hockey on sunday on abc went into the toilet next week there will be far fewer abc affiliates with hockey  someone in this thread said that he wouldnt watch the games even if they were on tv and this is a rsh regular contributor  xenophobes north of border neednt fear the usamericanization of our game because usamericans will never figure out how to market hockey here support your team support your game    mike eisler mreengsuncom  not only are they leafs the best team but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburghs  their  players are mighty bright too  i mean he really was going to get his  wallet back right jan brittenson 000 on leafpen woofers in  recsporthockey  
  in article 00apr00000000000000vm0mcgillca jbe0 jbe0musicbmcgillca writes aargh  paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the nhl he called a total of 0 penalties on the habs and one on the nordiques the nords penalty came in ot  stewart being an exnordique himself was looking to call penalties on the habs while letting the nords get away with murderwe was robbed  no  patrick roy is the reason the game was lost and ron hextall is the reason quebec won  everybody said it would come down to goaltending that goaltending was the key etc etc  well the key doesnt quite fit if youre montreal    i dont buy this at all roy was the reason the game was tied and that would not have been the case had dionne kept his cool  hextall gave up 0 very questionable goals himself  both dionnes and bellows shots were misplayed by hextall but just because his gaffes were early in the game no one seems to care roy stood on his head  for the first 00 minutes of the game when the nords were rushing from  endtoend kamenskys minibreak after the tying goal and the first shot by  young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy roy outplayed hextall  for most of the game but roy becomes the villain and hextall the hero  because roys team didnt make full use of their opportunities  hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces  he played very  well but the haller shot off the post in ot the rebound bouncing over  bellows stick the brunet breakaway the 0 chances for leclair  all  those opportunities were not finished off by montreal and it cost them hextall wasnt particularly brilliant on those plays    blaming stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow  he even saw the whole shot dammit  sure no excuse  but it was just the 0 goal the timing stank but against an explosive team like quebec they gave them 0 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary  montreal played a solid game although they still dont know how to clear traffic in front of the net the loss of schneider will hurt even more   i disagree roy played well because he wasnt screened the whole night  the defense for the 0st time this season played remarkably keeping sakic nolan and sundin  out of the slot most of the night  normally i would say that any team that blows a 0goal lead with less than  five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time in a playoff game  especially needs to be smacked upside their collective heads but i dont think this was a team loss although keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first quebec goal    this most certainly was a team loss leclair missed his opportunities as did bellows and brunet dionne took a bad penalty damphousse and lebeau were silent carbonneau and savard were a step behind all night roy gave up the bad goal roy by no means can be singled out for this loss  roy is paid big money to  play  he looked like a player in an industrial league on sakics shot  and hextall didnt on dionnes goal please roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies  and he still is in the top 0 when you consider the defense or lack of one that played in front of him for most of the season  demers should start racicot in the next game  if not that he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or twoand maybe this article if possible  the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the habs they are no better than uninformed fans why should they read the papers they played 00 minutes of burnsian hockey to shut down quebec all they need tonight and for the rest of the series is the  extra 0  red light to face quebecrubbish thats a guaranteed way to end the series 00 who would be taught a lesson by this  the fans the media and racicot perhaps certainly not the rest of the team  i didnt think the wraparound was as bad as the second goal  i also didnt think scott young should have gotten around the defender cant remember who in the first place  but you are correct it shouldnt have gone in regardless  if you mean the goal should never have gone in because there should never have been an ot then i agree but the goal itself was a great piece of work by young roy had both the near and far posts covered but young flipped the puck up under roys arm as he wrappedaround the net  not a bad goal at all  yaska   yaskaeecgtorontoedu  dept of electrical  computer engineering sankar                          university of toronto toronto canada

    to those who are wondering what is happening in minnesota    from what i have seen in the local news tv and newspaper various people  in the area are trying to get a new hockey team  a columnist for the st  paul pioneer press wrote an article giving the inside scoop on the  issue  there are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the twin cities  first the sites target center civic  center st paul and yes even the met center  the columnist was pretty  confident that minnesota will get a team and that the target center will  ultimately win out  he argued however that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably  without the  intersite competition the columnist sorry i cant remember his name  believes that minnesota would have a team by the 000000 season  also  because of the situation with the timberwolves things will be delayed  until unless the city of minneapolis takes over the target center   however they are unlikely to do so until the met center is destroyed  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the met for  conventions and shortterm events even with hockey at target  to add to  this mess a study 0 to 00 months is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the met center which obviously delays the process even  further  i hope that the study is cancelled which will have the effect of  knocking the met center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  minneapolis to take over the target center sooner the city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the met  which may happen regarding possible candidates the three teams are  hartford tampa bay and new jersey  i would prefer the devils minnesota  ice demons although the lightning may have potential  although it hasnt  been announced yet it looks like 0 neutral site games will be played at the  target center next year  apparently the devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible and i wouldnt be surprised to see  hartford and tampa show up there eitherso minnesota may end up  getting another team but it may take a few years   go sabres  robert andolina former buffalonian living in minneapolis randolinpolisciumnedu

  i agree it was great for the espn people to show the detroit game my roommate just about sht when they threw the octopus on the ice thanks for explaining the significance of that btw the only problem i had was when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and music especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report other then that hats off to espn now if theyll only make a habit of this yeah right baseball seasons started zzzzzz   koz   lets go caps  
   someone give sportchannel a call or maybe ted turner  wasnt usa network covering the playoffs years ago    jim g  oh to be back in the good old days when i lived in florida florida for petes sake and could watch hockey every night as espn and usa alternated coverage nights oh well i guess it would be too simple for the home office to look back into their past to solve a problem in the present  of course i shouldnt complain at least im getting to watch the playoffs for a change hooray now if the espn schedulers will realise there are other teams except pittsberg in the patrick sounds like a dr suess book   koz  lets go caps  
  hell is anderson  anderson can in days past get under peoples skin  put a little more bluntly anderson has to be an asshole he used to be good at it  we need him now    agreed anderson was nowhere last night   well what do you expectburns was playing him with krushelnyski and baumgartneranderson is a finisherunless you play him with someone to can get him the puck in a finishing positionhe aint going to do much scoring  gerald  
  this is a general question for us readers  how extensive is the playoff coverage down there  in canada it is almost impossible not to watch a series on tv ie the only two series i have not had an opportunity to watch this year are washnyi and chistl the latter because im in the wrong time zone  we in canada are basically swamped with  coverage and i wonder how many seriesgames are televised nationally or even locally in the us and how much precedence they take over say local news if the games go into doubleot  email me so as not to waste bandwidth please  my news feed is kind of slow anyways  l0tr   
    game two of the detroit  toronto series will be a rougher game  i believe that clark will be coming out hitting on all cylindars  i believe that probert will take exception to this and a fight between clark and probert will result   i know this sounds kind of ridiculous but i know game two toronto will come out hitting   any takers on this issue

   sleggekeanucsmunca writes   i was wtahcing right guard hockey week on tsn yesterday and they had a feature on this guy that does a lot most of the masks for nhl goalies  they talked about how they are made what they are made of and the designs that are put on them etc   the best one of all was one he never talked about he just held it up it has the current leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking  black panther on the forehead  it has to be a new mask for felix potvin but he never said whose it was    are you sure this program was current i know that grant fuhr  had a black panther on the forehead of his mask when he played with  the leafs   it would seem logical that the mask is potvins his nickname is the cat  which would go a long ways towards explaining the panther   of course it could be an old story and the mask is fuhrs too  alan

  by dave luecking of the postdispatch staff  at 000 thursday night the scoreboard watchers at the arena began to cheer their cheer quickly turned into a roar and finally the sellout crowd of 00000 rose as one to rock the old barn at 0000 oakland avenue in a salute to the playoffbound blues  the scoreboard had just flashed the news from detroit  red wings 0 stars 0 with the north stars loss the blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the norris division good thing because the blues quit playing  they held a 00 lead over tampa bay when the detroitminnesota final appeared with 0 minutes 00 remaining in the second period they promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 00 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer tampas bob beers tipped in a pass from shawn chambers but officiating supervisor john damico and video goal judge rich schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired  im glad i didnt see it go in at the end blues coach bob berry said  if the goal had counted hed have been more upset than he was by the blues disappearance in the final 00 minutes holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered berrys anger  it wasnt pretty at the end he said we played 00 00 great minutes as good as we played all year it slipped away at the end it shouldnt have but it did  still the blues won prompting another ovation from the crowd at games end despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season the blues still made the playoffs theyll meet the chicago blackhawks in a bestofseven norris division semifinal beginning at noon sunday at chicago stadium  the blues finished the regularseason with a record of 000000 for 00 points their fourth consecutive plus000 season minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place with a record of 0000 00 for 00 points tampa bay which played spoiler last week by tying the blues 00 at tampa ended its first season with a record of 00000 for 00 points  the poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous blues locker room instead the mood was one of relief and some disappointment  its a shame we let down said kevin miller one of three blues to score two goals brendan shanahan and bob bassen were the others there was no need for a letdown if wed have kept working it would have ended 00 and everyone would be happy  instead a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs we won and thats all that matters said brett hull scoreless and minus0 for the night once we got up 00 it was really tough to play  some players didnt have a problem  just because the score was announced our line didnt quit said rich sutter who played with bassen and miller we still had a game to play you cant allow five goals like we did thats not right  it was disappointing to see what was going on  bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the blues effort somehow he missed the announcement of minnesotas loss  i didnt know it was final he said i was kind of looking around on the bench i didnt realize it was a final for some reason were in the playoffs and thats great but its a little disappointing to play like we did at the end  the letdown was precisely the reason that berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the minnesotadetroit score off of the board the score showed 00 until it first popped up with detroit leading 00 in the third period the blues already led 00 at the time  i told them i didnt want to see the score i didnt want to know the score berry said i felt we had to win the game and thats the approach we took  if minnesota took a lead berry feared the pressure of having to win might bother the blues if detroit led he worried the blues might quit  until the announcement the blues played splendidly shanahan got the crowd going at 0000 of the first period scoring his 00th of the season then miller and bassen took charge late in the period  with the teams playing four on four miller broke in on left wing deked defenseman roman hamrlik and beat former blues goalie pat jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 000 seconds remaining in the period  then just 000 seconds later bassen rifled a long slap shot past jablonski after defenseman rick zombo intercepted a tampa pass in the neutral zone  bassen made it 00 just 00 seconds into the second period scoring on the  rebound of bret hedicans shot the goal gave him his first twogoal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend  last year bassen befriended young oliver mulvihill who died of a rare form of cancer at age 0 on feb 00  i was thinking of my buddy oliver bassen said hes in heaven now and i know he was watching i know hes happy  miller increased the blues lead to 00 on a breakaway goal set up by zombo at 0000 then steve maltais broke curtis josephs shutout just 00 seconds later making it 00  less than a minute after the north stars final was announced tim bergland scored and cut the lead to 00 but shanahan scored his 00st converting a pass from nelson emerson with 000 seconds remaining in the  second period  then it was all lightning adam creighton scored 00 seconds into the third period prompting berry to rest the overworked joseph guy hebert allowed goals to shawn chambers and danton cole in a span of 000 midway through the third period  the goals by chambers and cole made shanahans second goal stand up as the winner we were in there shanahan said the game was over we were in                                          a l l e z   l e s   b

      how long would they support teams that are run on rangerbased   corporate thinking i use the term lightly  we dont need a good  product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawas  record every year0000 haha sorry had ta say it  look how long the maple leafs and nordiques used similar logic  not that they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams but the maple leafs and a certain dead man who was in charge were one of the cheapest teams in the history of the sport  guess what they were immensely popular at the gate  the nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the playoffs so many years in a row   look at british or any european soccer as an example they never have fan  problems  ha  such humor  they have major fan problems namely that on occasion some of them dont make it home from the match  the soccer fans tend to be fanatical much like the montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when they play pathetically   jpc     john p curcio           go bruins   philips laboratories jpcphilabsphilipscom            000 scarborough road 000 0000000                     briarcliff manor ny 00000

  well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while chicago sweeps stlouis that just makes it easier in the second round with all the rest they will get and tordet getting none for the conf champ they will have a hard time versus the division but that div will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the hawks again then bring pitt and sure the hawks will probably lose but its better to get that far and lose than to not go  brian   hopefully a miracle ok not quite a miracle but close will occur and pittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals  if they make it again  they will probably keep the cup  if they dont its the hawks turn  go blackhawks  congrats to jeremy roenick for being only the 0nd hawks player to post  back to back 00 goal seasons  scott

  slacellegandalfca stephane lacelle writes  the ottwawa senators fired mel bridgman at 000 pm today randy sexton is gonna replace him  trashy move from a trashy organization after the front office stated that nobody would lose their job over the sens poor performance bridgeman is gone within 00 hours of the teams final game  yesi know he screwed up letting the kings grab loach  sextons qualifications aside from being cheap   he played some us college hockey  hes pals with club president bruce firestone  just the kind of experience you need when trying to build an expansion franchise hell probably be in the hall of fame next year   this continues a tradition of front office gaffs  paul anka and the arena deal  denis potvin and the gm postion  mike bossy and the scoring coach  how do people in ottawa feel about how the club is being run  stephane lacelle  brian down bdownvistorontoedu  
   ive heard that you can score on belfour by shooting high  because he goes down a lot and on potvin by shooting high  on him and then getting the rebound in because he plays so deep in the net  any truth to these   brad  a wings fan but no predictions

  farewell minnesota fans  get stuffed dallas stars  as the north stars fade to black i hope that minneapolisst paul are not long without an nhl team  it just seems right that the hotbed of amateur hockey in the usa should have an nhl team as well  the loss of the team is certainly not the fault of the fans though the start of the 000000 season made it look real bad for a while  i wish now that i kept the north stars cap i bought at maple leaf gardens the morning after they eliminated montreal in 0000  i got it to spite the montreal fans in the small town where i grew up  what a glorious season that was for the north stars       dwarf  w jim jordan                           i dont mean to tell you how to live dwarfx000gatebnrca internet         your lifethats what the tvs for i work for bnr i do not speak for it   but if i didnt believe in jesus id                                          be going to hell       peter heath

    jagr has a higher  but francis has had more points  and take it from an informed observer ronnie francis has had a much better season than jaromir jagr  this is not to take anything away from jaro who had a  decent year although it didnt live up to the expectations of some  bowman tended to overplay francis at times because he is a bowmanstyle player  he plays hard at all times doesnt disregard his defensive responsibilities and is a good leader  bowman rewarded him be increasing his ice time  jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude this rubbed bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time  throughout the year francis consistently recieved more ice time than jagr  althouhg i have never seen stats on this subject i am pretty sure that jagr had more points per minute played that francis  when you add to that jagrs better  rating i think it becomes evident that jagr had a better season not that francis had a bad one  gregmeister  
  my vote goes to john vanbiesbrouck  his mask has a skyline of new york city and on the sides there are a bunch of bees beezer  it looks really sharp  funny you should mention this one time on hnic don cherry pointed out vanbiesbroucks mask  he hated it  i think he said something to the effect of you see  he was great last year now he goes out and gets that dopey mask  and he cant stop a beachball  you may or may not take cherry seriously at all but i cracked up when i heard it  i think ed belfour has the current best mask in the nhl btw  i also like moogs and ill give fuhrs new one an honourable mention although i havent seen it closely yet it looked good from a distance  whats also neat is chevaldaes in detroit they call him chevy so he has two checkered flags painted at the top as in an auto race

   joel alvstad writes  a fine 00 year history came to a close tonight as the minnesota north stars  or norms stars whichever you prefer lost to the red wings by a score of 00  the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen who netted two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to play  this is very sad indeed  my condolences to the minnesota fans who are losing their team  i fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team left in pittsburgh will be the steelers  we should always enjoy things when we can  you never know when theyll be taken away from us  mom    
  especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report  the wings player was yves racine and he returned later in that same period  mike  
  when is the draft this year  and will there be any coverage i know the upcomming nfl draft is on espn  anyone got the details  paul kariya 0000 0 pick no 0 perhaps  he wont last long   i dont know the exact coverage in the states  in canada it is covered by tsn so maybe espn will grab their coverage  i dont know  as for the picks ottawa picks 0 which means it is almost 000 that alexander daigle will  go 0 hell either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec  imo i would take kariya  he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in the world championships  daigle didnt show this for his junior team  san jose will then get kariya  tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov i think thats it or a      defenseman rob niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong  because of expansion i wont go further but i will name other of the blue chip prospects      chris gratton     chris pridham     a swedish player who i cant remember his name  draft order  0 ottawa 0 san jose 0 tampa bay 0 south florida or anahiem 0 south florida or anahiem 0 hartford 0 edmonton 0 dallas 0 ny rangers 00 philadelphia  the 0th thru 00th picks could be wrong  i dont have the standings here and am guessing   in my mind there are 0 top notch prospects in the draft with kariya   leading the way but not going 0  shawn  go caps two first round picks for the next three years  thanks                  stlouis or should i say ron caron and scott stevens

  detroit is a very disciplined team  theres a lot of europeans in detroit which would make the game fast so toronto would have to slow the game down which means drawing penalties as a last resort anyway  toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players  toronto is just an average team detroit isnt ballard screwed toronto when he was owner  everyone knows that and its going to take time for toronto to become a real force i expect gilmour to be burnt out next year  he cant pull the whole team forever  patrick walker university of new brunswick

  jouko kylmaoja wrote    i watched the game germanyczechs in wc todayand i was astonished about  the behaviour of the german audience  the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went  grazy they threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis  that stupid or what i guess the canadian referee one of the  isostarbros  gave the german team a penalty for that but it didnt help  much  i guess the germans just are proud over their nazikillemalleveryone  butusgermanssucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude  in every possible sport remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer  it really pisses me off  i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks but   most of them seem to do  i can understand your anger about the german audience i mean it was the finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the canadien ref called in the last period the germans got a match penalty and a 00 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the german goalie got two minutes for delay of game for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd the resulting 00 skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point when the germans were starting to come up strong i am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in german sports events if you watch for example a tennis davis cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes because the crowd is so obnoxious but i have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries you should go to the us and watch the way they present the olympics on television or the soccer crowds in england or the finnish spectators at nordic skiing events i mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and i would rather see the best teamplayer win and get cheared at i do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and i have to admit that in most sports the german national site is not my favorite team to watch the german soccer team is boring to watch for example but reading the above posting i think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing it is easy to talk of nearly all germans as nazis and nationalists thats the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against germany it is true that there is a great danger of rearising nationalism in germany but from my experience most of the people at least of the people that i know also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now why cant we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality eg all russians are communists all americans are capitalists all germans are nazis all fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries  in my opinion your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you dont seem to be different from the nazis you are talking about  thomas   theres no time to hate barely time to wait jerry garciarobert hunter

   ok it seems that everyone else in canada was treated to the  real abc telecast while only the people on rogers tv in surrey bc  were treated to two channels with don i stink as a commentator whitman doing the playbyplay  the godfather  
   as for the picks ottawa picks 0 which means it is almost 000 that alexander daigle will  go 0 hell either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec  imo i would take kariya  he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in the world championships  daigle didnt show this for his junior team  san jose will then get kariya  tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov i think thats it or a      defenseman rob niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong  the last name is niedermayer as in new jerseys scotts last name because you guessed it they are brothers  but rob niedermayer is a center not a defenseman  i am not sure that the sharks will take kariya  they arent saying much but they apparently like niedermayer and victor kozlov along with kariya  chris prongers name has also been mentioned  my guess is that theyll take niedermayer  they may take pronger except that they already have too many defensive prospects   go calgary flames  al macinnis for norris  gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in edmonton  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu recsporthockey contact for the san jose sharks

  000000 los angeles kings notes  playoffs  stauber disturbed by thirdman theme by rick sadowski daily news  barry melroses decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender  i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most fun time of the year and im not  stauber said with some emotion monday  i think i have worked hard enough for that  stauber said he accepts melroses choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the calgary flames hrudey made 00 saves in sundays 00 opening victory  but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no 0 man behind rick knickle  stauber had a 000 record and 000 goalsagainst average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no 0 job from hrudey  knickle  he won 0 of 0 decisions but had a bloated 000 average twice was  yanked from games once for stomach cramps and hasnt played since march 00  yet when the series resumes wednesday knickle will serve as hrudeys backup again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic saddledome popcorn  if im supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starteri dropped too 0  what happened to no 0  stauber wondered  not that id be happy with no 0 but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs  perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance but melrose apparently is not convinced the 00year old is capable of handling playoff pressure  while insisting he is the kings goalie of the future melrose said stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season  they were according to melrose a 00 loss to san jose on dec 00 an 00 loss to the new york rangers on jan 00 a 00 tie with detroit on feb 00 an 00 loss to  vancouver on thursday  four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could have taken it away from kelly hrudey and he didnt do it melrose said  an elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him  the mark of a great goalie is that he isnt satisfied to be a backup  im not blaming robb for the losses but if youre going to be no 0 youve got to be able to walk your talk  youve got to be able to play when everything is on the line  robb stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe i expect more from him than he does  ouch  that remark stung stauber  he began the season 000 struggled when the team hit a midseason slump didnt play for a month after knickle was signed off the san diego gulls roster then came on at the end  i expect more from myself than anybody including barry melrose said stauber a threeyear star at the university of minnesota who left school in 0000 only  to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries  what ive been through the last four years  two knee operations a herniated disk in my back shoulder surgery  what more can i go through  i obviously do expect a lot from myself otherwise i wouldnt be here  anybody who would disagree with that doesnt know me  im not saying barry  doesnt know me but dont say ive been without expectations  if anything im a perfectionist  stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned but  even though i didnt play well i get knocked down from maybe on to three its  a bit of a jump he said  youre almost no 0 or if you play a good game  youre no 0 and if you dont youre no 0  why does jack nicklaus shoot a 00  and then a 00  can you explain that  thats what barry wanted me to explain  to him why i didnt come through when he counted on me  i dont know what i  do know is its a sport  ill be there  melroses goalie of the future statement doesnt mean much to stauber before you know it ill be 00 and there will be no future he said    game 0 of the kings  flames playoff series drew a 00 nielsen rating on abc  channel 0 here in la  the kings averaged a 00 nielsen rating in the 00 regular season games aired on channel 0  around the nhl  san jose fired coach george kingston who lead the team to a 00000 mark in  their 0nd nhl season  kingston was 000000 over the past 0 years with the sharks    former islander executive bill torrey was named as president of the expansion florida panthers  bobby clarke was named as the clubs general manager  last nights games  win  0  van  0 van leads 00 tor  0  det  0 det leads 00   stan willis willisempirednethaccom net contact la kings          talk with the la kings mailing list  kingscsstanfordedu       to subscribe or unsubscribe  kingsrequestcsstanfordedu

    00min   bill ranford stopped 00 shots to lead canada to a 00 victory in a very well  played game   the first period started with a give away from a canadian defenseman and  rundqvist came in alone on ranford but couldnt put the puck over a sliding  ranford later on kevin dineen had a great opportunity but soderstrom   played very well too stefan nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up  jan larsson but again ranford came up big period ended scoreless but the edge  to sweden in creating more opportunities  second period action saw tommy soderstrom making a great save mark recchi  made a backhanded cross ice pass to lindros eric one timed the puck but  soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save at the 0minute mark canada  started applying pressure on the swedes sandersondineenbrindamour worked  hard and kept the puck in the swedes zone dineen gave the puck to sanderson  who skated around a screened swedish defenseman came in on soderstrom and  made a wrist shot that went it by soderstroms far post 00 canada  the swedes picked up their game after that and peter forsberg had a shot  that hit ranfords post the inside went parallel to the goal line and out  then gartner got a penalty and the swedes a power play jan larsson took  a shot from the slot ranford gave a rebound to larsson who saw juhlin by  the far post passed the puck and ranford was beat 00  third period started as the other periods swedes having most of the pressure  but the canadians always dangerous once they were close to the swede goal  at 000 canada created some great chances and arto blomsten was forced to  cover the puck in the swede goal crease since soderstrom lost sight of it  that resulted in a penalty shot since a defenseman cant cover the puck in   the goal crease geoff sanderson took the penalty shot his first ever he  explained afterwards and he put it low on soderstroms stick side close  to the post excellent penalty shot to give canada a go ahead goal  canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside gartner volleyed a  bouncing puck past soderstrom to make it 00 the swedes ran out of gas  then and couldnt produce as good scoring chances as they had for 00 periods  the 00 goal came with only 0 second left rod brindamour scoring on a  rebound from soderstrom where the swedish defense already had their minds  in the dressing room   a very good game the best in the wc so far with both goalies playing  great soderstrom best player in sweden but ranford even played better  than soderstrom that tells you something about ranford probably the best  goalie in the world were some comments after the game  canada played a very disciplined defense ranford pointed out that it is  easy to play well with a good defense lindros played a lot and played well  sanderson naturally game hero with two goals   the forsbergnaslundbergqvist line swedens best along with larssonjuhlin  nilsson swedish defense played well 000 cm 000 kg peter popovic had the  task of neutralizing 000 cm 000 kg eric lindros and managed this very well  ranger defenseman peter andersson finally got to go to the wc and considering  that he landed in germany just a few hours before the game he played very  well swedish coach curt lundmark was irritated after the game partly because  of the swedes inability to score and partly because of the linesmans mistake  on the

  plarsensanjuan p allen larsen writes  in article boora000000000sfuca boorakitssfuca the godfather writes was the abc coverage of the kingsflames game supposed to be the way it was shown in bc with cbc overriding the abc coverage  when i flipped to abc it was the same commentators same commercials even  my question is  was this the real abc coverage or did cbc just black out the  abc coverage for its own   yes its called simulcast  in canada when a canadian station and an  american station are showing the same thing whether a sporting event or cheers on thursday night the canadian signal is broadcast over the american station they even do this during the superbowl which has the best commercials of any television  what do we get here dumb canadian commercials the same ones weve seen for that last year or so  im in edmonton and while thats usually or at least often the case here we were treated to the actual abc telecast of the kingsflames game  im with whoever said it earlier  don witless er whitman is a poor commentator and not just for hockey  normally if the oilers were still playing augh i would turn off the sound and listen to  the radio broadcast to get decent playbyplay announcing  bart edmonton

   relying on canadian tourists and transplanted northeasterners to support a team in miami is crazy espaecially when you have really deserving  cities without a team such as san diego  milwaukee i wish the panthers or whatever their name is well but if they cant sell to hispanics theyre in deep doodoo already there are rumors that tampa may move to milwaukee  
   i loved the abc coverage the production was excellent the appearance was excellent it had a sleek modern look this was the first time i heard thorne  clement  i thought they were great my only request is to leave al micheals out of this he annoys me  im hoping this leads to a regularseason contract my guess would be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from febapril and then the  playoffs i envy you canadians with your tsn  cbc maybe ill get a dish to pick up canadian tv how much are those things btw  
  first off anyone accepted into the western business school is not a dork  second just because one person out of a country of 00 million doesnt think before heshe posts an article does not mean that heshe is embarrasing canada this network is for expressing what you feel are your thoughts just because someone doesnt agree with you this does not give you the right to call them assholes anyways the north stars are shit   cmon leafs   whoa there  lighten up andrew  when i was referring to you dorks at the western business school i was specifically referring to those assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of minnesota for no apparent reason  being canadian and one who has friends who attended uwo i personally dont want to be associated with the idiots who wrote those messages  one more thing andrewuntil this season the leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen years have they won the cup during our lifetimeso the north stars havent been the only shit team in the norris  kea    
   on tuesday when it was raining in chicago espn provided  bonus hockey coverage  now it seems as though some fans are ticked off that the nywash ot was replaced with the angels game  people must realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the us   the baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so they cant skip the baseball game  why dont you people chill out and enjoy whatever coverage you can get  geoff filinuk

    quoting cire y trehguad to all  cyt  michael collingridge writes   and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded    resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other    team captain trivia would be appreciated   kelly kisio was the captain of the rangers when he left for san jose    ali    ali procrastination lemer  but not a real green  conjunction junction columbia university nyc    dress thats cruel   whats your function phoenixctrcolumbiaedu      barenaked ladies      schoolhouse rock  be kind to animalshug a hockey player   
  quebec dominated habs for first 0 periods and only roy kept this one from being rout although he did blow 0nd goal canadians showed up in third but nords were playing dump  pull back most of the time  do you notice that nobody on the team is willing to take charge a dominant defenceman would be nicetoo bad schneider got hurt he reminds me of chris chelios sometimes  speaking of chelios i  wonder if serge savard feels like a moron for making that trade i also wish we still had corson  rob ramage on the ice is less useful than a gatorade bottle on the  bench  vincent damphousse has decided to take a vacation apparently  i have no idea why demers is playing denis savard on the checking line with carbonneau  savard is skating well and is one of the only dangerous canadiens in quebecs zone with the puck  too bad nobody is in front most of the time  do you also notice that in the defensive zone not a single nordique gets knocked down  its disgusting  we also have lebeau 000 000 getting pasted at centre ice by wolaninn 00 000 with no reply from the team except to yell for a penalty  dammit denis savard  threw the best only montreal hit of the night when he knocked sundin offbalance  when denis savard is your teams enforcer theres big trouble someplace  hextall made some good saves but really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 0  could have had 0 plus another 0 in 0nd  aside from that second goal roy did stand on his head  the third  period at least provided something to look forward to  habs won the period imo and i guess somebody finally came along to smack them a couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game had started at 000  hopefully they play that way at home  roy made  the saves well ignore that second goal so now its up to the team    dchhabrastplistsca   ps  to all those grant fuhr doubtersbuffalo 0 boston 0   nuff said  and did somebody say dale hunter was a playoff choker id rethink that position     
     come on boston where the hell are you seven wins in a row and what choke  id much rather see the bruins in the wales conference finals vs pitt than buffalo or quebec if only because it would be more interesting  not that buffalo or quebec cant put up a good fight but id much more enjoy a 00 pasteing of the bruins than the devils  you have to feel for terrerrisp  ah well maybe the devils will pull it out or maybe the pens will lose in the second round but if not i hope the bruins are there to meet them   
  in article 0000apr000000000000ncsuedu delarocqeosncsuedu derrell emery larocque writes     tonight in boston the buffalo sabres blanked the boston bruins 00 tonight in boston looks like boston can hang this season up because buffalos home record is awesome this is great buffalo fans might get to see revenge for last year    im glad grant fuhr will never be as overconfident after two wins as you areit takes four wins to defeat an opponenteach tougher to obtain than the previous one  buffalo is off to a good start fuhr is proving the fuhrbashers wrong but boston is an awfully good team   gerald  awesome home record or not you need to remember the 0th game last year at the aud  id like to see some playoff games since im stuck in buffalo at ub but i think boston isnt giving up so easy  mr bungle

  lmarshacmsccwayneedu laurie marshall writes  don got his nickname grapes but im not sure  don use to coach the boston bruins  i dont know exactly when that was  could someone fill me in on this info  i think that the name grapes came because as coach for the bruins  or in the minors  he used to chew on grapes to keep from getting  dehydrated during the games  his dog blue may have been named  cause he liked labatts beer  anyone know about that

   so in other words if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out  the penguins thats immaterial because it was the coaches decision come on  joe think about what youre saying who they played is very significant  why they played them is whats irrelevent a low gaa against good teams  is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two  goaltenders a low gaa is better then a higher gaa a low gaa against good  teams is much much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context  of comparing two goaltenders  lets start over  im not arguing about who is the better goaltender  id take soderstrom right now  what i am saying is that roussel can be a 0 netminder  the gaa difference is less than half a goal per game less than that after last night their save percentages are close and their records are similar  and with that i just dont see how you can label roussel as the most disappointing player on the flyers this season  you say soderstrom played against better competition  that may very well be but there is no way of knowing how roussel would have performed in those games  besides against the better scoring teams like pittsburgh the defense is more keyed up than they are against san jose   the same  for roussel in the ranger game two real scoring chances one he made a  great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player if  you were judging roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by  but im not just judging roussel on that game alone  ive seen him play for the past two seasons in philly and before that in hershey  its just my opinion but i think hes got what it takes  of course i thought that about mark laforest too  but i never did about wendell young  so im batting 000 in judging hershey talent since the hextallera  as for the rangers game you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like  but rou had his leg in position to make the save  if he didnt it wouldnt have mattered if the rangers player didnt get the puck up or not  it would have been a goal  on a breakaway thats what the goalie wants to do take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him   but if you were to look at the 00 tie against the habs you saw a goalie  stand on his head to get that shutout that was a 0 goalie in action roussel  doesnt have a game like that in him  i seem to remember roussel doing an excellent job against pittsurgh on opening night to give the flyers a tie against the twotime defending champs  and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the habs  but you cant tell me that a montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it  mistakes both on offense and defense are part of the game  or thered never be shutouts  anyway im happy the flyers have both soderstrom and roussel and im not going to argue about it anymore  besides with the current 0game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year i dont want to piss you off to the point that you dont sell me any tickets next season                                             joe dakes                                  att microelectronics                       000 union boulevard                           allentown pa  00000                     lets go flyers  alux0jmd                                       jmdaluxpoattcom                                                                                  
   tom barrasso wore a great mask one time last season  he unveiled it at a game in boston    it was all black with pgh city scenes on it  the golden triangle pghs downtown area where the 0 rivers meet graced the top along with a steel mill on one side and the civic arena i think on the  other   on the back of the helmet was the old pens logo the really fat little penguin with the blue scarf the current at the time pens logo and a space for the new now current logo  tommy had designed the mask and his mother an artist painted it for him    but while wearing the mask the pens got thumped by the bruins  the very next game tommy was back to the old paint job  a great mask done in by a goalies superstition  lori

   after reading some of the reports of possible nhl moves to milwaukee or that milwaukee should have an nhl team i thought id pass along a story i heard recently  this is second hand so i dont know how true it is but i have no reason to doubt it either  bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge hockey team  the owner of the admirals sorry i cant remember his name either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the bradley center  supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise but  turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of 00 million was too high  like i said i dont know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if its true dont look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon  the admirals arent going to be forced out of the building and you wont see an nhl club and a minor league club in the same building especially since the nbas milwaukee bucks play there as well  charlie betz cray research inc   chippewa falls wi cbetzromuluscraycom

  yes yes i can see it now  all those sabre fans finally taking their sabre sweaters out of the moth balls and proudly wearing them after 0 years of playoff frustration and being up 0 games to nil i guess it is a pretty good bet    but there has not been a team that has come back from an 00 deficit since 0000  could this be the year   dont throw out the moth balls yet  roy  
  i wrote  i feel the jury is still out on tim cheveldae as a playoff goalie he was average in his first playoffs  last year he had a horrible start but played great the last ten games after he was benched his gaa even with the horrible start was 00 last year  this year i think hes going to play very well he has to if detroit is going to win the cup  he wasnt sharp in game 0 but he didnt have to be i thought he looked pretty good yesterday  charles hubbert writes great write up of the wingstoronto series thus far  i agree with just about everything that you said but chevy shouldnt have let the shot from the right point in  first goal mikorov i think  other than that the wings are looking good and chevy is holding his own  not great but maybe  chevy has let in 0 or 0 soft goals so far but they all didnt matter however his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up big when it counts  the score was 00 i think when the goal you mentioned was scored  in the third period when it looked like toronto was coming back chevy was exceptional  i can see him as a barraso style playoff goalie  inconsistant when theres nothing on the line but comes up big when really needed  i guess well both find out  ron   and one of my major goals is to leave the next president a new set of things to worry about  im getting bored reading the same problems in the paper decade after decade  i want people to have to deal with new problems                      president bill clinton   0000  
  susan clark asks hi guys         im looking to answe a bit of trivia  what hockeplayers have appeared on major talk shows on tv ie letterman carsonleno arsenio etcie shows of a national natureinclude canadian equivalents if you can think of any  this can include nhl olympic and world champion ship players  im pretty sure ive seen gretzky and lemieux but i was wondering if there were any others   i am not so sure about the celebrated players of the game but tod hartje who played for harvard in college and then went on to play in the ahl initially for moncton and currently for providence thanks to daryl  turner for the update appeared on david lettermans show about two years ago now  tod has the distinction of being the first american born player to go  and play in the former soviet union this was arranged by jets gm mike  smith while tod was playing in moncton at about the time all those  european players were coming over to north america to play in the nhl  tod spent a year playing in russia and played with or against some of the russian players who have just entered the nhl in the last two years he wrote a book on his experiences called behind the red line check it out and appeared on the letterman show to talk about them   mike   note i hope i have my facts straight it has been a year since i read tods book i wanted to dig the book out to double check but  realized i lent it to a friend and he hasnt returned the book yet  just wait til i get a hold of him  
  david vergolini wrote   did anyone see the montreal  quebec game yesterday  it was tight right down to the last second of the third period  in the overtime roy and hextall played like they were gods ok so montreal won  they deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick  their second goal in overtime was also replayed but i could not tell if it was the montreal player who kicked it in  the puck definitely was not directed in by a stick anyways montreal is back into the series    the overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the quebec  defender who deflected the puck  the replay officials did not  take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first  nongoal so it seemed pretty noncontroversial  i agree that it was a great game good to see roy and damphousse back into form  hopefully the sign of good things to come  paul valin                                     tel  0 000 000 0000 bellnorthern research ltd                    email pavalinbnrca po box 0000 station c ottawa ontario canada k0y 0h0               only my opinions  
  during the first three games of the pensdevils series i have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the pens  jagr maceachern and barrasso have been especially fun to watch  but one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be scotty bowman  despite brooks lunatic comments and despite the devils line changing adantage in last nights game bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the devils in the dark  granted the helldwellers had the pens bottled up for a while last night but bowman was eventually able to configure his lineup to get the job done  his ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible  bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis  last night for instance he realized that the speed of jagr straka and maceachern was throwing the devils off balance  as a result straka received many more shifts than average jagr played almost the entire game he was always on the puck and maceachern scored a goal while complementing jagr many times throughout the night his ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate and to bring about success  while no one can replace the genius and optimism of badger bob johnson bowman in his own way has made himself a permanent though not clearly seen mark in  pittsburgh   
  i really feel the need for a knowledgable hockey observer to explain this years playoffs to me i mean the obviously superior toronto team with the best center and the best goalie in the league keeps losing what gives               i stand by all the misstatements that ive made  vice president dan quayle to sam donaldson 00000  me too  nick duncan duncanmprgatemprca

  dino getting shots in front of the net he should expect it  this is playoff hockey where anything goes you lose one game in the regular season and its not so bad you lose a game in the playoffs and its a difficult thing to overcome  ive watched hockey and played it too for a number of years and i havent seen one postseason game where the forward in front of the net  has not finished without any bruises on the back of his leg  the leafs are  not doing a good job in clearing the net and potvin has been forced to take matters into his own hands  i remember when cicarelli used to play for the london knights ohl he always was a nuisance in front of the net and the  goalies took exception to this  he also complained in this mornings paper about what happened last night but to me its a lot of bellyaching his  team is up 00 and he complains about being whackedi wonder what would happen if he tried to do the same thing in front of billy smith or a younger ron hextall seems dino would need two artifical legs  dino should take it  as part of the game and thank his lucky stars that hes in the playoffs and has a good chance to go the finals   well i agree that if youre going to stand in front of the net that you should expect to get hit and hacked at in general you should expect to finish the game with some bruises however there is a fine line between hacking at a guy causing some pain and discomfort and blatantly attempting to injure another player felix potvin imo crossed that line on wednesday that two hander on ciccarelli was way out of line i lost a lot of respect for potvin because of that it showed an immaturity he did not slash at ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area a legal position for dino to be in instead he slashed in an attempt to injure it was out of shear frustration as a leaf supporter just a supporter im not a leaf fan really i was very disappointed  youre right in mentioning billy smith and ron hextall at least in his philly days they both crossed that same line at times and for that reason many fans and players disliked them thats why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues lets hope that felix doesnt do that again id hate to see anyone even dino  although i admit i dont like him very much get seriously hurt from such careless but intentional use of the stick  gary

    gballentvancouveruvicca greg  ballentine writes  lots of debate about the virtues of bryan murray vs pat quinn as a gm deleted  randy graca seems to think murray is the best gm in the league i think quinn is one of several who are better  plus his team quinns has improved a much greater amount than detroit since he took over with them  how do you figure  both vancouver and detroit did the same thing last year they both won their division they had close to the same number of points they both went down 00 in the first round of the playoffs before finally escaping in 0 games and they both got knocked out in the second round by teams they should have been able to beat with less talent  specifically if i remember correctly third place teams  how does this make vancouver more improved  further if im not mistaken the wings had more points than vancouver at the end of this season albeit not many   when quinn took over vancouver several years ago not last year they  regularily missed the playoffs  i cant recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did  quinn has improved the team from nonplayoff calibre to a serious contender  when murray took over in detroit the were about a 000 team that was a contender to win the norris division and possibly even a stanley cup contender  so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over as a gm quinn is one example of a better gm than murray  gregmeister

  amongst penguins fans there seems to be an inner calm that ive never experienced before this year with the pens the players and the fans have so much confidence in the team this year were savoring every game and saving our energy for the stanley cup  thats not inner calm  its boredom and its being spoiled  the arenas been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just take winning for granted  its been seemingly forever since the team lost and weve forgotten what its like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory  while im glad to have the pens doing so well in some ways it was a better high back when the pens beat the bruins two years ago and the rangers last year too much of a good thing is not always good for you  rick

  heres one from the mill  the oilers might move to hamilton where porklington can get a free deal   the probability is that the oilers are not going anywhere  pocklington has chosen this moment to make his last stand is because he is at the moment of maximum advantagethe provincial government is months away from a provincial electionit is the moment when he has maximum power to convince northlands to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price and it is before the nhls new collective agreement with the players which might involve some enhanced revenuesharing  pocklington is many thingsstupid is not one of them  he can dictate termsbecause other cities will pay his price if edmonton doesnt  edmonton has already fucked up its international airport and surrendered supremacy to calgary and over the next few years edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks it will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find a way to lose its hockey team toobecause northlands wants to continue to use the oilers to subsidize horse racing  however in this case about the longterm financial viability of the oilers the fact is that pocklington is basically  right regardless of who owns the team and it is right to provoke the crisis now before the team accumulates millions of dollars in losses or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack of money  sather has done his jobthe oilers are poised to be competitive again very soon al strachan one of the most knowledgeble hockey writers in canada in a postmortem of the oilers season in the globe and mail recently agrees with me  gerald

       the tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules  overtime time games     that are not shown  what the hell kind of shit is this  if that would     have happened to the flyersif they were in the damn playoffs to begin     with while i was watching i would have gone throught the roof      however everybody is getting pissed off at espn but they are not the     ones to blame  they have prior contracts that they just cant simply break     whenever they want to  the nhl is to blame  when they signed the     deal with espn they had to know of this  they had to know shit like this     would happen since they wouldnt have complete priority  the nhl     should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at espn  how can the     nhl do this to its fans how dare they  we are the ones that make the     damn league exist and they cant even televise complete playoff games for us to     watch  they more i write about this the more pissed off i get  we must     let the nhl know that  we expect a little better than this  if anybody     out there knows how to go about doing this let me and everybody else know      well i had to get that off my chest and while im at it      mario is the michael jordan of hockey  all that fucker has to do is fall     on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 0  last night in the     0rd game between nj and pitt he was being pushed while skating across the     front of the goal while trying to get a shot off  the guy on him was     doing a good job so he got off a weak shot but then he decided to fall     to the ice then the fucking refvan helloamend called the guy for     holding  they replayed the play and my roomatewho is clueless about     hockey wanted to know what the nj guy did to get a call because it was so fucking obvious the nj player     had both hands on his stick and no he did not trip him  it is simple     mario gets touched he falls to the ice automatic 0  but the thing that     really pissed me off is pitt scored the 0rd or 0th goal i dont remember     on the resulting pp and     eventually won 00  his divingcalls makes a huge difference in the     outcome of a game      they gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking     obvious that is not hockey  it allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players and allows inferior teams to beat better ones this has pissed me off for many years now and it has improved somewhat however during the playoffs and 0rd periods the damn refs must misplace their balls because they sure dont make any calls that show that they got any      all agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed      steve        
   there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans  i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages  i think a compromise would work namely honouring personages in  conference names and using geographical references in the divisional  names  although i still do not think the move will draw fans to the game imo its a cosmetic change that bettman and the owners hope  will have an effect  and it doesnt say much for the mentality of  anybody it works on either    another thing that bothers me is the points system  percentages as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative  when i look at the nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand which is almost always the case  some will object to percentages claiming perhaps that it is an americanization of the sport  surprise i agree totally  the points system is fine if everybody at all times has played the same number of games  since this is almost never the case winning percentage is the way to go  i dont particularly care if it  is an american thing either if it works      dchhabrastplistsca  
  bleep bleep bleep  the bruins lost again in ot  i cant stand it  aside from frustrated ravings i must give buffalo credit they are making good  on most of their scoring opportunities and are playing great defense  boston players cant seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the buffalo net except for on rare occasions  the buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds  fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but hes also getting plenty of help boston has been playing rather well better than would be indicated by the  series score of 00 but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the  game  as a result boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 0st period 0 goals down  this must stop if boston is to have any hope of winning a single game the outlook for the bruins advancement to the second round are quite bleak  imho the bruins need to score first  if they can do that they have an excellent chance of winning since they have outplayed the sabres in the  0nd and 0rd periods  the scary thing is that ill be going to grad school in buffalo next year    ill never cheer for the sabres you cant convert me    mtm0   mike mosscrop    die hard bruins fan dept of chemistry umasslowell mosscropmwoodsulowelledu

   wow this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team boston which sweeney you askwell of course bob sweeney the one that boston let buffalo get a hold of they still have 0 sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing  game winner in ot in game 0 and another big goal seconds after fuhr made 0 point blank saves  this is why grant has 0 rings to put buffalo ahead in the 0rd  yes neely countered a minute later but hadnt this course of buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities i think boston would have notched their first win of the series  well the sabres havent made it to the end of this series yet but i certainly feel theyve got boston right were they want themactually theyve got them in a position that neither buffalo nor boston felt that would come about  one more astronomical game by fuhr a few more heroics by the rest of the team this is a team sport afterall and i think borque neely jouneau sp and company are gonna be swinging a new stick weather is perfect for golf season real soon  im not gonna waiger anything on this because ive seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey  talking about golfwas that a hockey swing golf swing or baseball swing that hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that khmylev deflected in for the big one  the whole ot all 0 minute of it was a tesiment to buffalos ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end something they werent necessarily in the regular season  the sabres pushed hard and forced borque to blatently take down bodger in the opening seconds  i dont normally like penalties being called in such ultracritical points but this was blatent  finally the sabres won a faceoff they werent that hot in this dept the rest of the game when lafontaine scooped at the puck 0 times  when hawerchuck took his shot quite a boomer but blue stopped this one he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again without setting it up  i didnt realize it went in until the announcer started screaming they score they score  the best was seeing lafontaine jumping up and down skating a little bit jumping some more and then skating over to brad may who he jumped on  doug mckee mckeecsbuffaloedu

  according to the hockey gurus over at espn should the islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record but the devils will be playing the penguins  this is because the islanders have won the season series against the devils  i think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include  0  season series 0  goals against 0  goals for  in this order correct me if im wrong  anyone have anything to add  craig  go islanders   
  djaraczozplymouthedu  writes  in article 00000000000dlmqccunyvmbitnet harold zazula dlmqccunyvmbitnet writes  i was watching the detroitminnesota game last night and thought i saw an  octopus on the ice after ysebaert scored to tie the game at two what gives    no no no  its a squid  keep the tradition alive  kinda like the  fish at unh games   actually the way i understand it it is an octapus apparently a number of years ago a fan threw an octapus on the ice and the announcer said octapi will not occupy the ice or something like that and its happened ever since  the fans cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands and boo those who use a shovel  matt at uva  
  if the islanders beat the devils tonight they would finish with identical records  whos the lucky team that gets to face the penguins in the opening round   also can somebody list the rules for breaking ties i am not sure about the tie breaker rules however i think if the islanders win oh god please please let them win the islanders win the series against  nj and advances to third   of course no one asked me i always interject my opinions on maters i have no concern over  go islanders i mean come on the jets were bad enough go jets for 00  
    in response to a debate about who has has a better season jagr of francis  i think jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time stats dont exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better      actually what i think has become more evident is that you are determined to   flaunt your ignorance at all cost  jagr did not have a better season than   francis  to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of   hockey knowledge  save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty   plusminus  it is the most misleading hockey stat available    until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice   time per game and some measure of its quality ie is the player put out   in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up   against the other teams top one or two lines shorthanded etc i would   much rather see the  disappear altogether instead of having its dubious   merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications   is a useful statistic  if a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals he must be doing something right it is especially useful to compare between teammates as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar  ratings if they are equally good players  it can be adjusted with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams  i agree it would be nice for the nhl to keep more statistics but how useful are the ones that you suggest  total ice time would be very useful it is a missing stat in jagr vs francis arguments from before  somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless  it would be a better stat for evaluating coaching ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones  a very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who doesnt recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player  this stat would be much more flawed than  and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent   is a useful stat  it is quite useful in evaluating player talent you are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing and should be evaluated as such  gregmeister  
   so if potvin can pound on dino what happens when dino pounds  on him  if dino gets his legs slashed can he slash potvin in return  this year at a umlssu hockey game a um player was called for a slash when he hit the goalies glove with his stick  is that slashing while hitting someones ankles isnt  how do the refs know what to call  do the goalies get more liberties than other players   brad

  what sadist brought up this vein about malarchuk  when i saw what happened i wanted to throw up and at the same time i was devastated since i thought that malarchuk wouldnt survive  btw i believe he picked up an alcohol problem after before the incident  to radically change the subject the caps must be having nightmares about the isles in overtime in the playoffs  have they ever beaten the islanders in a playoff ot game  this is lunacy  the caps are such a sorry team in the playoffs they consistently choke against opponents who they should be beating  losing two ot games in a row is not coincidence its evidence of the choke factor       keith kellerlets go rangers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs      in this cornerlets go quakers      weighing in at almost every weight imaginable          life and all that surrounds it      blues traveler 0000

       mario is the michael jordan of hockey  all that fucker has to do is fall     on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 0  last night in the     0rd game between nj and pitt he was being pushed while skating across the     front of the goal while trying to get a shot off  the guy on him was     doing a good job so he got off a weak shot but then he decided to fall     to the ice then the fucking refvan helloamend called the guy for     holding  they replayed the play and my roomatewho is clueless about     hockey wanted to know what the nj guy did to get a call because it was so fucking obvious the nj player     had both hands on his stick and no he did not trip him  it is simple     mario gets touched he falls to the ice automatic 0  but the thing that     really pissed me off is pitt scored the 0rd or 0th goal i dont remember     on the resulting pp and     eventually won 00  his divingcalls makes a huge difference in the     outcome of a game      all agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed      steve      we must have been watching two different games   the devil had one hand on marios elbow and pulling the elbow caused mario to fall so the call was appropriate  using clueless people to substantiate your claims doesnt give me a lot of confidence in your call either  next time consider getting a second opinion from a clueful observer  or maybe all those available disagreed        joseph stiehm

  drozinstdberauedu drozinski tim writes  as if an aluminum stick being taken to ulfs head is gonna solve the problem with violence in the sport of hockey  how the hell can you say the guy is a goon and justify it with your backassward mentality  saying that hurting a player will solve anyones problems is asinine  new rules and a new  referee system need to be instituted  right now too many of the real goons get away with too much because the ref is watching the play or supposed to beive seen koharski and van hellemond to name a few with their heads up their  asses on a few calls rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the  play  even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties it would be an improvement  unfortunately that is the way the league is heading you cant fight so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref isnt looking ulf has brought this to a high level players stuck in the past like neely who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system  lets face it a cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective method it is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way i dont like it but thats the way the league is going  by the way there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguindevil game managed to hit the nj player in the face with a stick must have been a legal hit after all ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do things like that   
   i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference next week while the exact details are not known it is believed to concern the oilers future  rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with copps collesium in hamilton during the press conference pocklington may announce the deal it is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium  northlands has offered to buy the oilers for 00 million earlier but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington  as for me my opinion is divided edmonton has been fairly supportive of the oilers even though theyre a small market team they had many sellouts in the 00s even with the problems that the team had this year they still brought in more fans than many teams in larger cities did on the other hand if the team does move there is no place more deserving than hamilton of course how would that affect the grand realignment scheme of bettman

  i watched the game germanyczechs in wc todayand i was astonished about the behaviour of the german audience the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went grazy they threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis that stupid or what i guess the canadian referee one of the isostarbros  gave the german team a penalty for that but it didnt help much i guess the germans just are proud over their nazikillemalleveryone butusgermanssucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude in every possible sport remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer it really pisses me off i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks but  most of them seem to do  jokke kylmaoja golfphoenixoulufi

  from dean in other tv news the penguins announced yesterday that they will have 0 fewer broadcast tv games and will have 00 games on some sort of subscription  payperview system yuck   this is incorrect  this year the pens had 00 games on free tv and 0 games on ppv  next year they will have 00 games on free tv and 00 on  a subscription basis     you actually get 0 more free game than last year and there will be no more radioonly games  yes youre right after going home and reading the paper i got the full details thats what i get for making a post based on wduqs news i should know by now they get just about every sports related item wrong  ralph   
        as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and doesnt know anything about him i dont know whether it is just this area pittsburgh of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether hes a canadian thing altogether  seriously what is he all about  i know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question is what is the deal with him  secondly are the comments of his that i read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him seriously  i gotta tell you from what i see he really sounds like an ass  let me know  maybe im missing something   
   i loved the abc coverage the production was excellent the appearance antonioyou werent alone  abc ratings were very good i was schocked to hear that abcs telecast was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend national rating came out to a very respectable 00 top00 nielsen markets were at 00 in bostonthe game scored lower at 00 but it had some competion from local sports teams quite frankly i expected abcs ratings to be under 00 but im happy to be proven wrong  wellwellsometimes it pays off clicking away on your cabletv remote control and if you happen to be a hockey fanyou could just stumble upon a playoff hockey game  espn picked up detroittoronto game on monday night because the only night game in mlb was being rained out in chicago you have to give espn credit for switching to detroits fox00 coverage and having bill clement at a pittsburghs tv stationwate for intermission analysis maybeespn people were giddy over perliminary overnight abc ratings for sundays telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion good moveespn   ppv mark

  showing a meaningless relatively baseball game over the overtime of game that was tied up with less than 0 seconds left on the clock gimme a break  where does espn get these brilliant decisions from   its called contractual obligations with major league baseball i wouldve liked to see the ot of the islescaps game but i understand where espn is coming from espn is committed to a single telecast a night and everything after that is a bonus  ppv mark

   its true that vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before  quinn came but in those years the smythe division was a loti mean a lot tougher division than the norris also known as the snorris division vancouver had to play edmonton and calgary both very legitimate stanley cup contenders eight times a year while detroit got to play such  powerhouses as toronto and minnesota  now edmonton is hardly even a force in the league and the smythe even has the mighty san jose sharks while  them thars fighting wordshardly a forcegeezmiss the playoffs once in 00 years and even after making the final four 0 times in the last five years and everyone thinks its doomsville  over this same period of time in which vancouver was improving so was  everybody in the norris except st louis  detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division  they had to improve a lot to get better than their competition in the norris  bryan murray inherited a team with very little talent  for really good players they had yzerman burr and probert and that was about it  and no doubt some will dispute whether burr and probert were that good the rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans  the only reason they got as far as they did in the years before murray came was due to the coaching of demers who at least at first got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team  then even his coaching began to degrade   fedorov primeau kozlov lidstrom sillinger konstantinov drake kennedy racine and cheveldae were already in the pipeline due to devellanomurray inherited these guysin addition to yzerman probert carson chiasson etc  there are a number of reasons why detroit wasnt in as bad a shape standings wise when murray took over as vanc was when quinn took over some of which i outlined above but murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did quinn with the exception of yzerman  and one player cannot alone make a team into a stanley cup contender as im sure everyone reading this will agree     noquinn had far lessmurray took over detroit at a time to  take advantage of all of devellanos good draftingif devellano had not given in to demers request to make the oates trade he might still be gm  gerald

  it was great to hear that umass is bringing back hockey  it reminded me that a couple of years ago there was talk that both bimidgi sp and mankato state trying to upgrade their programs to div 0 status  i also seem to remember that they had some trouble with new ncaa rule about just who was allowed to compete at the div 0 level  was that ever resolved  also i was just wondering if there is any college hockey east of colorado alaska excepted with the new popularity of hockey on the west coast i would expect there to be some interest building at the collegiate levels too anyone heard anything                       james old email joldvmaccndedu  
      tonight in boston the buffalo sabres blanked the boston bruins 00 tonight in boston looks like boston can hang this season up because buffalos home record is awesome this is great buffalo fans might get to see revenge for last year   im glad grant fuhr will never be as overconfident after two wins as you areit takes four wins to defeat an opponenteach tougher to obtain than the previous one  buffalo is off to a good start fuhr is proving the fuhrbashers wrong but boston is an awfully good team  gerald   
  could anyone post the game summary for the sabresbruins game  grant fuhr rules   gerald  
  in article lte00kinn0ulappservengsuncom mretealengsuncom mike eisler writes i dont think trading kisio was intrinsically a mistake however trading him for a 0rd round pick would be he should have been worth a lot more than a 0rd round pick for a playoff team  in fact i would intimate that the offers the sharks got this year for kisio were way greater than just a 0rd round pick  hindsights 0000 nobody expected kisio to have his 0nd best career year  besides without kisio the sharks would have tanked even earlier in the season and gund might have gotten a little more serious about getting joe murphy a guy who definitely would be around 0  0 years from now when the sharks do make the playoffs  what else could be done  the gunds offered 0 million for murphy but the oilers wanted prospects which the sharks declined to give which i think is correct  i didnt mean to imply that gunds offer wasnt enough  gunds offer was the right  but too late in the season  0m offered in november lets sather buy a replacement for murphy this season and make the playoffs this year 0m in march doesnt help sather with his immediate objectives doesnt help with long term objectives only a prospect or draft pick does and no way should the sharks do that however getting back to whatif games had kisio been traded to chicago last year then the sharks go 0 for october and maybe gund panicks sooner in november and heres another whatif twist chicago would have had kisio this season they never go after murphy in the first place because kelly is having his best season bigger guys in chicago so gund has no competition so ferriera sather and keenan all look like geniuses  a broken fax machine and ferriera keenan and maybe kingston and maybe even green lose their jobs kind of makes you shiver doesnt it   bottomline for every black scenario any of you can concoct for kisio leaving i can concoct an equally bright one  if the kisiofiasco was the cause of ferierras down fall i hope it wasnt because he tried to trade kisio but because he screwed it up nonetheless im sorry ferierra and kingston are gone and i wish gund would follow  and what have the gunds done exactly that caused you to wish that they were gone   are you serious  let ferierra go  fire kingston these last two basically mean that sharks are starting over again in terms of the timetable to capture the cup as ive stated frequently 0 out 0 expansion teams had the same gm from inception through cup season   broadcast more home games than away games  broadcast very few road pacific and mountain time games  jack up my ticket prices from 00 to 00 in two years not that im going to pay 000 bucks for 0 seats ill probably next to the virtual 000 folks   not tell me my priority   not let me sell my priority   in order for me to get the free jacket force me to order my tickets for next season before i get to select my section   not let me park at the new arena after paying for their privileged parking lot which was sometimes full when i got there for 0 straight years  ive been a loyal ticket holder since day 0 literally in spring of 00 when the team was announced  and im not getting that loyalty returned wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison and pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all  go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in edmonton  i know one isnt suppose to make negative comments on signatures but what did us oiler fans do to you to deserve the stay in edmonton part id never wish the kings to leave metrola its too much fun watching the sharks beat them   mike eisler mreengsuncom  not only are they leafs the best team but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburghs  their  players are mighty bright too  i mean he really was going to get his  wallet back right jan brittenson 000 on leafpen woofers in  recsporthockey

   i knew despite the lack of a full game telecast last week it was still too much hockey for atlanta atlantas abc has declined to pick up any playoff games till may0 and even when they show the games on may0 and may00 they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast i know this is still a better situation compared to rest of georgia alabama etc but it is still pretty annoying at least in pittsburgh we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate   i asked them what their problem was i told them that a local 00 rating was not that bad considering it was the first nhl game shown after a long time without much promotion besides their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated so what did they have to lose by showing nhl playoffs she told me that they had contractual obligations i asked her if golf was shown oin abc would contractual obligations come in the way and how come contractual obligations didnt come in the way of last weeks telecast she then couldnt give me a coherent answer   also i added that atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game attendances and that the demographics were good i think abc and other networks should begin to tie their high rated programs like roseanne in with  thier sports programming i hope that everyone in atlanta who reads this bboard calls wsb 0 and complain bitterlyt about this tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation  the lady did not seem to settle on a single reason sometimes the reason is low ratings then another time she says contractual obligations  
   while watching the penguinsdevils game last night i saw the slash that barrasso took on the neck  this brought to mind the goaltender who had his jugular vein cut by a skate  i think he was a sabre but im not positive does anyone rememberknow his name  what has happened to him since  what about the player whose skate cut the goalie  name  info  has this ever happened before in a hockey game     thanks  carol go pens  his name is clint malarchuk  im not sure what he does now but ive heard hes an extra in slasher films  brian   
    ok i know i look pretty desperate on this bboard i think i have posted 0 or 0 messages already on the issue of nhl telecats over the last few weeks but hey i am pretty desperate what i am interested is not just a sportsbar with multiple screens so thast i can watch the game on one of those silent screens are there any hockey oriented bars in this area or does some patrick division or adams division fan have a satellite dish i dont mind paying an admission fee if necessary  
        as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and doesnt know anything about him i dont know whether it is just this area pittsburgh of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether hes a canadian thing altogether  seriously what is he all about  i know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question is what is the deal with him  secondly are the comments of his that i read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him seriously  i gotta tell you from what i see he really sounds like an ass  let me know  maybe im missing something   for those of you who complain about don cherry and wonder why he is popular  the reply is dick vitale and john madden and bobby knight and joe garagiola and howard cosell  john madden picks gary clark of the redskins for his allmadden team a lot over much better receiversfor much the same reasons cherry sings the praises of doug gilmoura little guy with heartyet one doesnt see a string of american posts saying that john madden has lost his marbles  dick vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or that college with outrageous statements  why should americans expect that canada would not have such characters in relation to our greatest passionwhich is hockey   canadians are very similar to americansculturally our sports are just hockey and curling whereas with americans it is footballbasketballbaseball and bowling  gerald  
  however bowman is really not a modern coach and patricks solution of having him only run the team on game days and delegate most of the daytoday responsibity to the assistants is a shrewd managerial decision on patricks part    i would argue gerald that bowman is the first modern coach bowmans canadiens were the first nhl team to have a weightroom in the 00s  he is the first coach i have seen that manipulates the press into spreading false game plan rumours  during important games listen to the pregame interview will bowman and compare that to what is on the ice  i agree bowman is a master of the lineups  remember last year in the sc when he benched jagr only to set him free  in ot  when jagr banged in the winning goal i thought this was trademark bowman and also a sign of a modern coach  i am left asking what is a modern coach if not bowman  jake   
   paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the nhl we was robbed  no  patrick roy is the reason the game was lost and ron hextall is the reason quebec won   i dont buy this at all roy was the reason the game was tied and that would not have been the case had dionne kept his cool  roy stood on his  head for the first 00 minutes of the game when the nords were rushing from  endtoend kamenskys minibreak after the tying goal and the first shot by  young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy roy outplayed  hextall for most of the game but roy becomes the villain and hextall  the hero because roys team didnt make full use of their opportunities  whoa  what you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well he stores up mistakes that can be used at a later time  ths is not so  roy is the villain as you so succinctly put it because he allowed a very cheap goal  if you think roy outplayed hextall perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first 00 minutes of the third period  nhl goaltenders make some great saves  if they did not they would not be in the nhl in the first place  i do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time even though they are occasionally required  however when it comes to a routine shot like sakics especially at such a crucial time in a game i dont think there  are any legitimate excuses   hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces  description of lucky bounces hextall wasnt particularly brilliant on those plays    i am not arguing that hextall was brilliant  i am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result  in a goal     but it was just the 0 goal the timing stank but against an explosive team like quebec they gave them 0 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary  in a onegoal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as just the 0 goal  i have not defended dionne for taking the penalty eitherin fact i think it was a boneheaded move  but it led to one goal only and montreal had a two goal lead  my main concern is the second  goal  this most certainly was a team loss leclair missed his opportunities as did bellows and brunet dionne took a bad penalty damphousse and lebeau were silent carbonneau and savard were a step behind all night roy gave up the bad goal roy by no means can be singled out for this loss  what you say about the skaters is absolutely true  but realize that the  game was effectively won  you could watch any hockey game in fact you could watch any sporting event period and spend hours discussing the what ifs wrt missed opportunities  they are not important when the final result is decided  if i get the time soon ill watch the game again and email you a list of lucky montreal bounces and a list of quebec offensive screwups  montreal was leading with a minute to go  the goalie is the last line of defence and i will grant that extra attention is focussed on him sometimes without justification  but roy gave up a lousy goal and a team cannot afford such a goal  roy looked like a player in an industrial league on sakics shot  and hextall didnt on dionnes goal please   who cares  of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play  i could do a hextall critique if youd like  but if youre going to assess his performance keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times  roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies  and he still is in the top 0  for the record i did not say that roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league  in fact i agree that he is  the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the habs they are no better than uninformed fans                              i assume you are referring to me  however i have pointed out that i think the loss can be blamed on roy  i have not said he sucks nor do i think ive made any other derogatory comments  if you regard objective and informed fyi observations as derogatory i really cant help you    dchhabrastplistsca    
  vergolini writes   ok buffalo fans  i am a red wings fan but am amazed at how the sabres are beating up on the bruins  is there any reason for this  is it grant fuhr or mogilny and lafontaine  i would like to hear from you since i do not know much about the sabres                                                      dave vergolini                                                 michigan state university                                                 vergolineulerlbsmsuedu  pure and simple grant fuhr is money  he has been awesome in the playoffs especially last night  but mogilny has been scoring well and his russian friend kymlev sp has also done well  but fuhr is the biggest reason they are winning and the difference between this years team and previous years  bill perry   
  allan sullivan allancsualbertaca wrote   unfortunately that is the way the league is heading you cant fight  so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when  the ref isnt looking ulf has brought this to a high level players  stuck in the past like neely who prefer fights to cheap shots  are at a disadvantage in the new system   lets face it a cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective  method it is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of  causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way i dont  like it but thats the way the league is going   by the way there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguindevil  game managed to hit the nj player in the face with a stick must have been a  legal hit after all ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do  things like that  are there any ex nhl hockey players out there who might care to comment on this and end this ridiculously long discussion    tom huot                huotcraycom

  get off espns back and stop posting articles on this subject there have been to many fn complainers about this game that its making me sick  generally i agree with you however 0 last night espn cut away to baseball tonite which looks like sportscenter tailored to baseball and they cut away at 000 pacific thats quite a contract they have there 0 if espn couldnt deliver they should have had a transistion plan to let sportschannel pick up the slack  nonetheless it is ultimately the fault of the usamerican public that regular season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the us support your team support your game  somebody in rsh had an excellent idea that we should write chrysler to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would consider their products heres an equally excellent idea watch baseball for 00 minutes i know im asking a lot but thats what spew bags are for write down who is advertising and write them letters complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and that you wont consider buying their products because of it   mike eisler mreengsuncom  not only are they leafs the best team but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburghs  their  players are mighty bright too  i mean he really was going to get his  wallet back right jan brittenson 000 on leafpen woofers in  recsporthockey  
    the goalie to whom you refer is clint malarchuk  he was at that time playing with the sabres  his team immediately prior to that was the washington capitals  while he did recover and continue to play i do not know his present whereabouts  
  just some thoughts  i dont usually like to post simply to make fun of a player but this time i couldnt resist  during the pensdevils game last night second period i think kevin stevens was in the penalty box nicholls punched kjell samuellson in the face then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself  all kjell could do at 00 and 000 pounds was laugh  and speaking of swedish penguins defensemen ulf is getting a little out of hand lately  his cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent  as everybody in the meadowlands except for the officials could see last night he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the devils throat  ive always supported the argument he does his job by being irritating but hes starting to push it over the edge imho  of course holiks chop to barrassos neck wasnt too sportsmanlike either it seems that he was following the the only way to beat the penguins is to injure them philosophy  as my modern drama professor pointed out to me the other day jagr was stoned pretty well tuesday night and last night as well although the 00 seconds he danced around the devils end was pretty exciting  matt at uva  
  mom writes i fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team left in pittsburgh will be the steelers  perish the thoughtbut you know you may be right at least as far as major league professional sports teams go  they all seem to be becoming big money games much more so than at any previous time  to think that if i am ever able to move back home several years from now all that may be there is an ahl team at bestsigh  the interesting thing is that the nhl is also expanding at the same time as it is dramatically increasing the amount of money needed to operate a team  this would seem to indicate that theres a big shakeout about to occur in the next few years unless player salaries can somehow be brought under control  frankly i dont see how the nhls current drive for expansion is supportable under its current operating conditions  if revenue sharing and a salary cap dont come into the nhl soon look out steve  
  i hadnt heard about this new espn0 when is this new network supposed to start sounds great to me as long as my cable co  offers it   hopefully epsn will use the lesson given by the master ted turner the season ted introduced tnt many cable cos refused to put it on saying that gee we get enough old movies miniseries etc on tbs usa amc wgn wor why do we need another one this was in the fall come spring ted fixed their little red wagons good the previous spring nba playoffs wore on tbs now they were on tnt and still are and everyone gets tnt now  so espn should put nfl football and baseball on espn0 and leave hockey on espn and if cable cos play games and drop espn in favor of espn0 espn should alternate baseball and football between channels every week  but do the espn guys collectively have the gonads of the turner guy   mike eisler mreengsuncom  not only are they leafs the best team but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburghs  their  players are mighty bright too  i mean he really was going to get his  wallet back right jan brittenson 000 on leafpen woofers in  recsporthockey

   in the boston area you can hear the rangers on wfan and the devils on wabc the whalers on wtic and the red wings on wjr this of course is in addition to the bruins who are currently on weei but may move to whdh because the fools at weei are owned by the celtics and thus will show them over the bruins every time there is a conflict you can also get wbal baltimore but i dont think they have hockey btw i once got a station from indiana that had fort wayne comets games  
   showing a meaningless relatively baseball game over the overtime of  game that was tied up with less than 0 seconds left on the clock  what actually happened  after the pens game i turned to espn and the game was nearly at the end of regular then the phone rang  i turened off the  tv  later when i turned it back on the indians were on  then a little later the hockey games was on again then the baseball game what was actually on  not that it matters any more but some hockey was in deed on

  all these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at njd they are a very deep team with two very capable goalies and excellent forwards and defensemen  shooter in richer an all around do it all in todd chef stasnymaster of a thousand dishes power play captainstevens  take a look at the numbers or play with them and see for yourselves  
  way back in the early years 00s it took 0 wins to garner the stanley cup  soooooo a couple of local fish mongers local to the joe louis arena that is started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win  after each victory one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the ice  they are dead by the way  it was a brilliant marketing strategy to shore up the demand for one of their least popular products  hope this helps  j lange

  can the sabres win two more games against the bruins  i think game three in buffalo will be the most important of the series  if the sabres lose that game the party will be over  it will  be hello next year  the key for the remaining games in the series will be whether fuhr can keep up his brillliant goaltending and if mogilny can continue skate by  the bruins  he has shown demonstrated excellent speed  finally the sabres appear to have shown up for the post season       sabresbills fan

  hooray i hear on tsn that the jets have won a game selanne getting a hattrick  of course here in gods country read ontario i couldnt see that game nor any other in the vanwpg series so far because our beloved cbc figures no one out here cares about this series which has looked pretty competitve so far  on monday and wednesday nights cbc could have shown the toronto detroit game done the news then picked up winnipegvancouver they didnt  tonight  you guessed it torontodetroit the news not the end of the jets game then calgaryla  so if its hockey night in canada why cant this ontarian see one of the two series with two canadian teams  is this too much to ask  paul badertscher 000000000uwovaxuwoca

  according to the hockey gurus over at espn should the islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record but the devils will be playing the penguins  this is because the islanders have won the season series against the devils  i think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include  0  season series 0  goals against 0  goals for  in this order correct me if im wrong  anyone have anything to add   i thought it was 0 wins 0 goals for  gerald

       as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and doesnt know anything about him i dont know whether it is just this area pittsburgh of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether hes a canadian thing altogether  seriously what is he all about  i  hes a canadian thing former coach of the boston bruins and colorado rockies from the summaries that get posted i gather that his ongoing beef this year has been the conventional wisdom that canadian hockey is doomed to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the us and european programs  know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question is what is the deal with him  secondly are the comments of his that i  after he left the rockies he got a job with cbcs hockey night in canada and hasnt looked back since actually he did work for cbc at least on playoff season after the rockies were eliminated  read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him seriously  i gotta tell you from what i see he really sounds like an  id say its a combination of flame bait and serious journalism the closest thing youll find to cherry in the us is stan fischler a selfdescribed hockey maven the similarities are that they both say things that get people upset the difference is that cherry knows the game and fischler doesnt  ass  let me know  maybe im missing something  dons a character if he were completely rational and noncontroversial he wouldnt have a job by some definitions he could be called an ass but then some people feel the same about mike lang another character that i wish would get wider exposure only one national telecast last year   mike eisler mreengsuncom  not only are they leafs the best team but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburghs  their  players are mighty bright too  i mean he really was going to get his  wallet back right jan brittenson 000 on leafpen woofers in  recsporthockey

  st         as for more captain trivia the next edmonton st         catain was lee fogilin who was later traded to st         the buffalo sabres after him was wayne gretzky st         who w   traded to l a then came kevin low who st         nly this year was traded to the n y rangers   wasnt mark messier captain of the oilers before kevin lowe but of course he was traded as well  so your point of every oilers captain being traded is still true   stephen legge sleggekeanucsmunca   
   so all us hockeyautomobile racing fans all know exactly where we stand espn delays the martinsville race by a day for the nfl draft espn shows baseball instead of the overtime of a nhl playoff game  gimme a break guys    does anyone know why this race is tape delay especially until monday   is this the weekend for the nfl draft   if so postponing the race for a day is   a real slap in the face for racing fans   im afraid youre right as usual as i recall theyve been doing this   ever since they started covering the draft live i wish they could work   out some kind of a deal with somebody else such as tnn to get the race   on live but i guess espn isnt much into sharing it also clarifies   where auto racing stands on their priority list as if we didnt already   know     charlie shub  cdashcscoloradoedu       or         000 0000000      on leave at the university of iowa  cdashcsuiowaedu 000 0000000

   interestingly keenans cocoach or is it his number one on team canada at the world championships is roger neilsen     but ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the initiative within the limits of his systemwhile roger has a reactive hockey philosophywhich is why messier will be able to and has played for keenan but thought rogers way was a sure loser  itd be interesting if the rangers call in the balance of neilsens contract to be keenans assistant   roger did do a very good job with the mediocre players just as he handled the cinderella canucks of 00 years ago  but his mistake was playing the rangers like those canucks last may    roger is a great assistant coachbut considering what must be bad blood between nielson and messier it would be a mistake to bring him back even in that role  gerald  
  losers like us you are the fucking moron who has never heard of the western business school or the university of western ontario for that matter why  dont you pull your head out of your asshole and smell something other than shit for once so you can look on a map to see where uwo is back to hockey the north stars should be moved because for the past few years they have just been shit a real team like toronto would never be moved  not only have i not heard of the western business school or the university of western ontario ive never even wondered if there was a western ontario  and judging by the quality of the posts coming from there im still not sure that the place exists  perhaps i should be impressed though since it appears that grade school children in that area have access to the internet  rick  
  william k willis ww0aandrewcmuedu writes        as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and doesnt know anything about him i dont know whether it is just this area pittsburgh of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether hes a canadian thing altogether  seriously what is he all about  i know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question is what is the deal with him  secondly are the comments of his that i read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him seriously  i gotta tell you from what i see he really sounds like an ass  let me know  maybe im missing something  from his topps rookie year as coach card 0000 for the past couple of seasons don has been the highlysuccessful  coach of the rochester americans of the ahl but he is getting his  first shot at an nhl job with the bruins  named coach of the year  in the ahl the last two years and he aims to make the bruins a  rough team again as they were a couple of years back  although  he played 00 seasons of professional hockey don never played a  regularseason nhl game  he did appear in one playoff game for  boston in 000000  dons brother dick played two seasons in the  nhl with boston and philadelphia      mark mckinzie              listen if theyre going to buy lunch boxes mckinziemathwiscedu  they might as well buy david cassidy lunch boxes uw dept of mathematics madison wi 00000                        david cassidy

     i watched the game germanyczechs in wc todayand i was astonished about  the behaviour of the german audience  the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went  it was not just those penalties most of all it was the penalty the referee didnt call on the czechs right before their first goal   grazy they threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis  that stupid or what i guess the canadian referee one of the  isostarbros  gave the german team a penalty for that but it didnt help  much  i guess the germans just are proud over their nazikillemalleveryone  dont you think its quite silly to call it a nazi attitude when some people  throw coins on the ice hey i dont approve the behavior of these guys especially not in a wc game but i cant see any reason for using the word nazi in this connection      butusgermanssucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude  in every possible sport remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer  soccer hooligans are not just a german problem remember the world cup in italy again theres a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shopwindows or fighting with other socalled fans who come to a wc just to see if the dutch or the english or the germans are the best bruisers which other sports are you talking about i dont think soccer is every possible sport   it really pisses me off  i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks but   most of them seem to do  how many germans do you know do you think 000 out of 00000 is most of them  if you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the us what do you think about the americans most of them like beating blacks     jokke kylmaoja  golfphoenixoulufi      robert  
    id like to see some playoff games since im stuck in buffalo at ub but i think boston isnt giving up so easy  no boston probably wont go down easy but if the sabres hadnt won game one buffalo would have been out in four  and what problem are you having with playoff games here in buffalo theres the sabresbruins quebecmontreal and whatever espn and abc show and on opposite nights theres torontodetroit and whatever espnabc shows  more hockey than a good chunk of north america either side of the border  its wonderful and there are thousands of folks whod kill to be in your shoes coveragewise       valerie hammerl        john sr would lift pat over the boards grab  hammerlacsubuffaloedu       his hand and start running around the outside v000pwpzubvmsccbuffaloedu  faster and faster  i wanted to learn how to  get that feeling and the only way was to learn how to skate  p lafontaine  
  what about including points  probably no goals at least against opponents but there have been several assists given         ian neath         there are four kinds of people in this world neathpsychpurdueedu  cretins fools morons and lunatics  u eco  
  help  im stuck here at a computer in new jersey and have no access to a radio or tv  could someone kindly post the score of the canucksjets game  thanks in advance  mark  
  is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad  i cant remember how many times during the penguinsdevils game they showed some guy without the puck being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal  in fact i think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner  now the last time i watched a football game they didnt show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown       is it just me  greg   
   nluxenonstanfordedu nelson lu writes  00dody woodseason 0st  acquired0rd round pick in 0000 entry draft  gradei dd although perhaps i shouldnt give a grade at all    i have been accused of knocking on wood too much    you nah     he was seriously unimpressive even as a tough guy his rep however as  few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless i hate  to judge the talent too quickly butn in dodys case im tempted to make an  exception    but i wont  wood played most of his junior career in seattle  he was one of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in 0000  he rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in the whl  however i was extremely surprised when he was drafted especially in the third round  he certainly didnt look like nhl material   paul brownlow         visualize  data io corp  redmond wa   whirled pauldataiocom    peas   
   tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov i think thats it or a       defenseman rob niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong  rob niedermayer is a forward center i think with the whl medicine hat tigers  his brother scott is a defenseman now with the nj devils   paul brownlow         visualize  data io corp  redmond wa   whirled pauldataiocom    peas   
   okay heres some gripeing griping whatever  i live in santa barbara for reference i think  okay abc showed the kingsflames fine yawn  espn through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the   red wingstoronto game cool  but i swear that the advertisements all week long had said that   espn would show pittnj on tuesday and bosbuff on thursday  i raced home from work early 000 pacific to catch the game but   alas it was the bostonbuffalo game and then they promised that they would   show the pittnj game on thursday  overnight they changed their mind  i didnt mind that much  i watched the game hockey is much better   than no hockey  during the game their were no video highlights from the   patrick division  what the hell was going on  at least they should show   video highlights of the other games especially the nyicaps game that was   so close  my father lives in bowling green kentucky bumbfck egypt   got to watch the pens game on espn  i just dont get it  the biggest problem is that buffalo or boston fans who didnt want   to see the pittsburghnew jersey game 0 will turn on their tvs on thursday   and see the pittsburghnew jersey game 0 instead of the buffaloboston game   0  at least in my case i just had to wait 0 more days to see my game  if i were a big boston or buffalo fan and i missed the game on   tuesday due to false advertising on the part of espn id be mad as   hell  oh well hopefully well get better coverage next year or   something  matt coohill  ps  the announcers for the buffaloboston were the worst that i have ever heard as far emotion goes  they had the enthusiasm of droopy dog  i hope for better on thursday  
  it is meaningless to compare one players plusminus statistic with another players out of the context of the role and the playing time of the players involved      to compare jagrs and franciss plusminus is ridiculous and absurd  gerald   
  way back in the early years 00s it took 0 wins to garner the stanley cup  soooooo a couple of local fish mongers local to the joe louis arena that is started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win  after each victory one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the ice  they are dead by the way  it was a brilliant marketing strategy to shore up the demand for one of their least popular products  hope this helps  j lange   local to the joe louis arena you mean local to olympia stadium where red wings games were played until fairly recently early 00s comes to mind as far as i know the rest of the post is basically correct if what you meant by local was simply detroit and im being incredibly picky okay sorry about that    david nichols        senior statistical support specialist         spss inc  phone 000 0000000     internet  nicholsspsscom     fax 000 0000000   any correlation between my views and those of spss is strictly due to chance

  i have been to all 0 islescaps tilts at the crap centre this year all isles wins and there is no justification for vukota and pilon to play for the isles vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world he couldnt hit a bull in the ass with a banjo al must remember a few years back when mick  scored 0 goals in one period against the caps in a 00 isles win i was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd wakeup al years later hes gotten worse hes a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupidsenseless penalties i think he would make a good police officier  as for pilon he cant carry the puck out to center ice by himself he either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover or he attempts to bring the puck  towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater he cant stay on his skates with most forwards or centers he either falls down or  committs a penalty call up somebody from capital district al  as far as the playoffs the isles are as difficult to figure out as the caps two good teams with talent but so inconsistent they should meet in the first round the isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against jersey tonite itll probably be another tight 0goal game as the last 00 games hve been for the isles i wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game al must understand he cant do with this team what he did with the 0000 isles maybe al should got to where is bobby nystrom clark gilles john tonelli these are the kind of young minds we need behing the bench    fire al  john scialdone scialdonenssdcagsfcnasagov  when your ship comes in first man takes the sail

  you should be ashamed to call yourself an ulf samuelson fan anybody who plays the way he does does not belong in the nhl there have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game but a lot of them have been talanted players bobby clarke kenny linsemen pie mckenzie chris chelios etc but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as ulf violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like should have been a women samuelson dont belong when players like ulf whos main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue and the league wont stop it the players should a christian pro 0000 aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely if the bruins get a chance to meet pittsburgh in the near future you can bet neely will have his day the sight of watching ulf turtle up like the coward he is is worth almost as much as a stanely cup this wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game if you are to remove ulf samuelson from the lineup the penguins would not even notice hes gone hes an eyesore on the game of hockey   rich

  brad gibson gibsonnuktageopubcca wrote  much text deleted     plusminus  it is the most misleading hockey stat available  not necessarily the most misleading but you are right it definitely needs to be taken in the proper perspective a shining example is if you look at the penguins individual  you will find very few minuses that only makes common sense since they didnt lose many games     until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice    time per game and some measure of its quality ie is the player put out    in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up    against the other teams top one or two lines shorthanded etc i would    much rather see the  disappear altogether instead of having its dubious    merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications  unfortunately you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to really come up with a statistic which really shows a players value lets just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it like im doing now excuse me    tom huot                huotcraycom

  i cant believe that the ny rangers would force its  players to go to binghamtom to play in the ahl playoffs instead of letting them represent their countries in the world championships  anderrson and zubov are waiting for the nhl to make a decision to this while kovalev has given in and gone down to the minors  the rangers are a disgrace  ps it has been reported that neil smith was very much against the hiring of mike keenan how long will smith be in ny for  the godfather

  00000    blues shutout hawks again lead series 00  it was a great atmosphere last night at the st louis arena as joseph and the blues shutout the hawks for the second consecutive game people were cheering the blues long before faceoff time and they kept going for the entire game my friends and i went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players heres a game summary from the st louis postdisptach enjoy  by dave luecking of the postdispatch staff  at 0000 pm friday night the arena crowd of 00000 paid homage to blues goalie curtis joseph the fans began bowing their arms extended taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read only god saves more than joseph  it was a fitting tribute to joseph who has brought the blues to the verge of a surprising sweep  joseph recorded his second successive shutout friday blanking the blackhawks 00 in game 0 of the norris division semifinals and giving the blues a 00 lead in the bestofseven series  the blackhawks havent scored against joseph since the 000 mark of the second period of game 0 joseph has shut out the blackhawks for 000 minutes 0 seconds a blues record jacques plante held the previous record of 00000 set in the first round of the 0000 playoffs against the philadelphia flyers one of only two series the blues have sweeped in their history  the blues can wrap up their first sweep since 0000 with a victory in game 0 a nationally televised game that begins at noon sunday the blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history both in 0000 when they swept philadelphia and los angeles en route to the stanley cup finals  the shutout friday was easier than on wednesday in game 0 when joseph had to make 00 saves this time the blues held the shots down to 00 and the blackhawks couldnt touch joseph  well they touched joseph numerous times shoving him and pushing him at  every opportunity to try to get him off his game but joseph and the blues were unfazed dishing out their own punishment along the way  the blues grinders  bob bassen rich sutter kevin miller and dave lowry  wore down the blackhawks taking the visitors from chicago off their game the grinders set the stage for the glamour boys the gifted playmakers and scorers who made the most of their opportunities  craig janney brett hull and nelson emerson scored getting one goal in each period hull assisted on janneys firstperiod power play goal after two unwise chicago penalties checker miller set up hulls goal in the second period and rookie denny felsner assisted for emerson who scored at 0000 of the final  period  blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling sweep sweep sweep they also taunted chicago goalie ed belfour  bellfour bellfour they also chanted na nanana heyhey good bye  such talk is a tad premature theres still one game left but the blues are on a roll they have the blackhawks on their heels  the blues set the tone early on friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play rich sutter leveled bryan marchment and brendan shanahan dumped steve smith at center ice  chicago tried to retaliate but troy murrays decision to run into joseph backfired referee dan marouelli gave him a roughing penalty  the blues didnt get a shot on goal on the power play and they survived a scare after chicago killed the penalty when rick zombo gave the puck away to steve larmer joseph stopped larmers shot and everything else chicago threw at him in the first period the hawks ignored the scouting report on joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low where josephs butterfly style is deadly  rookie bret hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period  two for hooking and one for holding  but chicago got only two shots on goal as many as miller the blues penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against belfour   marouelli began calling penalties on the blackhawks to even things up he caught brent sutter hooking shanahan four seconds after hedicans third penalty he called marchment for elbowing janney along the boards at 0000 and gave the blues a twoman advantage 000 later when christian ruuttu slashed shanahan  the blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play and hull got it where he likes it  in the high slot hulls shot hit belfours right shoulder and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line belfour dived back to cover but the puck squirted loose to janney who poked it into the net at 0000 for his first goal of the playoffs  the blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended and the blackhawks lost their composure joe murphy tripped ron wilson with two seconds remaining in the period and after time had expired smith upset the blues by shooting the puck into the blues bench  chris chelios made a move toward joseph as the teams left the ice and marouelli slapped him with a 00minute misconduct chicago survived the blues power play but the loss of chelios hurt he didnt return until the midway point of the period and within three minutes of his return hull had increased the blues lead to 00 deflecting in millers crisp pass  try as they might the blackhawks couldnt get to joseph who stopped everything they could throw at him he stopped 00 shots in the second period and 00 more in the third chicago also hit the goalpost twice  emersons goal put the game away he went hard to the net and redirected felsners pass                                          a l l e z   l e s   b l u e s

   the flyers blew a 00 lead over the buffalo sabres in the second period but kevin dineens 0th career hat trick powered them to their 0th consecutive win 00 over the sabres who have now lost 0 in a row alexander mogilny led the comeback scoring his 00th and 00th goals of the season which tied the game at 0 in the 0nd period and 0 in the 0rd tommy soderstrom stopped 00 of 00 shots on goal to improve his own record to 00000 as he was tested by mogilny and lafontaine all night  roster move  andre faust was once again recalled from hershey shawn cronin was a healthy scratch  lines  eklundlindrosrecchi beranekbrindamourdineen lomakinbutsayevconroy faustactonbrown  galleybowen yushkevichhawgood carknermcgill  tommy soderstrom  game summary  say if anybody from buffalo is reading this where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems we had to turn down the volume  the flyers defense started out the game showing everybody why the flyers have been shutting teams out lately by holding the sabres to only 0 shots in the first period they then showed everybody why they will be playing golf sunday when they gave up 00 shots in the last two periods maybe tommy told them that he was getting bored back there  mark recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it after buffalo won the faceoff and dumped tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to eric 00 way up on his left eric dropped it to galley and he sent it ahead to recchi steaming out of the zone mark skated into the center circle passed the puck to himself through the legs of richard smehlik skated around him and in on fuhr smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to the right past fuhr for a 00 flyers lead at 000 it was so beautiful eric and garry should turn down their assists   the flyers kept the pressure on fuhr for a while after that but he was strong and kept the flyers from doing further damage the game then became a defensive struggle for a while the sabres got the first chance on the power play when terry carkner took a boarding minor at 0000 for crunching dale hawerchuk into the boards in the flyers zone lafontaine got the only scoring chance and not a terribly good one as the flyers smothered the sabres power play mogilny got a post after it was over the 00th consecutive penalty kill for the flyers  keith carney took a holding penalty at 0000 for taking down mark recchi to give the flyers a power play the best penalty killing team in the league didnt allow the flyers a shot on goal although the flyers did create a good scoring chance for lindros who partially fanned on his shot towards the end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody kept missing the net greg hawgood took an interference penalty at 0000 to give the sabres another power play but they couldnt get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck shots were 00 buffalo after the flyers had led 00 at one point  mike emrick interviewed flyers president jay snider between periods jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs but not discouraged this was considered a rebuilding year after the trade and he seemed very happy with the way the season went when asked if he agonized over the trade he said that it was russ farwells trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and ed snider as far as the money but yes there was some agonizing and theyd do it all over again when asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that its russ call and russ will evaluate things at the end of the season he feels that theyre 0 years away from a shot at the cup he expects to get into the playoffs next year have a shot at a division title the following year and a shot at the finals the year after that this based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer  hes very happy with the realignment he called it outstanding happy with the current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable seemed to like the idea of playing in the olympics booo but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus  the sabres gave the flyers their second power play of the game when brad may took a tripping penalty at 000 of the second the flyers had a little trouble getting started but eventually did hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to eklund just outside the sabres blue line along the right boards eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle he half fanned on it and sent the puck trickling through the slot fuhr didnt know where it was though and hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 000  then mogilny on a breakaway he slipped through two flyers at the blue line and went in on soderstrom he went with the backhander but soderstrom was all over it  the flyers then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them viacheslav butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to gary dornhoefer took a dive to get the other there was no video at 000 the sabres coudlnt get started ryan mcgill poked at the puck just after a sabre carried into the flyers zone and after a bunch of people poked at it dineen emerged with it and headed the other way it started out a 0 on 0 but brindamour hustled ahead to make it a 0 on 0 and back off the defenseman dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 00 flyers at 000 that was all for fuhr john muckler sent in dominik hasek to take over  but the sabres still had lots of power play time again they took some time to just get into the flyers zone and when they finally did the flyers were all over them boos began to ring through the building but they finally got through soderstrom on an ugly goal smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to hawerchuk in the slot hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as galley dove down to block it mistake 0 he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about a the rebound or b barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net well the rebound dropped right next to soderstrom and mistake 0 galley just laid there and watched barnaby get three hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie he didnt even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away with the goal at 000 two streaks end for the flyers 00000 of shutout hockey and 00 straight penalty kills  lindros put them right back on the power play at 000 with a high sticking minor i think it was barnaby again this time the sabres were able to get set up quickly but couldnt get too much quality on goal the sabres continued to keep the puck in the flyers end for a while after the power play ended things evetually settled down but then the other very bad penalty mcgill allowed barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff the gloves were dropped and mcgill started pounding the crap out of him but during the fight he gave barnaby a head butt with his helmet and that meant a match penalty 0 for slashing 0 fighting and 0 for the major 0 minutes of power play time for the sabres at 0000 barnaby only got 0  the flyers were keeping them at bay for a while but there was only so long they could do that after a couple of good sabre chances audette handed to ledyard at the point and ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by soderstrom lafontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net and knocked it over to randy wood at the right soderstrom had moved over to play lafontaine and since yushkevich and carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men wood just slid it into the empty net at 0000 to close the flyers lead to 00 lafontaine was actually trying to put it on net but half fanned on it and got a break  the flyers then got some shorthanded pressure in the sabres zone but hasek was strong finally it was keith carney passing ahead to hawerchuk into the neutral zone and hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to mogilny at the flyers blue line another minibreakaway for mogilny he elected to shoot from the left circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 0000 for his 00th of the season ironically the youth hockey tip between the 0st and second period was tommy soderstrom talking about cutting off angles  that was all in the 0nd shots were 000 sabres  into the 0rd period and pelle eklund blew a golden opportunity to get the flyers the lead back a 0 on 0 acton with the puck he dropped to eklund in the slot and eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from when he finally did shoot he hit the far post that was still during the carryover power play time  than an incredible almost goal randy wood skated around recchi and hawgood untouched into soderstrom soderstrom goes down wood pokes the puck under soderstrom and a black object hits the back of the net red light comes on horn sounds crowd cheers but up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing well it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net not the puck emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net  dave hannan then took out recchi and got a holding minor at 000 the flyers could not get anything going at all they finally got set up 00 way through but were kept on the perimeter as time ran out beranek stripped the puck from a sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to eklund at the top of the left circle eklund saw dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him dineen fumbled the pass but twice directed it at hasek and eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 00th at 000 00 flyers  but the sabres came right back lafontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to bob erry behind the flyers net erry started to skate out but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net mogilny flew in skated around and stuffed it through soderstroms 0 hole for his 00th at 000 to tie the game at 0  then hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 000 the flyers set up in the sabres zone and stayed there off a faceoff high in the sabres zone in the middle while brindamour wrestled for the puck dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to haseks glove side at 000  play started to go back and forth until hawgood took a roughing penalty at 000 the flyers dumped the puck into the sabres zone brindamour and ledyard went after it and rod got the puck he backed away from the right boards skated to the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to dineen crashing through the slot all by himself dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of hasek for a 00 flyers lead at 000 0rd hat trick of the season for dineen 0th of his career 0nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 00th of the season  then carney took a tripping penalty at 000 to kill the rest of the sabres power play not much action on the 0 on 0 and the sabres got most of the chances on the flyers resulting power play  play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves the sabres werent able to pull hasek as time was running  out as the flyers wouldnt allow any consistant possession for the sabres finally as time was running out ken sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and brindamour stripped it away from him he pulled away and found dineen on the other side of the left circle and dineen found acton at the right of hasek he slid the puck between two sabres defenders and acton chipped it back to the far side of hasek for his 0th of the season at 0000 on his 00th birthday that was all the scoring shots were 0000 buffalo and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game  so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who hadnt been tested much in his last couple of starts kevin dineen has a career high 0 point night unless he had a better night earlier in the season but i dont think so the flyers longest winning streak in 0 years 00 goals for only 00 against with three shutouts eric lindros is 0th in league with 00 even strength goals despite missing 00 games with injury 0 points out of 0th clinched 0th place since the rangers lose the tie breaker  a couple misc notes  forget the mike keenan rumors there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the new york rangers next year  in the last notes i mentioned that garry galley won the barry ashbee award but i failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman  the times of trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from oklahoma has looked over tommy soderstroms medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future  same paper had a blurb about bill dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year his response was that he wants to come back he feels he did a good job this year but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if farwell didnt want him back  flyers team record watch  eric lindros  00 goals 00 assists 00 points  rookie records club record

  00peter aholaseason 0nd acquired0000 trade with pittsburgh for future considerations gradei b  it is way too early to tell about ahola who was acquired probably because the penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft  ahola had only played 00 games this season i think its actually less the san jose mercury news may be in err here 00 of them with the sharks  in the games he has played he appeared quite solid defensively although he hasnt been spectacular and his offense isnt anything to write home about 0 points its even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be  peter ahola  00doug wilsonseason 00th acquired0000 trade with chicago for rw kerry toporowski and 0nd round pick in 00 entry draft gradei b  i have often been accused of overly down on wilson i may have had too high expectations for him but his legs knees et al are giving out nevertheless when he was playing he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities even if he has lost a step on defense which unfortunately he demonstrated this year as well as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards and his offensive output was only good enough for 0nd place on the team 00 points in 00 games  but next year which may be wilsons last if he can stay healthy he can still be a contributor  00dean kolstadseason0nd acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradei cd  its probably somewhat unfair for me to judge kolstad on just a handful of games forgetting exact number but no more than 00 but at age 00 hes quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the nhl  in those games he did not impress anyone after generating 0 shots in the first period of the first game he played he scored just 0 points in his tenure up here with the sharks and was even less impressive defensively as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways  he needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team  00pat macleodseason 0nd acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradei   macleod was on the roster a lot longer than kolstad but it appears to my memory that he played less than kolstad because the sharks were reluctant to use him but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors figuring that he wouldnt clear waivers in fact he has played the past 00 weeks with kansas city but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment a rehab assignment that will include him playing in the turner cup playoffs since he has played so little i cant even give a tentative grade on him but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills  00tom pedersonseason 0st acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradei b  called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries pederson impressed many sharks fan here on net including yours truly  he demonstrated very good offensive skills scoring 00 points in 00 games  however his size 0 0 000 lbs is of concern and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically on both sides of the ice although he had appeared fearless in his approach but to be successful he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league  00claudio screminseason 0st acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradei dd  he played all of 0 games in the league this year but was thoroughly umimpressive just as he was at the end of last season again it may be a small sample but just as in the case of kolstad scremin at age 00 is quickly running out of time  he was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the sharks  the only notable thing that will go down in scremins entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now capitals goaltender don beaupre   go calgary flames  al macinnis for norris  gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in edmonton  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu recsporthockey contact for the san jose sharks

   and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded   resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other   team captain trivia would be appreciated    brad mccrimmon was the captain of the flames when he was traded to detroit  following the 000000 season this was during the offseason though    theres countless examples of captains being traded im sure  yeah i think that the flames and the flyers traded captains once mel   bridgeman for brad marsh  craig  
  nhmasgaussmedharvardedu mark shneyder 0000000 writes  the problem espn0 faces is the tcicablevision connection in the merger of their prime and sportschannel networks prime sportschannel will try to wrestle away nhl from espn in the offseason also tci and cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the country with a total of 00 million subscribers tcicablevision will do their best that espn0 never gets off the ground successfully and the nhls value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between prime sc and espn nhl is more vital to the survival of a regionalized prime sportschannel since they virtually have no national major league sports contracts and only cover local nhlnbamlb sports teams  note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various sc and prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local nhl owners whenif cablevision vp chuck dolans purchase of the islanders goes through the islanders will be back solidly in the scny fold their original owners were and theyve remained due to a lucrative tv contract  the flyer snyders own the philadelphia sc as well as the prism pay channel  there are six teams affiliated with regional scs another half dozen affiliated with prime outlets and other locals like hts and nesn who have barter arrangements  with all this crossownership i was surprised that espn got the deal this  season  gld   je me souviens  gary l dare  gldcolumbiaedu go  winnipeg jets  go  gldcunixcbitnetselanne  domi  stanley

  allancsualbertaca allan sullivan writes    i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton  oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference  next week while the exact details are not known it is believed  to concern the oilers future   rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement  with copps collesium in hamilton during the press conference  pocklington may announce the deal it is quite possible that  the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to  renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium   northlands has offered to buy the oilers for 00 million earlier  but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington   as for me my opinion is divided edmonton has been fairly  supportive of the oilers even though theyre a small market  team they had many sellouts in the 00s even with the problems  that the team had this year they still brought in more fans  than many teams in larger cities did on the other hand if  the team does move there is no place more deserving than  hamilton of course how would that affect the grand  realignment scheme of bettman     following up on this the provincial government has been asked by the opposition to block any deal that pocklington is offering to hamilton  the government said that pock is going nowhere    why dont i believe the government  wasnt it pocklington who wanted to be tory leader 0 years ago  dave shariff yadallee b sceconmath u of alberta 0000  yadalleeersysedmontonabca god save the queen god bless us allremember jesus saves lives from eternal damnation newfoundland keep good old clyde vote liberal

  i prefer to watch hockey than seeing shots of felix potvin slashing and spearing dino ciccerelli standing in front of the net  he has every right to stand in front of the net just not in the crease    yes he does  but the goalie sure as hell doesnt want him there  when  i played roller hockey boy do i miss those days as a goalie i would  scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot  i dont care if hes  in the crease or not get him the hell away from me so i can see the ball  yes roller hockey remember  and if there was nobody around to clear  the slot then id do it myself by pushing the offending playerhard   i hate people in my way when im the goalie and i am sure felix does  too  i should say that i didnt see the incident so if potvin really  swung the stick big time then thats not right but he can move people  out of the way  hes a player on the ice too you know            keith kellerlets go rangers  kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs       in this cornerlets go quakers       weighing in at almost every weight imaginable           life and all that surrounds it      blues traveler 0000 i have to agree wholeheartedly with this view  i dont like to see stickwork but you have to clear players away from in front  my personal favorite move im a goalie too is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref isnt looking  makes em go down like a ton of bricks but doesnt cause injuries unless they dont know how to fall im  talking about hitting the blades here not the foot  it also makes the  player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty  unfortunately it also leaves your blocker out of  position for a short timei dont do this if a shot is likely on the short side  hmmmaybe i should mail potvin this method in french and with helpful diagrams of course  it sure would be nice to see ciccerelli who i have a great deal of respect for btw hes not a big guy but he plays huge fall on his back a few times    barfly  
  theyre real and theyre spectacular the blues shutout the blackhawks in consecutive playoff games   if the blues sweep the hawks on sunday i will launch a broom onto the ice in the last seconds of the game not that theres anything wrong with that  curtis joseph has been the master of his own domain and the hawks have been shooting the puck like a bunch of chuckers not even superman could play any better in goal joseph must have been eating his cereal  its like a sauna in here said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and the wild crowd at the arena  it was very refreshing to see the blues doubledip the hawks  the hawks goons tried to pick on hull janney and joseph but the blues checking line nipped those hawks real well  the fat yoyoma will sing on sunday and the hawks will head to the beach the hawks trip back to chicago will feel like a long journey from milan to minsk  enjoy sundays game with some junior mints and wash them down with a snapple  just a little fun                                          a l l e z   l e s   b l u e s                                                                                                                                joe ashkar                                                              contact for the blues                            saint louis           jca0cec0wustledu                                        blues                                              
    roger neilson is not property  among other rumours hes now the 0 candidate to coach the flyers and will bring along colin campbell as his assistant   this would be dumb move of the ninetieslindros is big and strong but why give him a ball and chain on one leg and an anchor on the other to drag along   compuware is actively scouting phoenix for a new team in 0000 hey nick and jimmy  buy the devils and fix them here please  gld   not if pocklington gets there first actually if pocklington doesnt get a better deal he would probably go to hamiltontaking the team out of canada would get the whole country mad at him taking the team to hamilton wouldnt get anybody mad at him that  isnt mad at him alreadyand would make him a lot of friends in southern ontarioso many that the whining of the stupid politicians in edmonton and the fickle spoiled fans wouldnt be noticed at all edmonton would wallow in anonymnity  gerald  
  georgehgjhsun george h writes  lmarshacmsccwayneedu laurie marshall writes  don got his nickname grapes but im not sure  don use to coach the boston bruins  i dont know exactly when that was  could someone fill me in on this info  i think that the name grapes came because as coach for the bruins  or in the minors  he used to chew on grapes to keep from getting  dehydrated during the games  his dog blue may have been named  cause he liked labatts beer  anyone know about that   according to quotations from chairman cherry don was playing in springfield he and another player had to pay some fines the other player had his paid off but not don didnt want to  don called the other player a teachers pet and the other player replied ah thats just sour grapes  dont know how accurate that is but thats whats printed   
    the keenan hiring is precipitated by the loss of an anticipated 0m in playoff revenue and fears of losing season ticketholders  plus paramount chief stan jaffes chip against the flyers over laffaire lindros last autumn  add to this that neilsen might return as an assistant coach gerald whatd i say earlier today and roger conferred with jaffe on the hiring  this hiring by jaffe went over the head of msg inc par subsidiary head bob gutkowski and over the head and the protests of presgm neil smith   msg is making the announcement on saturday to get back at the islanders for making the playoffs ie steal the press   flyers owner ed snyder is livid and beside himself over this   keenan will make up to 000000yr   gary bettman has appointed an independent consul to look at gil steins admission into the hall of fame   new crease colours rather than blue   the oilers will charge to eat in the press room next year  gld   je me souviens  gary l dare  gldcolumbiaedu go  winnipeg jets  go  gldcunixcbitnetselanne  domi  stanley

  its about time the boys got it together they were outworked and outplayed by the wings in the first two games but burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear or is that high gear in game 0  except for a 0000 minute stretch in the 0nd period they outskated and outworked the wings  please dont flame this statement cos you know its true  i have to admit that  goaltending was the key  potvin kept the leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the leafs went through in the 0nd  he also kept the rebounds to a minimum something that cost cheveldae 0 goals  clark even looked like he had stopped moping first star although i still dont know why he was so flat in games 0 and 0  if the leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game 0 they may actually have a chance of winning this series a slim chance  but a chanceim no rmwhere is he anyways haha  barfly

  buffalo fans  some people in the discussion group as well as commentator al on espn  believe that game 0 is critical for the sabres  helloooo the sabres  are ahead 0 games to 0 not behind  as a lifelong sabres fan i am well  aware of their ability to choke but lets not exaggerate that  as long as  the sabres win one of the next 0 games be it game 0 or game 0 they are  still in good shape ahead 0 games to 0 with game 0 to be played at  buffalo  if they lose games three and four then start worrying  game 0 is  critical for boston not buffalo    rob andolina randolinpolisciumnedu     
  fuhr is proving the fuhrbashers wrong but boston is an awfully good team   yehbut   0biran sutters playoff record as the head coach in stl wasnt very impressive his blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs it doesnt look like this trend will change with the bruins  0 bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 00 in their entire 00year history it doesnt look like buffalo will just lose their next two games at the aud with the way fuhr has been standing on his head  basicallythe bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend alsoit seems like the whole boston area has gone baseball crazy after an incredibly great start by the red soxbest record in their major leagues as of now i would say that 00 of the callers to the bruins flagship stationsportsradio 000 are talking about the red soxabout 00 are yapping about the patriots upcoming draft00 are on the celtics and about 0 are on the bruins somehowno one around here is really schocked the way bruins are folding early  ppv mark

   the thing that confuses me most about espn is that they decided to show the   penguins and devils again on thursday night  being that both of the first   two games were dominated by pitt you would think that they would show a   different game  this is in addition to the fact that they should show other   games just for the sake of fair exposure  espn must have some very poor marketing people  they are only concerned with featuring players ie mario than featuring good competitive hockey   also some of you should know that as far as i can tell espn is not going   to show campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds  i   believe that they are only going to show campbell games in the first two   rounds as those series wear on games 0  0 or perhaps games 0 0 0   ive heard that this is because most of their market is east coast and hence would prefer the wales stuff  also dont expect canadian teams on espn  in summary if you want to see a network that provides good hockey coverage  watch cbc from canada  they may be biased toward canadian teams but they dont treat the viewers like idiots they provide nice updates and don cherry will always provide a few laughs    
  just heard on the news that mike keenan formerly of the blackhawks flyers and general of a siberian prison has just signed to coach the rangers  the rangers who won the presidents cup last year have slipped just a bit at the end of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly flyers the flyers fans are going to be disappointed on keenans decision because they were very interested in him  oh well  at least we got somebody the flyers wanted   is this really true  i have not been keeping up with any news  if it is whats the deal with neil smith  is he gone too       keith kellerlets go rangers lets go quakers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs              when i want your opinion ill give it to you   
  according to the hockey gurus over at espn should the islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record but the devils will be playing the penguins  this is because the islanders have won the season series against the devils  i think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include  0  season series 0  goals against 0  goals for  in this order correct me if im wrong  anyone have anything to add  i think that they go to divisional records before goals but i could be wrong too       keith kellerlets go rangers lets go quakers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs              when i want your opinion ill give it to you

  espn is pathetic i have been watching everybody complain about espns coverage and i agree with all of you  might i suggest that we are getting all worked up over nothing  we all knew that espns coverage was going to suck  i mean have you ever watched during the regular season sportscenter coverage of hockey it sucks i mean really sucks  espn does not know hockey if it shot them in the ass  i was really pissed of about last night coverage  i go to school in ohio i know the indians suck so why show them  if i were bill clement i would shoot myself  anyway after i calmed down after i realized that they were not going to show overtime of the caps isles game i thought to myself i knew that this was going to happen in fact i remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even the boring devils game  overall i think espn does not care if they show hockey or not and i firmly belive that they have know respect for the fans ie because of contract        obligations screw you espn  praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit  go hawks   this is the price hockey fans have to pay for the mistake of leaving espn 0 or 0 years agoit will take time to correct for that mistake  but returning to espn was the correct decision last yearby next time we may have the potential for sportschannel and espn to really compete to offer better coverage and be forced to deliver on it   gerald  
   here we are with the sabres up 00 to the bruins and the sabres farm team the rochester amerks on their way to the calder cup urp and what kind of hockey coverage are we getting the same penguinsdevils every other day crap that everyone else gets whats worse the sportschannel coverage of the islanders appears to be blocked out since we got cba basketball last night if you can believe it  i assume the sabres are demanding the sc blackout not espn since we are unbelievably usually considered part of the islanders territory msg coverage of the rangers is blacked out here this despite being a solid seven hours plus from long island  does anyone know what grc is doing besides putting their satellite dish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels 0 00 and 00 did empire demand a fortune for the games what about the games on fox00 or whatever number it is there in buffalo has anyone phoned to complain besides me  george    george ferguson                 arpa fergusoncsrochesteredu dept of computer science       uucp rutgersrochesterferguson university of rochester         vox  000 0000000 rochester  ny  000000000       fax  000 0000000  
    buffalo is up 00 is the series with boston and the reasongrant fuhr    fuhr is playoff hungry and hes proving once again why they call him   money goaltender fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the   league anymore statistically at least but hes proving that he can   make the big save at the right time   the leafs should have kept fuhr and probably would have had a chance    against powerhouse detroit but againwhere was andreychoke in game 0  i applauded the sabres for making the deal to get fuhr specifically because i thought it would help them win at least one playoff series  however i dont think the leafs can be faulted eitherthere is nothing to say that felix wont be winning playoff series by himself in years to come    anyway does anybody else find it ironic that fuhr is up against moog or at least he was until a guy named alex showed up

  yahooooooooo  the habs tied this sucker at 0 and the teams now head for quebec city to play game 0  btw final score was habs 0nords 0  the score might be a bit misleading  the habs dominated the game from the 000 mark of the first and then on  the score should have been 00 if it werent for some miraculous save from a ron hextall bastard  hes the reason the score was as close  habs winning goal was scored by benoit brunet at 000 of the 0rd  roy had an ok game  he made the first save one way or another and the defense was there to clear any rebounds  this just in espn radio reports that the bruins lost 00 in ot yahooooooooooo  those suckers got what they deserved  life is just great now if my finals would go just as well  nick ill take off my town crier hat now    the czar of mainframe computing  bgk0musicbmcgillca  mcgill university   
   i will also be happy will a good performance  we played ok in vancouver but much better last night as the big guys were going for the jets    yep though my reasons for being relatively quiet are simplelast year i woofed when we went up 00 on the canucksand look where it got me    by the way did domi play last night  i didnt notice him on the ice    domi got tossed in the 0nd with a highsticking major  he had been playing with kris king and stu barnesand it was this line that was arguably the best in the first two games   i am very glad to have found some places in champaign illinois that have satillite dishes to pick up the cbc vancouver feed and im also glad to have found some other hockey fans some jets and some canucks fans to watch the game with    definitely a good thingevery little cheer helps evan   good thing the net doesnt need a voice to operatei wont have one sunday night when i get home i hope  white noise here we come     one thing i will say thoughvancouver can keep steve armitage and john garrett as a broadcast teamthose two are bad especially when you are spoiled by don wittman  at least four or five times steve called barnes selanne  whoops   daryl turner  rsh contact for the winnipeg jets  internet umturne0ccuumanitobaca   fidonet 0000000 or 00000  please route through 000000 tkachuk over to zhamnov up to selnne he shoots he scores  the jets win the cup  the jets win the cup essensa for vezina  housley for norris  selnne for calder  
  its over  the sabres came back to beat the bruins in ot 00 tonight to sweep the series a beautiful goal by brad may lafontaine set him up while lying down on the ice ended it fuhr left the game game with an injured shoulder and lafontaine was banged up as well however the sabres will get a weeks rest so injuries should not be a problem  montreal edged quebec 00 to square their series which seems to be headed for game 0 the habs dominated the first two periods and were unlucky to only have a 00 tie after 00 minutes however an early goal by brunet in the 0rd won it  the islanders won their 0rd ot game of the series on a goal by ray ferraro 00 the caps simply collapsed after taking a 00 lead in the 0nd the isles alltime playoff ot record is now 000   vlad the impaler  
  like many others i too was watching the capsisles game when the went to the baseball game  i too was pissed  how could they interupt such an important game  i understand about contracts but you would think they would have a clause in the contract concerning important games anyway  us blues and hawks fans got shafted worse  while everyone in the us and watched the game on abc  however those of us who live in the central illinois area were subjected to watching the arthritus telethon  the area that was most affected by the telecast did not get to see the game except through hawk vision  this game had it been televised would have been the first home hawks game shown in the area since 0000  this television bull has got to stop  we are not only being deprived of seeing games due to skyrocketing ticket prices but we are also being deprived of watching them on tv  peace  hammer    
  being a a blues fan i dont get to see much else from around the league with the exception of hockey night on espn  i cant get the blues games where i go to school thus i dont get to see a whole lot of other teams play except for the hawks  but last night i got to catch a glimpse of the capsisles game  it occurred to me that turgeon is a stud on skates his moves are quick and brilliant  you ny fans should be proud ps who won the game capsisles   peace hammer    
  bufflo sabres has just finished their great four wins over boston all sabres players contribute to those great wins but those talent players including mogily fuhr kemhlev and lafontin impressed me most their  skills showed the art of sport not like the garbage speech from the coachs corner  go  make hocky popular make hocky more exciting but less violent

   capsisles fans  anyone interested in catching the games from nassau coliseum hopefully there will be another can catch the game at north carolinas original sports bar in chapel hill  im pretty sure they carry hts as well they had all three games on at the same time last night  this is the only place i know to catch all of the stanley cup action  frank salvatore fmsalvateosncsuedu  
    i am sure some bashers of pens fans are pretty confused about the lack of any kind of posts about the recent pens massacre of the devils actually i am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved however i am going to put an end to nonpittsburghers relief with a bit of praise for the pens man they are killing those devils worse than i thought jagr just showed you why he is much better than his regular season stats he is also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoffs bowman should let jagr have a lot of fun in the next couple of games since the pens are going to beat the pulp out of jersey anyway i was very disappointed not to see the islanders lose the final regular season game          pens rule

     by the way i am canadian play a little and watched  hockey night in canada never missed a show  well thats really great pat  i guess since youve played a little you thereby  qualify as an expert  especially since you watch all the games on tv  all  that qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato   not that i condone violence but ill make an exception for mario pat walker  again just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are  truly a  stupid statement  mario is definately one of the best players to play the game im not saying he is the best to ever play the game but he should come to mind when that question is asked  lets face it he just returns from  radiation therapy with around a dozen games left overtakes lafontaine for the scoring lead and then buries him  no i guess he just got lucky speaking of lafontaine now theres a guy who should be considered for the hart trophy as well certainly one of the better players in the league this year

  im a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best i can here in the hockey hinterlands oklahoma  im hoping i can get a reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas  ive been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly the hockey state in the us  so why is the team moving to a city in texas  is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or were the stars really not making a profit  or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging  as much as id like to see the nhl only a 0 hour drive from me i cant help but feel for the people in minnesota unless they truly didnt support the team    opinions please  steve hunter national weather service nexrad radar group norman ok

in a wc for the first time since 0000 and the swiss  now have a small chance of reaching the quarterfinals if austria beats  italy tonight   the swiss took the lead after hakan ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop  pass at his own blue line and celio came in alone with soderstrom and beat  tommy to the stick side the swedes continued to make mistakes as howald  was allowed to skate in between the swedish d and put the puck past tommy  to make it 00 00 was a nice one howald entered the swedish zone slammed  on the breaks and his shot went in by tommys far post one of the lousiest  periods ive seen sweden play this year  second period saw a new swedish team and the swiss had to ice the puck many  times on a pp nylander skated in from the boards pavoni made the initial  save but peter andersson scored on the rebound  then a power play goal  from the swiss a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way  to the goal and past soderstrom also jonas bergqvist made it 00 after a  nice pass from naslund behind the goal jan larsson reduced the lead to 00  just before the end of 0nd period on a pp skated in unattacked in front of  the goal and put the puck through pavonis 0hole   third period sweden equalized on a slap shot from renberg that trickled  through pavonis 0hole then another defensive mistake by the swedes  waeger was allowed to skate around the swedish goal unattacked and from close  range could make it 00 hollenstein then scored 00 on a 0on0 break away  and put it top shelf with no chance for soderstrom   switzerland   goaltender  00 reto

to win against the effective canadians   galley took a slap shot that found dineen by the far post and dineen just  deflected the puck past trefilov in the russian goal then a power play  goal after a couple of deflections eric lindros found kariya alone by the  far post and kariya put the puck high over a sliding trefilov  russia won the shots in the first period 000 and they had the most of  the scoring opportunities but they just couldnt score  second period saw lindros scoring his 00th  goal of the wc kariya  entered the russian zone slammed on the break to get past his defenseman  then made a nice pass to corson who just got the stick on the puck to  deflect it to lindros who onetimed the puck  the russians then finally got their goal karpov broke in from the side  and made a slap shot in tugnutts top right hand corner    player of the game in canada was voted paul kariya and for russia valeri  karpov i agree the difference in this game was lindros and kariya and  in part also tugnutt kariya had a far better game now than vs the swedes  and he was very impressive kariya got the place in the line with lindros  after mike gartner went out with a ribinjury early in the first period   lindros btw lead the point scoring with 00 pts 00 before this game  0 pts ahead of the next player ie double as much as the next player  among those kariya with 00 amazing     group b results

   vzhivovsuperiorcarletonca vladimir zhivov writes game 0 report deleted it bad refing wont affect this  series which should only go two more games all things being equal  wrong  the kings just put on an exibition of hustle team play and consistent  pounding and took it back to calgary with the series tied at 0 games each the final score was 00 with the third goal an emptynetter at 0000 of the third conacher  this is not an official game report just my observations from the stands  0 melrose made a wise decision and put stauber back in goal robb had    something to prove and he did in stopping 00 of 00 while facing a     fierce calgary attack there were numerous highlight film saves  0 kings third and fourth lines rose to the occasion playing rough while    avoiding bad penalties warren rychel scored the gamewinner early in the    second period rookie defenseman alexi zhitnik scored the first from the     blue line late in the first   0 dave taylor is awesome he suffered a broken nose partway through the    second pariod checked from behind into the boards by roberts who got    0 and a game he came back late in the third and was on the ice when    conacher scored the empty netter   actually it was in the third period his return did bring a spark to the crowd and to the players who played awesome defense in the third   0 the kings goto guys still are not producing no goals from kurri granato    sandstrom or robitaille who have a total of 00 points between them   you forgot about gretzky  if any of these guys start scoring the kings will be unstoppable if they continue the great defensive work as well   0 mccreary sucks he called mcsorely for high sticking someone who was already    on the ice and sandstrom for high sticking when he himself was already on    the ice he missed many flagrant stick penalties including one from flame    goalie jeff reese who followed granato out to almost the blue line where he    crosschecked him he called the game very inconsistently with a series of    tickytack penalties in the first and almost none in the third cant the    nhl supply decent officiating  0 i was sitting directly across the ice from ron and nancy reagan when the    empty netter was scored nancy leapt out of her seat with both fists high    in the air way to go nancy   this series is still too close to call tuesdays game may be the deciding one i expect king might put vernon back in even though reese had two good games in la reese has historically been good in la this was only the second time he lost there this move would be good for the kings since vernon is  such a sieve i am sure that stauber will get the call for the kings  stauber will be in net on tuesday  hopefully he will provide another stellar performance and earn the name robb stopper stauber   the firswt two lines of the kings have to wake up while it is great to see you cannot depend on pat conacher and warren rychel for all of your offense i expect sandstrom granato and gretzky might be put back together on a line like they were early in the season this would leave kurri carson and luc as the second on paper these two lines look powerful lets see if they can make it real  i believe this is how they arei know it is gretzky and sandstrom but he has been putting a number of people on left  also the carson robataille kurri line once ignited will light the fire of the other lines hopefully  go kings  dvb     it is evident that the scoring drought is getting to luc after his slight breakaway in the third i think he was steamed on the bench this emotion might help him break his streak  also i have noticed blake has had a few really good chances to score but has fanned or shot wide  is the injury still affecting him     the e     d     g     e  stompkintubacalpolyedu

  in 0000apr0000000000000solctrcolumbiaedu phoenixstartidectrcolumbiaedu ali lemer writes im not even going to bother to reply to your ranting post the letter is  addressed to gary bettman not you he can reply as he wishes  not so  your post is addressed to all  i quote  as she said the letter is addressed to bettman  the post which though having pretty much the same content is an entirely different entity was addressed to all  when she puts the letter in the mail i doubt it will say to all  i figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here  thats an entirely  different purpose than sending the letter to bettman  unfortunately  and i guess i let you know didnt i  you do not represent a large body of hockey fans by any standard you care to use to define large  00 people constitutes nothing more than a tiny  group of fanatics and is in no way representative of a large body of hockey fans on the internet let alone of one of the largest computer networks in  the world   the largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of  the internet not a group as a whole that she claims to represent  as for the business of whether or not it is large it is large compared to say the number of folks on rsh who are sending a letter to thank him for changing the names at least to this point  and just for my own curiosity i thought id look up the official definition of large in the dictionary  it reads  large  0  having more than usual power capacity or scope             0  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size  now i have no idea how many letters bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them  00 people may be up there  thereby validating definition 0  i would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large which would give it a large scope  he might be impressed by the size of the list of names  why would he be impressed with this unless it were large   i am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear yourself speak    i personally dont know whether or not i agree with the letter  i have very mixed emotions about it  i like the names as they are and dont think they make it that difficult to learn the game but there might be a shred of validity to the change      paul w francisco            in the shadow an angel cries catchernetcomcom                       front line assembly  
  again i assume this is not just flame bait by roger but actually a truly held opinion    i would say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that i belong to  and i dont share those views  and i dont believe that the majority of posters on rshockey share those views  and so i have no intention of allowing them to simply go ahead without making my feelings on the subject clear  thanks  for speaking for all those who didnt feel it was important enough to say something themselves    i wouldnt say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that you belong to  it represents a subset that you dont belong to of a larger group which you do if only because this isnt a moderated group  look there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint  three that come to mind are as follows  0 say it subtly  result it may not be clear 0 say it directly yet politely  result probably it will spark some     interesting conversation 0 say it directly and obnoxiously  result validity goes right out    the window  i would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature  you realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be used against you    paul w francisco            in the shadow an angel cries catchernetcomcom                       front line assembly  
   i havent seen any mention of ogrodnick yet in the box scores  does anyone know if hes playing  mike   hes been out but he isnt injured  he played well when he was put into the lineup at the end of the season  murray has to sit somebody out though  if the red wings hadnt played as well as they did in the first game he may have been in the second  why should murray juggle players when the wings are dominating toronto like they are  
   paulfugudataiocom paul brownlow writes   wood played most of his junior career in seattle  he was one of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in 0000  he rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in the whl    wood is fairly small for an enforcertype i mean fleury does a pretty good  job and isnt that large but dody is no fleury   and fleury is no enforcer an agitator for sure but fleury never has and never will have a fight which seems to be what youre saying wood is   the closest fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against los angeles there was a scrum and mcsorley pinched fleurys head under his arm fleury dropped his gloves and gave mcsorley a weak shot to the side of the head mcsorely knowing a good thing when he saw one popped fleury one right between the eyes end of fight fleury got ten stitches for his trouble  the only player i can ever see theo fighting is cliff ronning and even then hed be giving up two inches and 0000 pounds   alan

      i dont think the sharks should dig into the free agent market  most of  the good free agents will require quite a bit of compensation and set the  sharks back as far as player development goes remember the sharks were  unwilling to give up players in addition to the 0 million they offered for  joe murphy and i think thats a good approach  they tried to sign sergei  makarov before this season because makarov wouldnt have required compensation  matching the makarov offer was the only real mistake dave king has made this year i have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 00year old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a 0year 0 million contract  risebrough matched the offer on kings request and makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks not to mention that hes lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes   i think makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract hes ineffective in calgary but he might be able to help a team like san jose with their shortage of talent if theres no takers and makarov doesnt show improvement in training camp i think the flames will just bite the bullet and buy out makarovs contract and release him with his current attitude he is a detriment to the team  alan  
      when you think of the nhl who comes to mind gilmour gretzky mario   ah did i mention mario if you said gretzky you havent really  been following along have you if you said gilmour you are a true  maynard     i dont even think the selection of the hart deserves serious discussion on  this group it is a nobrainer  while i agree that lemieux deserves the hart it is far from a nobrainer  the hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team not to the best player in the league so your above arguement is really worthless   the pens without mario are still a damn good hockey team the leafs without  gilmour would have been fighting tampa bay for the 0rd pick   like i said mario deserves it imho but it is a very close race and a  gilmour victory would not surprise me i dislike doug gilmour with a passion  but i must concede that he is extremely valuable to the leafs  alan  
   i for one am happy about the rangers hiring of keenan  its too bad   that they  didnt hire him when smith fired nielsen maybe he could of staightened   out the  babies on this team and made the playoffs  what this team needs is a   little  fire under their butts    reading through most of these hockey news i dont see many ranger fans   writing     im new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering0000   ranger  fan  but remember suffering builds character    i have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that   last  dreadful stretch    0 knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didnt we   see mike  hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when leetch first   went  down    0 why is joe kocur playing every night  he is not bob probert   who is  tough but also can play    0 how come paul broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of   the  season  at least he plays with some heart and character draws   penalties and  plays 000 when hes on the ice  was he in the doghouse for some   reason    0 joe cirella  enough said    ranger fans may be suffering but were some of the most loyal unlike   islander  fans who only show up when the team wins    as far as the stanley cup goes i think theres only one team that can   test  pittsburgh and thats detroit  this would be the most entertaining and   hard  fought series  mario is amazing    kurt  i think joe kocus should play every night   he is a big physical guy and   he gets the fans into the game with some big hits  both checks and   fists  its a big advantage to get the crowd going  plus he helps   protect the other players  notice there are very few fights when kocur is   on the ice unless he is it  i have seen people start to go after essa   tikkanen only to go slinking away when kocur steps in  i think he is big   asset but should be third line and special situation only play          
  nluxenonstanfordedu nelson lu writes  acquiredc marcus thuresson from n y islanders forrw brian mullen gradei bc  it is not known yet what the impact overall of this trade would be as thuresson is not yet under contract to the sharks and does not appear to be ready to become so anytime soon  mullen meanwhile has had a productive somewhat season with the islanders  thuresson however does not appear to be a big scorer at all if my memory is right he had just 0 points in just 00 games in the swedish elite league in 0000  this season i didnt notice his name frequently at all in staffans reports and he didnt make the national team either it does not appear to be a good sign   marcus thuresson had 0 goals 00 assists 00 points and 00 pim in 00 games  this season for leksand in the swedish elite league this was only 00th  in point scoring for leksand   marcus born may 00 0000 ht 000 cm wt 00 kg is relatively young so he  might still start producing but i think the sharks may have done a bad  trade here   staffan       staffan axelsson      etxonssufsaericssonse  rsh contact for swedish hockey  
  like many others i too was watching the capsisles game when the went to the baseball game  i too was pissed  how could they interupt such an important game  i understand about contracts but you would think they would have a clause in the contract concerning important games anyway  us blues and hawks fans got shafted worse  while everyone in the us and watched the game on abc  however those of us who live in the central illinois area were subjected to watching the arthritus telethon  the area that was most affected by the telecast did not get to see the game except through hawk vision  this game had it been televised would have been the first home hawks game shown in the area since 0000  this television bull has got to stop  we are not only being deprived of seeing games due to skyrocketing ticket prices but we are also being deprived of watching them on tv  peace  hammer    im familiar with the telethon situation an individual on compuserve was also victimized and was equally pissed  that was a local television station contract which could not be broken  for that item i strongly suggest you call that affiliate and vent your anger on them  supposedly one station had told my friend that they have received hundreds of angry calls which will translate into far less incentive to preempt hockey telecasts in future  the contract was written when the pathetic wlaf was in that time slot  tom galvin         galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil   
   okay heres some gripeing griping whatever  i live in santa barbara for reference i think  okay abc showed the kingsflames fine yawn  espn through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the   red wingstoronto game cool  but i swear that the advertisements all week long had said that   espn would show pittnj on tuesday and bosbuff on thursday  i raced home from work early 000 pacific to catch the game but   alas it was the bostonbuffalo game and then they promised that they would   show the pittnj game on thursday  overnight they changed their mind  rest deleted      espn never committed and i never saw advertised to a particular thursday game  they had originally scheduled bosbuf and that was somehow leaked on this net but to my knowledge espn never publicly released a schedule until monday when they announced pittnj thursday and bostonbuffalo saturday  tom galvin         galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil     
  the thing that confuses me most about espn is that they decided to show the  penguins and devils again on thursday night  being that both of the first  two games were dominated by pitt you would think that they would show a  different game  this is in addition to the fact that they should show other  games just for the sake of fair exposure  nesn owns the rights to bruin telecasts  i suspect that nesn was only going to sell one telecast to espn remember espn only owns exclusive rights to the finals not the entire playoffs  since espn bought the sca contract there are less wrangles to untie with showing the devils and penguins   also some of you should know that as far as i can tell espn is not going  to show campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds  i  believe that they are only going to show campbell games in the first two  rounds as those series wear on games 0  0 or perhaps games 0 0 0    i think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it  plus they have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule unless the nhl was willing to make a western club move up their game i think the nhl got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for abc  also does anyone have info on abc coverage for this sunday 000    same exact coverage as last week  pitnj game 0 in the east chistl in the central lacgy in the mountains and west   robert andolina randolinpolisciumnedu   tom galvin      galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil

     bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 00 in   their entire 00year history     which doesnt mean much since the statistics are mostly based on the 0game playoff format but yes it looks dark for the bs what a disappointment     still i think the problem is mental they needed the saves blue came up with perhaps he can offer something to mentally rally around     who do you think gets the start in game three i hope it is going to be blue if the team can rally around him maybe moog can too    jan brittenson    bsongnuaimitedu

  snicholsadobecom sherri nichols writes  of course ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal contributions before he was fired so its not clear that this would have been different  besides they were marginal contributors  lets also not forget that ferreira came this close to trading kelly kisio which if the rumors ive heard are true was over the strong objections of other aspects of shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the threeheaded consensus oriented gm  imagine for a second where the sharks would be today if that fax machine hadnt jammed  on the other hand im hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes fereirra made  imagine indeed but then again we have the benefit of hindsight  lets say that in the view of the sharks upper management the attempt to trade kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire feirerra im inclined to take exactly the opposite view  they should have kept himhes obviously the luckiest man in hockey  wonder what sacrifice he made to the muse of fax  his job i guess  have fun gak   richard stueven       aha 00000  he has erected a multitude of new internet            gakwrscom go offices and sent hither swarms attmail attmailgakhausgak sharx of officers to harass our people cow palace            000h00  and eat out their substance

   terence rokop writes  richard j coyle writes   thats not inner calm  its boredom and its being spoiled  the arenas been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just take winning for granted  its been seemingly forever since the team lost and weve forgotten what its like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory  i dont really agree with this  but it is an entirely different high at any rate  the first cup the pens won i didnt think about anything else i just watched mario and all skate the thing around the ice  now it seems to be more of a question whether or not thirty years from now young hockey fans may there be millions will still ask us what it was like to watch this team  thats what they are playing for now  but i was still as nervous as ever when the devils were blasting shots at barrasso in the final seconds of game three so the fun is far from over yet  im not bored either  most people i know say that winning the second cup was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one but im every bit as excited this year and i am experiencing that inner calm to which susan originally referred  inner calm is not boredom  as far as the arena in general being boring well richards got that right its been that way all season  i attribute it to a lot of new fans who just dont have the same spirit and knowledge as longtime fans  at last tuesdays game i overheard a man express surprise that a goaltender can get an assist  anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen at any time  im confident in the pens but im also not stupid enough to think for one minute that its impossible for new jersey to blow them out of this series  i doubt that will happen but its possible  bored  uhuh spoiled  not in the least  forgot what excitement is like  living through that amazing streak wasnt exciting  i dont take a darned thing for granted  god look at chicago  and i see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway  it isnt gonna last forever and i intend to enjoy it while i can    mom

  cs000000arielyorkuca shawn luddington writes  as for the picks ottawa picks 0 which means it is almost 000 that alexander daigle will  go 0 hell either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec  i dunno about hat i have friends up there on genie who are now saying that ottawas gone soft on daigle and is thinking hard about pronger daigle has shown an attitude the latter part of this season many folks havnet liked and after coming back from his second multigame suspension for being stupid hes really tanked in his performance his stock is dropping like a rock   also remember that a lot of teh draft 0st stuff comes from the assumption hell be traded to quebec for lots of prospects its not clear that  quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current status hes still first round but i dont consider him a first pick lock by any means at this point  its also possible that the senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price since daigle has been taking some lindros lessons during thos suspensions  imo i would take kariya  he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in the world championships  daigle didnt show this for his junior team  san jose will then get kariya  no kariya wont go in the first three for a very simple reason hes not leaving college and i dont believe any of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who wont be around for another year or two not when there is equally good or almost as good stuff available that can make an immediate impact san jose seems to be leaning heavily towards niedermayer for that reason kariya could go 0th or 0th unless a team can convince him to leave school early which i doubt   my cut on things as they stand today  draft order  0 ottawa 00 daigle if not 00 pronger 0 san jose 00 niedermayer unless ottawa skips daigle then its open it depends on if the sharks can get a deal for him i dont believe they draft him to keep him 0 tampa bay whoever ottawa doesnt take or maybe koslov     chuq imho von rospach esd support  training dalaux  chuqapplecom    member sfwa  editor otherrealms   genie macbigot  alinkchuq    minor league fans minorsrequestmedrautapplecom san jose giants a00   san francisco giants fans giantsrequestmedrautapplecom the sticknot    san jose sharks fans sharksrequestmedrautapplecom new seat 000tbd

  joe00pittedu joseph b stiehm writes    come on boston where the hell are you seven wins in a row and what choke  ah well another brian sutter team is ground into the dirt with intensity during the regular season and then is burned out by playoff time yah fuhr has been awesome so far but really youd think sutter would have learned his lesson about pushing his team too far during the regular season  stuart esrock   bowling green state u   how bout them blues  
  is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad  i cant remember how many times during the penguinsdevils game they showed some guy without the puck being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal  in fact i think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner  now the last time i watched a football game they didnt show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown       is it just me  greg   espn has been trying various things to get away from the followthepuck concept of televising hockey games  one of the main problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything that is going on  more happens away from the puck than in any other sport except maybe football and they can do isos on football players to be shown between plays  the problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile other times you get burned  tom galvin        galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil   
  cr000clevelandfreenetedu jim schenk writes    one last point darryl sutter is getting badly out coached by bob berry  the  madder darryl gets the more he reminds me of brian  the hawks are  quickly loosing thier focus i dont think the blues will win in 0 but you  never know  not to sutter bash or anything since i idolized them as players you sure would think the sutters would learn something about burning out their teams in the regular seasonjust too much intensity during the regular  season  i earlier posted a note about brian and got to thinking after i read this itemgee both sutters won their divisions and now both have lost  home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the playoffs  kind of makes you wonder  bottom lineman it is great to be smoking the warthawks agreed jimthis has been damn sweet so far  about the only thing that comes close to this is shutting up all the maple laugh fansdetroit has completely kicked their asses so far  but i will stick with the blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far  stuart esrock  bowling green state u  go you blues  
  with the recent demise of the chicago blawkhawks much to my delight i noticed their 0  game playoff losing streak 0 to the pens last year and now 0 to the blues and i am wondering what the nhl record for consecutive losses is if there even is one  im pretty sure that the hawks have at least a 0 game losing  streak since theyve had to have lost a series since their last championship whenever that was  basically i need something else to rag on my hawksfan friend with   mike the insomniaced  yesrushmarillionemerson lake and palmergenesisdream theater  mike weintraub aka jvi on irc   sig quote du jour   mweintramericanedu            life is like a scissorspaper     jediwavecerfnet               stone game none of the answers    the american university          is always right but sometimes     washington dc                  each one isneil peart rush go philadelphia phillies and vancouver canucks 0 down 00 to go

    have belfour and roenick done another disappearing act at chips are   down time  when i saw them it looked like the blackhawks defense  might carry them along way in the playoffs     well they held st louis to 00 shots in game 0 and lost   looks like maybe keenan had has some insight to me  
    in article 0000apr000000000eaglewesleyanedu  writes  i for one am happy about the rangers hiring of keenan  its too bad    that they  didnt hire him when smith fired nielsen maybe he could of staightened    out the  babies on this team and made the playoffs  what this team needs is a    little  fire under their butts    reading through most of these hockey news i dont see many ranger fans    writing     im new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering0000    ranger  fan  but remember suffering builds character    i have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that    last  dreadful stretch    0 knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didnt we    see mike  hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when leetch first    went  down    0 why is joe kocur playing every night  he is not bob probert    who is  tough but also can play    0 how come paul broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of    the  season  at least he plays with some heart and character draws    penalties and  plays 000 when hes on the ice  was he in the doghouse for some    reason    0 joe cirella  enough said    ranger fans may be suffering but were some of the most loyal unlike    islander  fans who only show up when the team wins    as far as the stanley cup goes i think theres only one team that can    test  pittsburgh and thats detroit  this would be the most entertaining and    hard  fought series  mario is amazing    kurt    i think joe kocus should play every night   he is a big physical guy and    he gets the fans into the game with some big hits  both checks and    fists  its a big advantage to get the crowd going  plus he helps    protect the other players  notice there are very few fights when kocur is    on the ice unless he is it  i have seen people start to go after essa    tikkanen only to go slinking away when kocur steps in  i think he is big    asset but should be third line and special situation only play       this is fast becoming a game without the goons  i admit kocur may get the fans into the game but surely they would rather see broten taking a pass from kovalev and scoring a breakaway goal to put the rangers up 0 magic  goals in the third period rather than seeing kocur take another stupid penalty and the rangers giving up another powerplay goal   the rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure off messier and the first line  nemchinov is a perfect third line center  so who goes beezer or richter  kurt    
  does anyone know if msg will televise any of the binghampton rangers playoff games  even taped replays would be nice     
   rumor has it here in pittsburgh that there is going to be a penguins  broadcasting change before next season  according to the rumor the kbl  leadership the company the broadcasts the pens games wants to limit  loved broadcaster mike lange to radio only and hire don cherry as his  broadcast partner  this would mean paul stiegerwald would be fired  good riddance       does anyone know anything about this  lange is a fun broadcaster to  listen to and pens games wouldnt be the same without him  also i hear  cherry doesnt have high opinions of lemieux ulf sammuelsson or  jaromir jagr  how is he supposed to broadcast their games        i believe that the large number of digits on his paycheck and it would not be binary would help don to be a fan of ulf jaro and mario    nate peters  lifetime penguins fan even from before they were the best  kevin l stamber purdue university top 00 reasons the pittsburgh penguins won the patrick division 0 a strong desire to get the cup back to your neighborhood    eat n park  where theres always something special cooking   
  im personally expecting moog  blue played fairly decent alright spectacular at times in his 00 a game but moog has the experience what did blue have going for him nothing what would happen in a tie game the prssure is then on the goal tender to insure that you keep the puck out at the very least until your team scores  blue didnt face that kind of pressure on tuesday  the bruins will come out storming that is for sure  i really think that this series is up to buffalo boston except for two bad passes in game one really hasnt played that bad   as a believer is statistics you know that your going to get the puck by fuhr sooner or later just keep shooting  there game plan is sound but they need to take the lead first and control the tempo                 imho                       pat ellis  ps  go bruins    go umaine black bears    0000       number 0                     hockey east regulars season champions                    hockey east tournament champions                    paul kariya hobey baker award winner          ncaa div 0 hockey tournament champions                       maine      ggggooooooo    bbbllluueeee

  once again the leafs overcame the red wings in what was possibly the most exciting game played yet in this playoff year  potvin was solid and wendel completely dominated probert  gilmour as usual was the best player on the ice  and to those who claim that andreychuk fades in the playoffs please take note  andreychuk is averaging a goal a game    0 stars   andreychuk  0 goals wendel      all over probert probert     all over everyone else   todd gill also played an excellent game   we cant say enough about doug gilmour  when he is right all is well gilmour brings to mind davey keon from the previous leaf dynasty   predictions so far on track   nyi over buffalo and leafs over la kings   leafs over nyi in the final  i cant let this pass if the islanders get past pitts assuming the isles beat the caps god  willing them im sorry the isles will crush the leafs flame shields up   of course no one asked me i always interject my opinions on matters i have no  concern over   go islanders 0 down 0 to go go jets for 00            cordially as always                      maynardramseycslaurentianca                                             so many morons rm                                                 and so little time

  from matthew rush but hes starting to push it over the edge imho  of course holiks chop to barrassos neck wasnt too sportsmanlike either it seems that he was following the the only way to beat the penguins is to injure them philosophy  its pretty obvious that holiks hitting barrasso was an accident he was even apologizing for it immediately before the penguins all jumped on him  ralph

  in article randolin0000000000polisciumnedu randolinpolisciumnedu robert andolina writes many people have suggested that fuhrs play is the only reason that the  sabres beat the bruins  while fuhr was a critical factor i would not  overlook the fact that the sabres finally got some scoring from people other  than mogilny and lafontaine khmylev sweeney hawerchuck etc  indeed  lafontaine played hurt and didnt score many goals  also the team played  better defense although not great than in the regular season  fuhr  deserves a lot of credit but not all of it  robert a  i agree with this i also think fuhrs contribution for sabress win is just the same as many palyers in the team mogilny had six goals in four games including two goals for the great comeback in the final win after fuhr had left the key for sabress win over boston is whole teams strong commitment as an underdog and all their talent players including mogilny and fuhr   i think that grant fuhr deserves more credit than that while its true that the entire sabres team played very well i still believe that if it wasnt for grant fuhr the series would now be tied 00 he virtually stole games 0 and 0 for the sabres in both of these games fuhr stood on his head to give the sabres the chance to win especially in game 0 fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 00  even in game 0 when the sabres won 00 the score seemed to indicate that the sabres dominated however if it hadnt been for fuhr the sabres wouldnt have been up 00 i think it was through the 0nd period and the bruins wouldnt have had to open up the game thereby allowing mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game  there is no doubt in my mind that fuhr was the critical factor in the victory   in my opinion neely oates and juneau played as well as lafontaine mogilny and hawerchuk the sabres did get extraordinary efforts from hannan sweeney wood and khmylev compared to that of the bruins checkers however the bruins defense  imo played better than the sabres defense the sabres have ken sutton playing a regular shift afterall  the difference in the series was fuhr who outplayed andy moog   gary  go sabres  
  im a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best i can here in the hockey hinterlands oklahoma  im hoping i can get a reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas  ive been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly the hockey state in the us  so why is the team moving to a city in texas  is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or were the stars really not making a profit  or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging  opinions please   well as a hockey fan i think its terrible its one thing to say hey  lets give a hockey team to cities that dont have one  thats fine its entirely another to say okay lets take a team from a thriving hockey town and move it   of course none of us will ever know the real inside story but from what i know a group of minneapolis businessmen told green repeatedly that they would purchase the remaining 0000  season tickets to get to the 00000 level that green wanted yet he refused every time its pretty obvious that he was determined to get out of minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets thing as an excuse   i was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game and the fans were great people were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the parking lot before the game the attendance was so full as to have sro and the whole atmosphere in the centre was terrific minnesota is hockey usa how the nhl can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond  me i only hope they get a new team soon  just my 000    ali    ali procrastination lemer  i gave nhl commissioner gary bettman a puck columbia university nyc    once he spent the rest of the day trying to  phoenixctrcolumbiaedu     open it  pat williams gm orlando magic  be kind to animalshug a hockey player

  ive been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly the hockey state in the us  so why is the team moving to a city in texas  is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or were the stars really not making a profit  or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging   norman green claims that he has lost money over the last three years that he has owned the team  when he bought the team it seemed kind of obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red before the team started making a profit again  he gave the impression that he was willing to do so  he claimed two years ago that the team needed to average only 0000 fans per game in order to pull a profit but this season the team averaged 00000 fans despite increasd ticket prices  i think the teams attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move  he was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded such as guaranteed season ticket sales cheap rent at the other two arenas in town etc  oh well i guess the bottom line is   green wanted immediate huge returns in dallas and wasnt willing to wait another year or so in mn  dallas gave green a pretty stellar deal to play there although i feel minnesotas was quite reasonable and he also has some cronies down there as well  all this means is that minnesota is without an nhl team for a year or two  too bad for the nhl  kea

  okay the caps again are about to break out the golf clubs but before they do does anyone have the history of the washington capitals futility record in the playoffs i remember that terrys first year was the first year that the caps finally made it to the third round but before under brian i noticed that every other year the caps got to the second round and the years in between they didnt make it past the first round is this trend continuning  the admiral a hopeless caps fan ps we still remember that 0 ot loss to the islanders aurggghhhhhhhhh  admiral steve c liu          internet address admiraljhunixhcfjhuedu 0000 world champions   baltimore orioles  why not  series in the yards          00000000 stanley cup champions   washington capitals            the bangles are the greatest female rock band that ever existed    this sig has been brought to you by frungy the sport of kings      my god man drilling holes through his head is not the answer dr mccoy

  in article 0000apr0000000000000mkscom chuckmkscom chuck lownie writes potvin by the way has played very well  he kept toronto in the game last night during those 0 penalties in the first period by making great saves but they did end up getting to him in the second  the guy has a gaa of 000 in the playoffs and hes played very well hahahahahaa what a joke   did you watch the games          
  in article 0000apr0000000000000mkscom chuckmkscom chuck lownie writes in last nights game toronto received five penalties detroit none  if      which game were you watching  didnt you see the third period when the wings had 0 penalties called on them and then a delayed penalty the leafs had a 0 man advantage for about a minute and a 0 man advantage for another minute or two and the leafs still couldnt score   and i wonder how the leafs scored a powerplay goal if according to you they never had a powerplay   in the detroit paper today it said there were 00 penalties called in last nights game and youre saying detroit had none of those penalties im guessing you only watched the first period i have to admitt the leafs did get alot of penalties in that period where as the wings didnt get many if any at all havent looked at the box scores yet  but the ref more than made up for it in the third period   laurie marshall wayne state university detroit michigan go wings  my apologies for the typo  i meant the wings had 0 power plays in the first period and the leafs none    as well my point isnt that the refs were biased just that they were calling a lot of penalties which works to the benefit of the wings  having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then calling a bunch against the other to make up for it takes a lot away from what could have been a great game           
  what did happen to the swiss team  last year they reached the semifinal and now after 0 matches no points and even no goals  after the 00 against italy it seems they lost any hope and were overrun 00 by the russian team now it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the blevel does anybody know if this wc is the qualification tournement for the olympic games 00 in lillehammer or are some teams already qualified for them  hopp schwiiz            daniel  
  hooray i hear on tsn that the jets have won a game selanne getting a hattrick  of course here in gods country read ontario i couldnt see that game nor any other in the vanwpg series so far because our beloved cbc figures no one out here cares about this series which has looked pretty competitve so far  on monday and wednesday nights cbc could have shown the toronto detroit game done the news then picked up winnipegvancouver they didnt  tonight  you guessed it torontodetroit the news not the end of the jets game then calgaryla  so if its hockey night in canada why cant this ontarian see one of the two series with two canadian teams  is this too much to ask  paul badertscher 000000000uwovaxuwoca   id like to echo these sentiments  this is the worst coverage i can   ever remember seeing on cbc  as soon as the game ends i can count to 00  and by that time theyve signed off the air  no post game interviews  no updating of late scores nothin  tsn is really putting cbc to   shame  i only hope the later round coverage improves i mean who  really wants to see cbc primetime news instead of hockey   my 00   darren     darren reiniger                   reinigerugcsdalca  arishemacdalca  centre for marine geology dalhousie university halifax ns canada  people who wonder where this generation is going should remind themselves     where it came from in the first place                                        
   roger maynard wrote    once again the leafs overcame the red wings in what was possibly the  most exciting game played yet in this playoff year  perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that you have seen  for most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity  it was nowhere near the most exciting game  paul stewart called the single worst game ive seen this year   federovs major was obvious and i dont dispute it  however chaissons  penalty shouldnt even have been a penalty let alone a major and a game misconduct  the 0minute game misc call is for high sticking only  there is no blood penalty  just because  chaisson barely touched the  poor sap and he hit the dasher and bled profusely doesnt mean it is a  penalty   unfortunately the instant replay is not used on hits  at first i immediately thought 0 and a game because the hit looked much more severe from an intenttoinjure perspective than it was  after seeing the replay id say it deserved 00 minutes for boarding it was careless any way you  slice it  if stewart had replay i do not think chaisson would have gotten 0 and the game  in the second period behind potvin probert had the puck and was going to get out front and was tackled  i couldnt believe the nocall  this nocall was bullshit i agree i admire stewart for letting them go but probert looked up saying where the hell is the penalty  ive never seen probert whine either he doesnt need to  now if probie decides to put wendel through the boards hes probably gone right  i dont remember who on the leafs touched the puck  on racines shot towards the end of the game 000 seconds left but stewart called it out of play last touched by detroit  everybody in the garden including the linesmen knew it  yzerman protested but stewart just  laughed and really homered the wings  this was also bullshit  but once again no replay  it was rouse btw im really pissed that the linesmen didnt correct the call eitherits bs when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake    but when it all comes down to it wings played like shit  yes  the calls you describe should not have the difference in a detroit loss  i picked the leafs to win game 0 on emotion and adrenalin but the wings have no excuses for game 0  they should be the superior team  the call that pissed me off the most was anderson getting 0 for putting his stick in somebodys eye  that was the most dangerous stick infraction i have seen in a long time and everybody in the damn league knows hes an asshole when it comes to stickwork  four lousy minutes  bullshit call  murray should send the tape in  or a wing should hammer the living shit out of him   dchhabrastplistsca

  how did the leafs turn it around    i couldnt get the leaf games on the weekend in ca  did the leaf defense wise up overnight did the leafs get in the slot or  was it just fluke goals in a goalie duel  did the wings turn off the jets or muscle   what gives here  i caught game 0 on satellite  i figured my leafs were washed this is a major turnaround   very few predicted this  how how how did it happen     wing and leaf perspectives welcomed   jake    
  in berger000000000chaoscsbrandeisedu bergerchaoscsbrandeisedu writes   ive heard rumors recently from reliable sources that abe polin the  moron who owns the washington capitals is looking to move the team  after this season or next  milwaukee was mentioned as the teams  potential destination  the person who told me this is strongly  affiliated with the nhl and has been extremely accurate in the past  with news of this sort  does anyone know if this is so or has  heard anything of the sort  with baltimores ahl team gone that would  leave the area with only an echl franchise in baltimore not good  thanks       david  why dcbaltimore is one of the top media markets the only thing the nhl seems to care about these days theyve been doing far better than the nba bullets at the gate for the last five years the team has been a perennial contender and fan support has been good to excellent    why should pollin move to city thats five times smaller but has as many teams in other pro sports i dont get it           david  marcu

  finns had to do their best last night when they played against norway in world champs after two periods the score was still 00 this game was  quite much similar to the first game finland played  against france the norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky too in the third period juha riihijrvi scored 00 from a rebound the time was around 0 mins or so the second goal was scored by kari harila who shot straight from a faceoff behind the nowwegian goalie saku koivu the 00yearold center got his first point of this tournament saku koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game prize despite the fact that he is quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater  i think that we will hear from this guy in the future   
  in catcherc000j000fnetcomcom catchernetcomcom paul w francisco writes  as she said the letter is addressed to bettman  the post which though having pretty much the same content is an entirely different entity was addressed to all  when she puts the letter in the mail i doubt it will say to all  i figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here  thats an entirely  different purpose than sending the letter to bettman  and it is a damn good thing that she did post it since she claims to represent people in recsporthockey  unfortunately  the largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of  the internet not a group as a whole that she claims to represent  as  her sole purpose in mentioning the net as steve gallichio has already  pointed out is to lend weight to her points through association with the internet  there is no other reason to mention the internet  this is  misrepresentation and if the internet was a private corporation alison would be leaving herself wide open to all kinds of civil suits  for the business of whether or not it is large it is large compared to say the number of folks on rsh who are sending a letter to thank him for changing the names at least to this point  and just for my  this is not a letter  it is a petition claiming to represent a large proportion of recsporthockey users and by implication a significant number of internet users  00 names can in no way be considered a  large proportion of recsporthockey which while we have no way of counting actual readership is accessible to hundreds of thousands of people  00 persons is no more than a flys fart in a windstorm   own curiosity i thought id look up the official definition of large in the dictionary  it reads  large  0  having more than usual power capacity or scope             0  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size  gee  you looked up large in the dictionary  what next  two syllable  words  now i have no idea how many letters bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them  00 people may be up there  thereby validating definition 0  i would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large which would give it a large scope  let me suggest that the only place you are likely to envy the magnitude of  00 is when you are looking for ways to beef up your iq scores  he might be impressed by the size of the list of names  why would he be impressed with this unless it were large   as i said he might be impressed by the size of the list of names  but  it would have to be considerably larger  but even this definition does not account for the original context from which you lifted this sentence  i personally dont know whether or not i agree with the letter  i have very mixed emotions about it  i like the names as they are and dont think they make it that difficult to learn the game but there might be a shred of validity to the change    well then what the hell is your point  you dont really know if you have an opinion about the hockey issue but you do know that you dont like me   is that it      cordially as always                      maynardramseycslaurentianca                                             so many morons rm                                                 and so little time   
   susan dart writes  amongst penguins fans there seems to be an inner calm that ive never experienced before this year with the pens the players and the fans have so much confidence in the team this year were savoring every game and saving our energy for the stanley cup  thats a good way to put it  its a quiet confidence  i dont feel like i have to defend this team anymore   the devils are a puzzle to me  they have long been one of the few teams i always dreaded playing  their d isnt quite what it used to be but they still usually play us pretty tough  i just cant figure it out  at least last night they mounted an attack  0 watching some of the devils players being interviewed i could    see in their faces and eyes that they really dont have any    confidence they are left speechless when asked what more they    can to do to beat the pens they act as though they know its    a hopeless task  bernie nichols was interviewed after game 0 on the late news  he was shaking his head in disbelief over barrasso saying that tommy is like another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him then he got this faraway look on his face his voice started trailing off and he said it just isnt rightit just isnt fair and he tried to muster a smile  im really impressed with bowmans coaching tactics  hes had an answer for every move that brooks has thrown at the pens  as far as coaching goes a pensislanders matchup should be pretty good  one guy i feel sorry for in all of this so far is chris terreri  im sure tom barrasso knows how he feels  for so long tommy would look up and not have a teammate in sight  terreris teammates really left him out in the cold in the first two games  mom   
  news  for the first time all season the flames are now injuryfree the only player remaining on the limp is center carey wilson who even when healthy is not  a major part of the team   trent yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season game against san jose he potted his first of the year in that game and has also scored goals in both game 0 and game 0 against los angeles   thoughts on game 0   the flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with los angeles 00 on sunday afternoon they seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals they physically dominated the kings but that was the only area they dominated in the game plan was to rush the net and  try and take advantage of a young inexperienced la defence and the shaky kings goaltending but those plans fell by the wayside while the flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box particularily stupid was theoren fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming warren rychels face into the dasher while rychel was on his knees   goaltender mike vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the loss despite his wellpublicized poor record in afternoon games he got very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and  sweeping away rebounds in fact marty mcsorleys goal actually went in off chris dahlquists skate in front of the net   thoughts on game 0   the flames came back strong in the second game evidently aware of the potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice the first period was fairly even with the edge going to the kings but calgary came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the kings scoring five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 00 win   the deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams calgary dominated on faceoffs as they did in game 0 but they were able to make better use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one calgary also went 0for0 on the powerplay while la only went 0for0 and gave up a shorthanded goal to joel otto las powerplay goal also came late in the game with the outcome already decided the kings powerplay failed them when they needed it most in the 0st and 0nd periods   the flames lost rw greg paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he was leveled by alexei zhitnik right after scoring calgarys 0th goal charlie huddy left the game for the kings with a groin injury   the game was marred by stupidity in the last minute first craig berube of calgary took a fiveminute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for instigating when he went after tony granato for no apparent reason granato drew a minor for some strange reason turtling perhaps this was followed 00 seconds later by warren rychel drawing a major minor and game misconduct for hitting frank musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a fight musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason hardy and yawney went toetotoe and both got double minors gregson thought that musil  turtling amounted to fighting but that yawney and hardy throwing punches at  each other was just roughing wheres this guy from   upcoming games  friday april 00 at la sunday april 00 at la tuesday april 00 home to la  thursday april 00 at la if necessary

  in 0000apr0000000000000alchemychemutorontoca golchowyalchemychemutorontoca gerald olchowy writes  so whats stopping pocklington from going to a bank and borrowing 00 million dollars to pay off his treasury branch loansi was reading  according to the recent tsn report peter puck is not paying any interest on the treasury branch loans  thats a lot of green  somewhere than pocklington business have gross revenues of about 000 million per yeari dont think he would have much problem borrowing from his visa to pay off his mastercard if he wanted to  again according to tsn virtually everything that peter puck has already  has liens against it  of course we cant really be sure of this   pocklington is at the point of maximum advantage right nowand he is basically right in that northlands which is a creature of the city of edmonton must give him a better deal in the era of escalating salaries  northlands and the city benefitted as much as he did during the eighties from the oilersand wealth generated by the oilers success was sharedbut the finanical viability of small market teams has radically changed in the space of a couple of years and for the oilers to remain viable and competitive they need much more of the revenue stream from concessions parking and building advertising as most every other professional sports franchise in north america has  what was once a fair agreement that shared the wealth is now northlands sucking the blood out of the oilers franchise  the oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is that a deal is a deal  sather has spouted this repeatedly  pocklinton has a contract with northlands until 0000  a deal is a deal  perhaps if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets players such as gretzky and the income he has received in expansion fees with his revenues he wouldnt be losing money  he has admitted pulling this money out of the oiler franchise to put into his other businesses   the oilers have paid several times over what the coliseum cost to build and bring edmonton prestige and recognition throughout the world that is essentially pricelessto nickelanddime the oilers just so northlands can use revenue sucked out of the oilers to  subsidize their horseracing operations is insanity  i think that pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization   i cant really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but  he is certainly not entitled to it  pocklington has sucked revenue out of the oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests pocklington is not to be trusted  i doubt very much that any oiler team will ever again make the playoffs under pocklingtons stewardship as soon as a player shows himself to be a competent nhler and expects to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or draft picks      cordially as always                      maynardramseycslaurentianca                                             so many morons rm                                                 and so little time   
  detroit april 00  most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the detroit red wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to  another easy victory over the best team in the nhl   for the best goaltender in the world felix potvin six was a bad number as he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse to the goon tactics employed by the inferior red wings team   alan  ps we told you this would happen roger didnt we i love it  
   in article 00apr00000000000000vm0mcgillca jbe0 jbe0musicbmcgillca writes aargh  paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the nhl he called a total of 0 penalties on the habs and one on the nordiques the nords penalty came in ot  stewart being an exnordique himself was looking to call penalties on the habs while letting the nords get away with murderwe was robbed  if my powerplay was as bad as montreals id be thanking stewart for calling as few penalties as possible quebecs powerplay is lethal and it is to their advantage to have a penaltyfilled game where they can clean up with their superior powerplay   montreal really lost that game and game 0 because patrick roy is well on his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs the man is truly overrated quebec has scored six goals on roy and four perhaps five  were quite stoppable   alan   
   what is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus wc  i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev zubov and andersson for  binghamton but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play  for springfield while nylander wanted to play for sweden the whalers allowed  the nhl to decide and the nhl chose the wcs how does this differ from the  rangers and oilers did the whalers have to go through the league or could  they have forced nylander to play in springfield  as long as a player is under contract to an organization he is obligated to play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission to play the rangers are certainly within their rights to force zubov and andersson to report to binghampton   it certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the ranger  organization however is having binghampton win the calder cup really more important to them than keeping their players happy   alan  
  and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded  resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other  team captain trivia would be appreciated  brad mccrimmon was the captain of the flames when he was traded to detroit following the 000000 season this was during the offseason though  theres countless examples of captains being traded im sure  alan

  hi guys  what happened 0  potvin didnt let six goals by 0  wendel and andreychuk woke up 0  home ice and lots of yelling in the gardens gave the leafs the emotional edge 0  refs calls especially last night tended to favour leafs  a couple of comments  0  on gilmour  just because the guy isnt one of the three stars doesnt mean he was not leading the team  someone posted the playoff point total and hes in something like fifth or sixth placeplus he walked away with the molson cup given for accumulating points from the three star selection during the regular season  0  on the officiating  ive heard gripes from both ends on this one  emotions are very high in this series  the rivalry is one of the stronger ones i know of  i do have to agree that the officiating last night was proleaf in general except for whoever missed that slash on gilmours hand  0  in general  i still think detroit has one of the better chances vs pittsburgh though i think the leafs would do better against the bluesbut not as well if they made it out of the division problem is i like both these teams though im supporting the leafs on the underdog principle  d  by the waygilmour tiring out is a lot like bob probert not playing aggressive hockey by the wayim not any sort of expert nor do i claim to be i just like watching a good matchup   tee hee heeooops susan

  while i will first congratulate the blues for their victory i think it must be realized that the primary reason the blues were able to win was curtis    joseph  when a goalkeeper gets hot there is little an opposing team can do joseph should be given the entire city of st louis because otherwise there  would probably be a game 0 scheduled    as for the game on sunday  the blues caught a few breaks without a doubt one was the referee constantly watching the blackhawks looking for reasons to give them penalties  second the blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the blackhawks attempted to clear  no linesman no shot for bretti can redirect anythinghull to redirect  on another of st louis goals belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didnt belong in the crease which means it was a st louis player finally the overtime goal was caused because someone kept belfour from getting back to the crease  no goalie no way to stop the shot  i congratulate st louis for beating the hawks  it will be a shame to see bryan murray finally advance to the campbell conference finals because joseph wont be able to stop the powerful red wing attack    the world reknown jason boskey            mail boskuiucedu             known throughout the world as the bosk   christ you know it aint easy all rights reserved all lefts enhanced  you know how hard it can be     the way things are goin         here they come spinning out of the turntheyre gonna crucify me

   i dont think hes shown that hes good enough to carry detroit to the cup the team may be good enough to reach the finals but cheveldae is their  achilles heel  you must have goaltending in the playoffs and  cheveldae looks like an overmatched 0nd or 0rd stringer which he probably    i guess i dont know of too many 0nd or 0rd string goalies that could post  over 00 wins in a season  chevy has done that the past two seasons playing   behind a defense that is not exactly the best in the league  his 00 wins   this year were not all against toronto and for those who look at vincent rien  stats and think he should be starting take a look at the teams he played  against teams like san jose ottawa and tb any nhl goalie could post a decent  record playing teams like that night in and night out   is  look for detroit management to remedy the situation in the offseason    i really dont see this happening  if they didnt think cheveldae could do the  job they would of traded for somebody this year after all why wait until next  year when there were goalies available this year   hey i may be wrong but after watching him kick rebound after rebound into the high slot i dont think he can carry them in the tough games ie those not against toronto    better to kick out rebounds than to let goals in  if st louis gets past chicago watch for joseph to carry the blues past an otherwise vastly superior red wings club   joseph is hot but so are the wings  they have scored six goals in both of  their games so far with toronto supposively one of the leagues best defenses  i guess if they end up playing for the norris title well see what happens       drd the devils advocate        drinkin  women  guns dont mix  v000p0nkubvmsccbuffaloedu  awkorbutacsubuffaloedu                       mark arm      kcs    wings in 00 or hopefully by 00   as far as cheveldae is concerned he is a decent goalie  the most logical trade in the offseason to me would be between detroit and ny rangers  im sure if beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his roots in detroit  he would be a valuable asset to the wings and perhaps the rangers could get a zombo in return  beezer got a few good years in him and the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play

    did anyone see the montreal  quebec game yesterday  it was tight right down to the last second of the third period  in the overtime roy and hextall played like they were gods   ok so montreal won  they deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick  their second goal in overtime was also replayed but i could not tell if it was the montreal player who kicked it in  the puck definitely was not directed in by a stick anyways montreal is back into the series                                                        dave vergolini                                                 michigan state university                                                 vergolineulerlbsmsuedu  
   im just wondering where all the bruins fans are  i mean they woofed it  up with about 0000000 posts during the regular season saying that their  fave team was going to kick everyones  in the playoffs and win the stanley  cup  while i see nothing wrong with a little ranting and raving im just  curious why all the boston faithful have stopped posting  i mean i havent  even see just one little boston fan post cept for the bruins fans that  arent cocky  well maybe theyre all out on the golf course or something  but i dont know id sure like to see where all those bruins fans are at      robbie po           0000s streakers   we do what comes naturally  patrick division semis   pgh penguins  you see now wait for the  penguins 0 devils 0     0000 0000 stanley possibility dont you see a  penguins lead 00       cup champions   strong resemblancedg 00   here in the middle of connecticut there are plenty of bruin fans many who have let me know in no uncertain terms that the rangers choked down the stretch  i think the bruins are doing the same exact thing the rangers did theyre playing too tight  whos responsibility is it to check mogilny  he has gotten off a number of quality shots on goal of which there are many rebounds which are not being cleared by the bs defense  its too bad the bs might not get the opportunity to play pittsburgh again  i would really enjoy seeing ulfie get beat up by neely  we all hate ulfie but would love him on are team

  c liu says okay the caps again are about to break out the golf clubs but before they do does anyone have the history of the washington capitals futility record in the playoffs i remember that terrys first year was the first  dont give up so soon  a lot of burgh fans didnt give up at 00 last year you gotta believe  hard as that may seem  with the caps with the 0 power play in the playoffs and 0 penalty killing according to mike lange all the caps have to do is make sure it doesnt go otas that was bostons and chicagos demise  ot can be a curse   
  good point  there havent even been any recent posts about ulf  secretly im convinced that hes responsible for the bs being down 00 to buffalo somehow  
    ok buffalo fans  i am a red wings fan but am amazed at how the sabres are beating up on the bruins  is there any reason for this  is it grant fuhr or mogilny and lafontaine  i would like to hear from you since i do not know much about the sabres                                                      dave vergolini                                                 michigan state university                                                 vergolineulerlbsmsuedu  
    id like to echo these sentiments  this is the worst coverage i can  ever remember seeing on cbc  as soon as the game ends i can count to 00  and by that time theyve signed off the air  no post game interviews  no updating of late scores nothin  tsn is really putting cbc to  shame  i only hope the later round coverage improves i mean who  really wants to see cbc primetime news instead of hockey   my 00   darren  this was a concession to mansbridge and cbc news they argued that if youre going to play  havoc with the schedule you should  at least make sure that prime time is aired as soon as possible news got a commitment that the postgame show would be scrapped and that the network would go to ptn within one minute or so of the game  ending  as for the earlier comments about cbc being ontariocentric frankly the no doubleheader decison goes both ways people in the west cant  see the leafs  and people in central canada cant see the jets game the reason for the decision was cbcs feeling they couldnt sell advertising for six hours of hockey in  one night   as for who wants to see news over hockey a lot of people cbc always gets plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule       darren reiniger                   reinigerugcsdalca  arishemacdalca  centre for marine geology dalhousie university halifax ns canada  people who wonder where this generation is going should remind themselves   where it came from in the first place   
    there was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams no matter ow bad they are thats bullshit anyone who would follow the pens or the pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are losers its ok to follow and be concerned about your home team but to  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true fana  true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team  when i visit pittsburgh ill refuse to go to a pirates game since i think the management has given pittsburgh a team which could have been much better even if they couldnt sign barry bonds lerts say the pens start doing to their own team what the oilers have done this year and what the whalers have done in recent years i would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the team ill still follow it and bitch about it but i wont waste my money on mediocre teams  pravin ratnam

    oh yeahand i can go to the arena and see not one not two but six championship banners hanging from the rafters  0 stanley cup banners and 0 avco cup banners  my nhl guide says that vancouver has won the cup once as many times as the rockin town of kenora has won it  dont let this confuse anybody  the winnipeg jets have never won the stanley cup or even come that close  these stanley cup championships go back a long way to about the turn of the century  the winnipeg victorias won one or more of these cups the jets didnt win any of them  can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff series going on today than who won more stanley cups around the turn of the century  lets face facts  the canucks are leading the series 00  the canucks dominated the jets in their season series  the canucks did better in the regular season than winnipeg  who is the better team  i think that the facts show that vancouver is better than winnipeg  gregmeister  
  watch out pitsburgh here come the isles    they said we wouldnt make the playoffs and we came in third they said the caps would beat us and theyre not going to they say that pitsburgh has a 00 ratio of winning the cup but well prove them wrong   l e t s   g o    i s l a n d e r s  bring it back home

  ua000freenetvictoriabcca tom moffat says  if the oilers move to hamilton what division will they play in   and wont they have to change their name to the steelers or something the only significant deposits of oil around hamilton are those caused by the tire fire a  few years back  then again if the nba can have the utah jazz or the la lakers think about it what lakes are in la then i guess the nhl can have the hamilton oilers

  shim a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best i can   here in the hockey hinterlands oklahoma  im hoping i can get a   reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas  shive been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly   the hockey state in the us  so why is the team moving to a city in   texas  is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or   were the stars really not making a profit  or was the city or whoever   owned the arena doing some price gouging  shas much as id like to see the nhl only a 0 hour drive from me i   cant help but feel for the people in minnesota unless they truly   didnt support the team  shopinions please  i used to work for the stars  minnesota supported the team to an extent  when i was there we had quite afew sellouts this was the season after the cup run and during the finals  norms main bitch was that there wasnt enough luxury suites  and the ones he had were not always full  he wanted more boxes and wanted them full  he was just asking for too much from people that could go and see other hockey games at high schools for 0 or college for about 00 that would probably be better  mark   þ qmpro 000 000000 þ radioactive cats are very very hot    origin origin line not defined in goedit 00000000  
  here is something crossposted from the ahl mailing list  in a discussion between me and chris lerch the subject of springfields  0st round upset of the providence bruins came up chris basically raised the possibility that the ahl  hierarchy is biased in favor of the indians he noted that the offices for the league are in spring and many exindians are working for the ahl furthermore he also informed me that back a few years ago in the cup  finals between roch and spring that the amerks charged favoritism by the office and that  there were little questionable things liket he ahl president and staff attending all games with the springfield brass including sitting in their box for the game in springfield and according to the rochester media openly cheering for springfield  certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this is true i dont know if this is anything more than whining on the part of the amerks they have pulled this sort of crap against the wings before but if true this is somthing that seriously raises questions about president jack butterfields leadership  btw this was posted with the permission of chris            bri farenellfarenebtcraftcampclarksonedu         ahl ecac and boston bruins contact for recsporthockey         adirondack red wings calder cup champs 00  00  00  00         clarkson hockey ecac tournament champs 00  00  00         glens falls high hockey ny division ii state champs 00  00             ahl fans join the ahl mailing list ahlnewsrequestandrewcmuedu        
   this comes indirectly from al morgani who works in the studio for espn hockey  the management of espn was reluctant to leave the pittnj game  even though the outcome was certain because of fear of the washny game  going to overtime  when the caps scored with 00 left to tie the game al said he heard many people say fk    espn is under contractual obligation to show baseball and could not broadcast the ot of the hockey game  next year espn0 will be introduced so  baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey  get off espns back and stop posting articles on this subject there have been to many fn complainers about this game that its making me sick  geoff filinuk

  caldwell0000mtroyalabca writes   detroit april 00  most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the detroit red wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to another easy victory over the best team in the nhl  for the best goaltender in the world felix potvin six was a bad number as he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse to the goon tactics employed by the inferior red wings team                                                                  alan  ps we told you this would happen roger didnt we i love it            where is roger anyway  havent heard from him in awhile  he must be out on the golf course waiting for the leafs to join him any day now         laurie marshall wayne state university detroit michigan go wings  
  roots in detroit  he would be a valuable asset to the wings and perhaps the rangers could get a zombo in return       wake up and smell the norris  rick zombo was traded to the blues for vince riendo sp last season     mike     
    as far as cheveldae is concerned he is a decent goalie  the most logical  trade in the offseason to me would be between detroit and ny rangers  im sure  if beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his  roots in detroit  he would be a valuable asset to the wings and perhaps the  rangers could get a zombo in return  beezer got a few good years in him and  the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play    only problem is that zombo was traded to st louis last year for goalie vincent riendeau  i think that while chevy is not among the elite class of goalies he is adequate given the offensive firepower of the wings  greg  
  grogersslacvxslacstanfordedu greg rogers writes  hi all  due to living in the bay area i as unable to see vancouvers victory over the jets last night  i know the score but that rarely describes the game could someone please post a brief sonapsis sp of waht happened  how well did each team play  were the cannucks deserving of the victory       well in my opinion the canucks played a really strong game i was especially pleased by a very strong game from linden  i think he could be a key to success for them this year  defensively they really had a strong game  hardly heard selannes name all night craven also played one of his best games since coming over  with a few exceptions they really didnt let the highflying jets do much highflying  i thought the jets defence looked overmatched by the canucks forwards  they will have to improve on that if they want to make this a series      in short it was a great start    chris roney  email chrisroneysfuca  
  the jets gave the canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as vancouver outscored winnipeg 00 the pattern of the first game was repeated tonight with the canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period only to stave off a jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent the jets looked more dangerous in this one but it didnt make a difference in the  numbers that counted goals vancouvers big line produced again with centre cliff ronning and left winger geoff courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to  boost the canucks to a 00 lead on giveaways by the suspect jet defence of bautin and ulanov mental lapses by the defence and goalscoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three canuck goals however as in the first game the jets worked hard to take the game to the canucks in the second period the jets dominated the second checking hard and penetrating the vancouver zone without being challenged by a canuck team that wanted to pack it in early  the hard work paid off late in the second when tie domi caught vancouver goalie kirk mclean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score 00  domis goal gave the jets new life as they began to take the rush to the canucks collapsing defence the canucks were unwilling to do  anything but let mclean take shots and clear the rebounds the jets were allowed to set up and make plays both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably mclean made three great saves in the second off a dancing teammu selanne while essensa was rocked by a pavel bure drive selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the jets pressed a series of attacks into the canuck zone the canucks on the other hand looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead a series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the jets in the early third the jets tempo numminen drove a puck from the point through mcleans legs and into the net to tie the game at 00 the canucks discordant play picked up where it left off this was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the jets and individual rushes into a tight winnipeg defence that were never supported however as in the first and second canuck goals a jet defensive lapse re bonehead play stalled the winnipeg comeback with the faceoff in the winnipeg zone pavel bure was left to stand in the crease with no jet defender anywhere near him bure who had been invisible in the game up to that point took a rebound and managed to roof it with a  backhand even though he was off balance  by then it was too late for the jets to come back essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack canucks 0 winnipeg 0 next game is friday at winnipeg with the jets in the hole by two games  00

   dean j falcione posting from jrmst0pittedu writes i wrote  when the pens got mario granted there was big publicity etc etc and interest was immediately generated  gretzky did the same thing for la  however imnsho neither team would have seen a marked improvement in attendance if the team record did not improve  in the year before lemieux came pittsburgh finished with 00 points  following his arrival the pens finished with 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 and 00 points with a couple of                            stanley cups thrown in        it was at this point the pens attendance was near capacity 00 out of 00  sellouts yet they hadnt made the playoffs since 0000  how do you explain a 0th place team breaking attendance records when they havent been to the playoffs in 0 years  mario lemieux is the explanation imho    you could make a case that the expectation of an improving team that would make the playoffs is the reason   funny you should mention itthis is exactly the case i was going to make  but i think the reason is lemieux had a 000 point season and was the first nongretzky to win the hart and ross since 0000  people turned out to watch him play   i will grant that a star like mario will draw fans even if the team sucks  but this is short term only i still do not think the attendance increase  will last unless the team is a winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking one  pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support them  if they suddenly dropped to say 00 points youd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon    also the following year 0000 the pens had 00 points not 00   ok  my numbers came from the nhl guide and record book   they made the transaction to try and build a winner around mario that is  true  but the improvement in attendance came before they started doing this coffey late in 0000 and before they even had a playoff bound team a doubling of attendance occured in 000000 from the previous year  an increase from 00 points to 00 points is not going to do that  the arrival of mario lemieux is what did it   you can give the credit to mario since he deserves it  but my point is that it wasnt mario himself but it was the expectation of things to come ie a winning team that he created by being the next great hockey superstar and before anybody jumps in and says im nitpicking and mincing words go back and read from where this thread started  it might help to think about what would go through a fans mind who suddenly found an interest in mario and the pens  was it gee mario lemieux is amazing ill go watch him play or was it gee now weve got a kick ass guy on our side ill go watch him play  i think it was the latter   similar thing happened in la   before gretzkys arrival about 00000 per game  after constant sellouts  they are still selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement since gretzkys first year there  how do you explain it  people are going to see gretzky  they certainly arent going to see a winner they havent got a winner  theyve had much better teams in their past history than they currently have yet they didnt draw as well then  i dont think this is accurate  the tickets sell but people dont go to the games  i think this thread has already been discussedseason ticket holders in la dont always use their tickets  so in effect after the kings initial success following gretzkys arrival 00 to 00 points same source and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much    whether or not the kings are a winner is debatable  i claim that since gretzkys arrival they have at the very least been competitivei also claim that mcnall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the oiler dynastybut thats another story and included only because i dont like mcnall  anyway  mcnall did do some heavy marketing around gretzky and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales etc  but as i said when the kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the forum even if the tickets were sold  i think in the case of a lemieux or gretzky the player can transcend winning as the major drawing power    for the short term imo  although i think that its inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as lemieux or gretzky simply because they make people around them better  but winning sure as hell helps    well at least we are in full agreement here  this does not make rogers point any more valid but the jets arent  so are you saying roger has ever had a valid point couldnt resist  getting a huge jump in productivity yet they are getting a huge jump in attendance  this is due to the emergence of teemu selanne they have the 00th best record in hockey it sure as hell isnt because they are winning  yes but they are doing no worse than last year  i think the same type of reasoning i applied to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at winnipeg games  its difficult to predict but do you think that if the jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels  i seriously doubt it because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without selanne  i did provide the example of rocket ismail and the toronto argonauts of the  cfldid you leave it out because you dont know much about the cfl  if  thats the case then fair enough but if it isnt the case then im curious to hear your explanation    
   the jets use the breakaway pass scheme to create a scoring sensation in order to generate interest  if teams score as many or more goals against winnipeg when selanne is on the ice as winnipeg scores when he is on the ice then i cant see how his contribution can be described as impressive    implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against winnipeg with selanne on the ice can be blamed on himroger he is a forward  winnipeg has a lousy defensive record anyway  lets put it another way  john cullens  is terrible  whats your excuse for him  that his powerplay points dont count  neither do selannes   the object of the game is not to feed selanne  it is  to win  and feeding selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way to winning  knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that feeding selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to winning   pat burns wouldnt have a goal suck like this on his team  youre worried about teemu when you have glenn anderson on your team  we dont know what selanne does best  we do know what jets management wants  and again the object of the exercise is not to allow selanne to do what he does best it is to win hockey games  what he does best is scoreso i refer you to my comment above  as it is now selanne is a grandstanding goal suck  did you see the way he parades around with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal  you would think the messiah had returned  nope didnt see it  i was too busy watching foligno jump up and down after his goal     
  i can only comment on the kings but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is alex zhitnik he came highly touted as a defensive defenseman but hes clearly much more than that great skater and hard shot though wish he were more accurate in fact he pretty much allowed the kings to trade away that huge defensive liability paul coffey kelly hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with but at best hes only a mediocre goaltender a better choice would be tomas sandstrom though not through any fault of his own but because some thugs in toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal other than that the award goes to robert lang an uninspiring czech robitaille could easily be mvp but id prefer to give it to rob blake who is quietly becoming one of the leagues premier defensemen and if the kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense it could one day mean that well let in fewer goals than hartford honorable mentions to majestic marty and warren rychel jon

  well i gotta tell ya  last nights leafs game vs the devils was a nailbitter let me tell you it was a well played game by both teams i thought but according to the don and ron it was the an offnight for the leafs and the devils  were outplaying toronto well i beg to differ  imho clark deserved to be a first star as much as gilmour did his fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the clark of old but not to take any of the credit away from gilmour  i think the leafs are playing great hockey why  well first look at their injury list which includes cullen ellet zezel macoun of course my question is thishow will the leafs fare when they are once again healthy if they are playing this well so far  second just look at their standings still second in defence moved from 00th overall to 0th over in the last month havent lost at home in last 00 games 0 game undefeated streaketc btw am i wrong or was this potvins first shutout i cant  remember him having any as of yet  well as of april 0 we see that the race for first in the norris has truly begun and it will be a very close race between chicago and toronto and the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one  coming to the stretch and still a roarin go leafs go       alfred yongjeh yim                    toronto wins the     0b mathematics actuarial science                    cup   university of waterloo canada         i like cocacola idea personally   email ayimdescarteswaterlooedu

  says the precedent was set by the wha in their first season  they used a red puck for exhibition games and a blue one for the regular season thankfully they abandoned it in favour of black before the next season began   one reason that the wha abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it crumbled very quickly during play  the blue dye that was used somehow affected the vulcanized rubber of the puck decreasing its cohesiveness  terry u00000uicvmuicedu

   hi  according to my always questionable newspaper theres a silver dollar being minted in canada the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the stanley cup  now i know full well what coins are used every day in canada  i can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now in fact  my question is since the loon is the only dollar coin that i know is legal tender is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value or what  is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet with no chance of it being circulated  if it is an uncirculated coin whats the current cost and whats its potential value  just curious  if no one knows ill take this to socculturecanada and reccollecting or whatever it is  thanks again    valerie hammerlsome days i have to remind him hes not  hammerlacsubuffaloedumario lemieux  herb brooks on claude acscvjhubmsccbuffaloedulemieux top scorer for the devils but  v000pwwpzubvmsccbuffaloedu  known for taking dumb penalties

   okay you hockey playing fansfinatics out there im looking over the wide  range of aluminum sticks for the first time ive been playing with pieces of lumbar that seem to weigh alot and break after a few uses so im  thinking of changing to an aluminum shaft so when i break the blade all i  have to do is change it the problem is that there is such a wide reange of models and selections out there that im not certain which to consider can any of you post some of your suggestions and experiences with the aluminum  sticks what is the difference between models what do you likedislike about them and which brands are best    ive had and still have a few aluminum sticks  i got my first when i was 00 a christian and broke the shaft halfway through the season two years  later  i bought another a canadian at the beginning of the next season  and i still have it  i also have an easton that a friend was getting rid  off after giving up the game  i find that easton blades are easier to get  but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable  watch out for  dried up bits of firewood that some stores pass off as blades  in my  experiences the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks  but ive only ever broken one aluminum shaft  i like aluminum sticks  the blades are quickly changed even on the bench  if you have to  on the downside the shaft wont break if you decide to  impale yourself on it   ciao mark s  this is between me and the vegetable    rick moranis in                                            little shop of horrors mark shoesmith shoephysicswatstaruwaterlooca

   stephen legge sleggekeanucsmuncca writes i was wtahcing right guard hockey week on tsn yesterday and they had a feature on this guy that does a lot most of the masks for nhl goalies  they talked about how they are made what they are made of and the designs that are put on them etc  actually this part was really interesting  it turns out that the mask is customfit to the goalies face  the goalie puts hisher face through a piece of wood or was it plastic with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show  hair is covered by a cap eyes are covered by a plastic wraptype material and vaseline is put on the goaltenders face  then a plaster is spread on their cheeks forehead and chin which takes about 00 minutes to dry sufficiently  when it dries it is effectively a mold of the goalies face  this is used as the basis of the mask the rest involves padding the inside hardening the exterior fitting the cage etc etc   john blue of the bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show   he exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on namely a new mask for andy moog which is a basic reworking of his current mask with the bear on it and new mask for bob essensa which was  really cool  the jets logo was on the chin and there were two fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an airbrushed background  yeah essensas mask looked really good   the best one of all was one he never talked about he just held it up it has the current leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking  black panther on the forehead  it has to be a new mask for felix potvin but he never said whose it was  actually i thought i heard him say that it was potvins for certain  i would bet money on it either wayand it did look awesome   dchhabrastplistsca

   allancsualbertaca allan sullivan writes  before i begin lambasting don cherry let me first say that ive been sort of a cherry fan for a whileadmittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly but hes moreorless harmless  on saturday however he crossed the lines of good taste  according to don the entire article wasnt perfect and there were some shots by frank musil and alpo suhonen  don noted that musil wasnt much of a player didnt score many goals last year he also made fun of their names one guy has a name like dog food the other like a laxitive metamusil  this is the best he can do  gee don tremendous amounts of professionalism here  the cbc looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with this nonsensemaking fun of names  its bad enough that he makes asinine blanket statements about european players but hes now resorted to making fun of their names too  he sounded like an idiot much like he did last week when he said that teemu would never make it to his rock em sock em video until he dropped the gloves  on the subject of realignment don said that he liked the new division names  well what he said was that even though hes been around the league for quite some time he still doesnt know whos where wrt conference and division names  hello mcfly  the names have been around for a couple of decades or sohe also invited the audience to name the teams in the walesquick quick followed by ah you dont know i dont know    sorry don  wrong on this one  ron to don i dont know wy i like you on your show for 00 minutes i can hardly stand you on this show for 0  this was absolutely hilarious  dons argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly goodunfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in the nba case  serious moneyoh well hes never been one for objectivity has he  dons question to gretzky  wouldnt it be better for you to change your friends so that they like the game than for us to change the game for your friends  now this i liked    
  tsn sportsdesk just reported that the ottawa sun has reported that montreal will send 0 players  00 million including vin damphousse  and brian bellows to phillidelphia phillie will send eric lindros to ottawa and ottawa will give its first round pick to montreal   if this is true it will most likely depend on whether or not ottawa gets to choose 0st overall  can ottawa afford lindros salary   personally i cant see philli giving up lindros  for anything   they didnt give away that much to quebec just to trade him away  again  not to mention that lindros seems to be a huge draw in phillie  and that he represents a successful future for the  franchise   ottawa may be better off taking the 0 players 00 from montreal for the pick   stephen legge sleggekeanucsmuncca

   did you ever notice how many people on the net have trouble in the comparitively easy task of spelling the nick name of our fair city  i never knew that philadelphia becomes phillie or philli when spoken of  so for all you who dont know yet heres a little clue  it is spelled       p h i l l y  okthank you  oh yeah about that druginduced trade rumori dont think the sniders are that stupidthe rumor you should be looking into is mike keenan coming back to coach the flyers  later  mike    mike cornell      there are a great many people in the country today who mac00pocwruedu  through no fault of their own are sane monty python  lets go flyers  stanley cup in 00  oh my brain hurts mr d p gumby  
       the adams division race is certainly interesting this year  here are  important data to keep in mind in the eventuality of a tie for a given  standing position    in head to head games  quebec wins over montreal 000  boston leads against quebec 000 with two games remaining  montreal and boston are tied 000 with one game remaining                  pierre breton   aka fluide glacial  pierre for purposes of the tie breaker you only count the first three games in each city therefore quebec cannot possibly be ahead of montreal 00 and theres probably only one game that counts remaining between boston and quebec which means boston has probably already won  pete clark  rsh flyers contact

         heres the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl i am sick of watching a game between an american and a canadian team lets say the red wings and the canucks and seeing names like bure konstantinov and borshevshky is this north america or isnt it toronto detriot quebec and edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of euros on other teams is getting worse as well        i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about pavel bure the russian rocket i will completely throw up as it is now every time i see the canucks play i keep hoping someone will crosscheck bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher by the way im not a canucks fan to begin with         okay the stretcher remark was a little carried away but the point is that i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians and some americans it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their north american league and instead gives it to europeans who arent even better hockey players its all hype this european mystique is sickening but until nhl owners get over it canadian and american players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league       with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating the problem is clearly only getting worse       im all for the creation of a european hockey league and let the bures and selannes of the world play on their own continent       i just dont want them on mine     ah so now were into european player bashing  what next   no more french canadiens  yeah theres an idea  let them french speaking canadiens have their own hockey league  we dont want them are you crazy  the nhl is one of the true international leagues and yes there are many europeans who deserve to play in the nhl and are better than some north americans look at teemu i for one am glad to see europeans in the nhl and i hope the nhl soon expands to europe  its nice to see all these different people come together to form the soon to be 00 hockey teams        richard j rauser        you have no idea what youre doing rausersfuca            oh dont worry about that were professional wni                          outlaws  we do this for a living  remember no matter where you go there you are drbanzai  darryl brooks                    university at buffalo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             go bills sabres and magic

      in the smythe this one is the toughest for me to call because i have to put personal bias aside go calgary  i think a lot depends on who wins the division  winnipeg will move into third by the end of the season and the first place winner will have a clear advantage it will be a lot easier to build momentum against a team like the kings  whoever plays the kings in the first round will take the division  much as it hurts i have to pick division winner  vancouver canucks  ill have to disagree with you on this one i think vancouver will go as bure goes and if he continues on his goal scoring slump then they wont even make it out of the first round i think the kings will make it out of the first round regardless of who they play they seem to be doing pretty well even with that bad game against minnesota on saturday i think itll be either calgary or los angeles to win the smythe ie go on to the conference finals   wales conference trophy islanders and bruins will fight to the end but i think the islanders have enough steam to overtake the bruins in seven  campbell conference trophy a walk for vancouver maybe in 0 or 0 but definately not 0  stanley cup final islanders and vancouver  islanders will have nothing left by this point and will succumb fairly easily to the canucks  stanley cup champion vancouver canucks  still have to disagree with you here i think itll be pittsburg to get the hat trick in stanley cups they just look toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good   i hope you have enjoyed my predictions  i hope they are not all correct go calgary  neither do i well may the best team win it all pittsburg thats just my 00 worth     message from the terminal of carol boudreau  boudreauathenamitedu

    the flyers team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the spectrum sunday night and dominated the maple leafs thoroughly en route to a 00 shutout tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs from mounting any serious attack  injuries  pelle eklund is daytoday with a bruised thigh  roster moves  jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game jason was the flyers second pick in the first round 00th overall of the 0000 entry draft 00 years old 00 000 lbs in 00 games with the tricity americans he had 00 goals 00 assists and 000 pim he plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although bobby taylor said that bill dineen was planning to use him up front as well  andre faust was returned to hershey he actually left after the second period of the kings game flew to albany got the game tying goal in a bears ot win and played again for hershey sunday night  lines  fedyklindrosrecchi beranekbrindamourdineen lomakinbutsayevconroy actonbrown  galleymcgill yushkevichcronin carknerhawgood bowen  tommy soderstrom in goal  acton replaced lomakin in the 0rd period  game summary  if the flyers played like this every night theyd be in the playoffs this year the flyers hit everything that moved they created scoring chance after scoring chance they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do  jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found brindamour crashing the net on the other side a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppas body should have been a goal but puppa made a great save reading the play  garry galley gave the maple leafs 0th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked doug gilmour at 000 the flyers lowly 00st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill the maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every rebound  after the power play the flyers got a goal on an ugly play rod brindamour gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef beranek and bob rouse who were wrestling in the slot beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over puppa for a 00 flyers lead at 000  the flyers kept the pressure on and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers from building on their lead for a while eventually things settled down and defense prevailed each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were strong bowen started giving some lindroslike checks in his own corners then lindros who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the score he had foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice boards the only problem was that foligno was a little far from the boards and mike mister mcgeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 0000  the leafs couldnt get anything going on the power play as the flyers were very aggressive for a change on the kill  with time running out in the period recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to lindros as they approached the leafs blue line they were in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros tried a backhand pass to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi but then clark checked recchi off the puck macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to mcgill who had manned the point he drove it from just inside the blue line macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 00000 shots were 000 flyers in the period  the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk tripped up rod brindamour in his offensive zone during the power play the flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric gloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head we could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end as time was running out in the advantage lindros found galley with a pass across the goal mouth but puppa made the save the rebound kicked back to the right corner where recchi picked it up passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle and eric onetimed past puppa at 000 with the assist recchi moves past bobby clarkes 0000 season the second best one season total for a flyer at 000  eric moves up to 0th all time in flyers rookie scoring with 00 points  mike eastwood took down al conroy at 000 to give the flyers another chance on the power play not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with a slash at 000 not much happened on the 0 on 0 although the leafs had most of the possession the flyers smothered the leafs short power play tempers flared a little at 0000 bowen and pearson got roughing minors keith acton got a bloody face dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a hooking minor at 0000 to set up a 0 on 0 the replay showed that hawgoods stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyers smothered the leafs power play led by dimitri yushkevich bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot he made all the flyers look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stoned him  the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didnt get anything home shots were 0000 flyers  the flyers were content with the 0 goal lead in the third period and they decided that if tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a little  the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first 0 or so minutes of the period but couldnt get past puppa then the leafs got tired of lindros making road kill out of them and tempers flared 0 each for doug gilmour and lindros  unsportsmanlike conduct and 0 each for glenn anderson and mcgill roughing all at 000 terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 000 on gilmour  again the flyers smothered the leafs power play  at about the 00 minute mark dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through soderstrom the puck was rolling on its side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other seconds later rod brindamour tripped up gilmour at 0000 to give the leafs another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom stoned andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout  recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 0000 no punches thrown recchi got the initial minor krushelnyski baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors at 0000 rouse and beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 0 each for slashing to set up another 0 on 0 mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers zone as they were battling for the puck and while mcgill was down he ran his stick across mcgills face the flyers were not happy with that at all 00 al conroy paired up with 00 berehowski and started throwing punches upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and al got a standing o penalties eastwood 0 cross check  game clark carkner 00 each berehowski and conroy 0 each fighting at 0000  so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers the had no interest in stting on the lead hawgood galley and brindamour played catch until hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past puppa at 0000  that was all the fireworks tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppa did but kept the flyers off the board 00 flyers shots were 00 flyers in the 0rd probably the strongest game ive seen from the flyers since the all star break shutout number 0 for soderstrom all since 000 tied for 0nd most in the nhl but hes played fewer games than belfour 0 or the goalie i cant remember that hes tied with  next up its the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyers cannot be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end  flyers up to 00 points on the season in 00 games last year they had 00 points in 00 games 0 under 000 so they need at least 0 points in their last 0 games to improve on that only by percentage points 0 under in 00 is better than 0 under in 00  tragic number holds at 0 points with 0 games left the tragic number for 0th is 0 points i watched the rangers blow a 00 third period lead at home to lose 00 before i finished this up why 0 points instead of 0 well the flyers will win the tiebreaker if they catch them whereas the islanders win tie breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie the rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the devils the pens twice the flyers and finish up with 0 games against the caps so i guess 0th place could be the goal for the team to focus on

  says  also sprach sleggekeanucsmunca   tsn sportsdesk just reported that the ottawa sun has reported that montreal will send 0 players  00 million including vin damphousse and brian bellows to phillidelphia phillie will send eric lindros to ottawa and ottawa will give its first round pick to montreal  if this is true it will most likely depend on whether or not ottawa gets to choose 0st overall  can ottawa afford lindros salary  personally i cant see philli giving up lindros  for anything they didnt give away that much to quebec just to trade him away again  not to mention that lindros seems to be a huge draw in phillie  and that he represents a successful future for the franchise  ottawa may be better off taking the 0 players 00 from montreal for the pick  stephen legge sleggekeanucsmuncca  two things  0 didnt the trade deadline pass two weeks ago  0 the flyers would never ever ever give up lindros simple as that  0 with soderstrom and roussel why the hell would the flyers want to    pick up an older and slumping roy  byw i could come up with a group of players theyd trade for but they wouldnt be from the same team  go flyers cup in 00  mike  yesrushmarillionelpgenesisking crimsondream theaterbeatles  mike weintraub aka jvi on irc              courageous convictions   mweintramericanedu                         will drag the dream      jediwavecerfnet                           into existence          the american university washington dc         rush not limbaugh  go philadelphia flyers vancouver canucks  philadelphia phillies                                            john e runski                                            jer000psuvm  
     i was thinking about who on each of the teams were the mvps biggest  surprises and biggest disappointments this year now these are just  my observations and are admittedly lacking because i have not had an  opportunity to see all the teams the same amount anyway      mvp  most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and        in terms of leadership cant win without him      biggest surprise  the player who rose above expectation  the player        that may have raised the level of his game to a new height even        if that new level doesnt necessarily warrant an allstar berth        includes those players who at the outset of the season may not        even have been in the teams plans       biggest disappointment  the player from whom we expected more eg i        picked denis savard in montreal because with the new emphasis on        offence brought by demers shouldnt savard have done better                                     team           biggest       biggest  team                   mvp          surprise    disappointment    boston bruins           oates          dsweeney     wesley  buffalo sabres          lafontaine     mogilny       audette jinx  calgary flames          roberts        reichel       petit  chicago blackhawks      roenick        ruuttu        goulet  detroit red wings       yzerman        chaisson      kozlov  edmonton oilers         manson         buchberger    mellanby  hartford whalers        sanderson      cassells      corriveau  los angeles kings       robitaille     donnelly      hrudey  minnesota north stars   modano      tinordinot expected back  broten  montreal canadiens      muller         lebeau        savard  new jersey devils       stevens        semak         maclean  new york islanders      turgeon        kingfinally marois  new york rangers        messier        kovalev       bourque  ottawa senators         maciver        baker         jelinek  philadelphia flyers     lindrosrecchi fedykgalley  eklund  pittsburgh penguins     lemieux        toccheteven for him  jagr  quebec nordiques        sakicricci    kovalenko     pearson  san jose sharks         kisio          gaudreau      maley  st louis blues          shanahan       cjoseph      ron sutter  tampa bay lightening    bradley        bradley       creightonkasper  toronto maple leafs     gilmour        potvin        ellettanderson  vancouver canucks       bure           nedvedfinally    momesso  washington capitals     hatcher        bondracote   elynuik  winnipeg jets           selanne        selanne       druce        as i mentioned up top these are my impressions from where i sit i  would welcome any opinions from those fans nearer their teams in other  words anywhere away from a toronto newspaper       bryan  
     well here it is nhl in the year 0000 i got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and  although i initially thought i had just been taking too many too strong  drugs now it seems the realization has really begun  you can see the  league has already started to move to this direction     the walt disney conference anaheim mighty chipmunks    franchise name to be changed after each new  la kings                      hockey movie          la flames                   weve seen some of that san jose sharks san diego bruins tijuana red wings   detroits hockey team will follow its car industry dallas stars            houston oilers texas rangers seattle canucks     the norm green conference alabama white hawks biloxi blues tampa bay lightning miami blades helsinki jets        youve heard them starting getting used to the anthem montreal quebecois sp                 there will be no canada atlanta devils orlando penquins key west islanders hartford whalers                        the whalers will never move huh palm beach capitals    now that the anahaim team is becomming real im really beginning to believe the rest of the message  im sure the future will turn you into believers  too  after 0000 the nhl will abandond icerinks  its so expensive to cool  down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is  anyway  nhl will become a roller skating hockey league  that way it can  create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the  game in their back yards            i hope im just out of my mind         there wont really be a disney team in anaheim will there         the stars arent really moving

  davebthewhoeastsuncom dave brewer writes  in yesterdays fracus between rob ray and brent hughes was it the camera angle or was ray actually punching hughes where it appeared he was punching him for those that didnt see the game  it was several inches below the belt and he punched him there quite a few times dreadful  also why did poulin get four minutes   ive been watching  playing hockey for a good long time now and ive seen players with questionable tactics but never have i seen what ray did on sunday this guy gets my all time loser award its one thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck when they are down its another thing to have a fist fight with someones balls ray should be thrown out of the league what an ahole  steve

       heres the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl i am sick  of watching a game between an american and a canadian team lets say the  red wings and the canucks and seeing names like bure konstantinov and  borshevshky is this north america or isnt it toronto detriot quebec  and edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of euros on other  teams is getting worse as well      im sick too watching allamerican names like gretzky etc      which names you accept  sitting bull and dances with wolves       it is north america what are you doing here        jyri

  dvbick  writes    0 foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your     body or stick if you get 0 you are out for the game  ive never seen a game where one player has committed 0 penalties  something like this would require more attention by the referee     0 unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the     current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you     are thrown out of the game and fined    0 technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot     is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game    besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets 0 penalties  in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one  until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if heshe was in  the act of shooting when the foul ocured    this works well for several reasons first penalty shots are the most  exciting thing in hockey right so it follows that the more the better  next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can  take a commercial finally with only three penalties the network  announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall and  marv levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before  the pa announcer says it    but youre creating a scoring opportunity where there might not have been one before  i can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls but its obviously easier to score in basketball there are more opportunities  if a basketball team scores 000 points thats at least fifty chances made  the average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game and this is a total guess is probably around 00 and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 0 of them  you have some good ideas concerning the other penalties but i think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with  also later in the post you talked about how boring the nba game you attended was that play was stopped too often wouldnt your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game  matt att uva  
  i think that nhlpa 00 is the best video game available now of course many things could be done better but i really appreciate that the names of players are the real ones no matter if it lacks some logos i am still playing it since november leading different teams to the finals and making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring yesterday i won the title using toronto against hartford 0 games to two i played the playoffs in a 0 games fashion 0 minutes for each period and the best scorer and shooter was gilmour 000 shots if i remember well       iskander ayari     email  iskanderayariloriafr ou ayariloriafr

  messier is a joke this year  bad back not withstanding  his play is the reason the rangers will be on the golf course in a couple of weeks gartner is my choice  the guy works his butt off every game  kovalev  no surprise  hes played adequately but as bad defensively  kovalev is too talented a player to play for roger nielsonroger needs players who cant think for themselves and can only skate in straight lines up and down the ice  dudley and nielson are the only two coaches bad enough in the league to take talents like mogilny and kovalev and not know how to turn them into bure and selanne  as was predicted in preseason  perhaps hell pull an alex mogilny in a couple of years and surprise us then  zubov wasnt expected to make it out of the minors this season and owing to the number of injuries has proved to be a very pleasant surprise   get muckler as coach and kovalev will look like mogilny  the trouble with the rangers is that neil smith went out and got players like messier kovalev and graves who have been schooled in taking the game to their opponent and attacking while hiring coaches who are interested in ropeadope strategies  if you want the roger nielsons of the world to be your coach you dont go out and get a mark messier who is an old dog who cant learn new tricks from a known loser and you dont waste your draft picks on players like kovalev  gerald  gerald  
  major league baseball has told the blue jays and the expos not to sign oscar linares i think that is his name  linares has not defected as i pointed out mlb requires that the player defect first  canada does not have the restrictions against cubans that the us has and other major league teams have told the canadian teams that they would be very unhappy if the expos or the blue jays would do this  what a surprise  as long as the pool of talent is not accessible to all teams mlb wont let a few teams sign it  seems perfectly reasonable to me      cubans players would not have to defect to play in canada and could play the 00 home games for the expos and blue jays without any trouble  except that mlb wont allow it which is all i ever said  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

  no no no since all the penalties fall into three classes there should only be three penalties  0 foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your    body or stick if you get 0 you are out for the game  0 unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the    current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you    are thrown out of the game and fined  0 technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot    is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game  besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets 0 penalties in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if heshe was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured  these new rule changes are great  however i think that your rules are much too complicated  how will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has  and then we would even have to remember the names of the players in order to determine who drew the foul  and of course there will have to be new subpositions like the power center who just sits in the slot until the blue of course puck comes near him and the shooting defenseman and the point defenseman  finally well be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penaltyshot takers  since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled well be able to see ulf samuellson sp and tie domi miss penalty shots like crazy             keith kellerlets go rangers lets go quakers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs  next time you go over my head ill have yours on a platter  cmdr benjamin sisko 0000

    bryan smale smalehealthyuwaterlooca writes  i was thinking about who on each of the teams were the mvps biggest  surprises and biggest disappointments this year                             team           biggest       biggest  team                   mvp           surprise     disappointment    hartford whalers        sanderson      cassells      corriveau  my votes fwiw  team mvp pat verbeek he fans on 00 of goal mouth feeds but he still has  00 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary sp team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons honorable mention nick kypreos and mark janssens probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than mvp but kypreos 00 goals 000 pim has been the hardest working player on the team and janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker i guess i place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value  biggest surprise geoff sanderson he had 00 goals and 00 points last season as a center then moved to left wing and has so far put up 00 goals and 00 points he now has a new whaler record 00 power play goals most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle his garden spot honorable mention andrew cassels and terry yake the kiddie quartet of sanderson poulin nylander and petrovicky have been attracting the most attention but cassels is just 00 and will score close to 00 points this season he has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with sanderson yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 00 and will put up about 00 goals and 00 points this season yake like sanderson started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing  although lefty sanderson went to the left wing and righty yake went to the right side  biggest disappointment hands down john cullen cullen had a disasterous 00 point season last year his first full season after the trade cullen started the season off of summer back surgery and fell flat on his face appropriate since he spent all of his whaler career flat on his ass and whining about it cullen scored just 0 point on 00 games was a clubhouse malcontent commanded the powerplay to a 0 success percentage 00 with sanderson and sulked his way out of town worst of all his 0 year 0m contract had three years left to run so no one would give up any more than the 0nd round draft pick the  maple leafs offered to hartford honorable mention steve konroyd also subpar after signing a 0 year 00m contract eric weinrich who showed flashes of competence but overall has played poorly jim mckenzie who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now and frank pietrangelo who only seemed to play well when sean burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row  sg a real live hartford whalers season ticket holder stevegcadkeycom  
  for those leaf fans who are concerned the following players are slated for return on thursdays winnipegtoronto game      peter zezel john cullen    mark osborne and dave ellett are questionable to return on thursday  all regular players who were injured including dimitri mironov should be back for saturdays home game against the flyers

      heres the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl i am sick of watching a game between an american and a canadian team lets say the red wings and the canucks and seeing names like bure konstantinov and borshevshky is this north america or isnt it toronto detriot quebec and edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of euros on other teams is getting worse as well   gee youd think winnipeg would be tops on that list what with 0 regulars being european        i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about pavel bure the russian rocket i will completely throw up as it is now every time i see the canucks play i keep hoping someone will crosscheck bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher by the way im not a canucks fan to begin with    well being a jet fan i sometimes wish that bure would get knocked silly too  nothing serious just enough to keep him out of a game         okay the stretcher remark was a little carried away but the point is that i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians and some americans it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their north american league and instead gives it to europeans who arent even better hockey players its all hype this european mystique is sickening but until nhl owners get over it canadian and american players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league  in most cases the owners have very little to do with it  they give their general managers one order when it comes to the draftfind me the best players so that our team will win the stanley cup  whether that player is in kindersley saskatchewan or chelyabinsk russia if the gm believes him to be the better player the gm should be drafting him  where do you get off calling the nhl their league when referring to canadian players  it doesnt belong to them it belongs to the owners  the owners can do what they want  while a canadian content rule might be enforcable here in canada there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the us that the cfl sorry for the football reference didnt even try to push their import ratio rule on the sacromento goldminers  increasing the competition for the elite positions in most cases would make players better anyways  oh yeah and how many europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in north america  while there are some that play in the ahl or the ihl where thats an nhl teams primary farm club you dont hear of many europeans playing in the chl the echl or on the secondary farm teams in the ihl  ie the jets do have a few russian players in moncton but i dont believe there are any europeans in ft wayne so with all those teams there are plenty of positions for hockey players in north america       with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating the problem is clearly only getting worse      im all for the creation of a european hockey league and let the bures and selannes of the world play on their own continent      i just dont want them on mine  im in favour of the nhl being the league for the premier players in the world  ive grown up with europeans playing on my team and some of those players were the among the best in the world  from hedberg nilsson and sjoberg to selnne zhamnov and olausson and all those in between and to come i wouldnt have it any other way  daryl turner  rsh contact for the winnipeg jets  internet umturne0ccuumanitobaca   fidonet 0000000 or 00000  please route through 000000 tkachuk over to zhamnov up to selnne he shoots he scores  the jets win the cup  the jets win the cup essensa for vezina  housley for norris  selnne for calder

   somebody wrote id love to see a european nhl division but cant see it happen for some time theres simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several crucial markets like germany italy and france while sweden and finland probably cant afford to shell out 0000 for tickets the way americancanadian fans do call it the minnesota north stars effect scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local inexpensive hockey to the nhl the national hockey league should love the idea though paneuropean tv channels such as eurosport could bring in the millions the american networks likely never will pay  this brings up a question i asked myself no answer when it was mentionned that the nhl could expand in europe  would most of the northamericans now playing in the nhl be willing to play for a team in europe  i do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level i know i would but i am not a pro hockey player  when one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a european expansion could be achieved  remember these   lindros did not want to play in quebec for more than  reasons  nicholls  in edmonton  r courtnall wanted to be traded to la only  c lemieux said he would refuse to go to edmonton earlier this year  i know there are many noncultural reasons behind these but there is more   some american players who played for the expos complained about the french   fact and that the city was not quite like the other us cities  one   players wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could   not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in montreal  anybody knows what happened when all these us football players moved to london spain etc  for the one year of that new football league 0 years ago  i wonder what the players association thinks about going to europe  myself i would like to see some european teams but what would be  the best way to do it   marc  
  ee0iandrewcmuedu ethan z evans writes    of course penalties will have to be changed    roughingchauvanistic males being aggressive  slashingchauvanistic males venting frustration  fightingproof that males cannot cope with their feelings    no no no since all the penalties fall into three classes there should only be three penalties  0 foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your    body or stick if you get 0 you are out for the game  0 unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the    current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you    are thrown out of the game and fined  0 technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot    is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game  besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets 0 penalties in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if heshe was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured  this works well for several reasons first penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey right so it follows that the more the better next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can take a commercial finally with only three penalties the network announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall and marv levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the pa announcer says it  oh one other rule when a goal is scored 0000 times a period the play cannot resume until the pa announcer announces it this way the network can sneak in a few more commercials then once the pa announcer has told them who scored the tv announcer can tell you the viewer and even have a  chance of pronouncing his name right  seriously though i actually went to see a nba basketball game last week for the first time in my life i was amazed how boring it was the play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like freethrow shooting contests during the period of course the laker girls get to do their  routines at least 00 times during the game and not just between periods either there is a whistle every 00 seconds on average maybe less the game is 00 minutes with 0 minutes between quarters 00 and 00 and a 00 minute halftime and it still takes over 0 hours  the reason for this has to be tv there is plenty of room to throw in commercials and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening on tv basketball is fairly entertaining imho but it is better to watch it on tv than to be there if this is the road the nhl is following then it truly is a sad day  enough for now  dvb

  after watching the pengiuns all year and as many other teams as possible ive really noticed an increase in tom barassos cheap shots this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders ive also noticed that he usually gets away with it just as examples last night i noticed him elbowing scott stevens in the head which basically started the whole shoving match that got stevens scott and tocchet 0 minute minors he also kicked john mclean of course he wasnt called for that isnt kicking an automatic match penalty and 00 game suspension i think glenn anderson got one a few years ago for kicking gaetan duchesne in the chest theres no doubt in my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall hes also very good  how about that tocchet headbutt is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a nonkicking match penalty i cant remember anymore  oh the playoffs should be fun ralph   
  from anna matyas now if we could just clone chelioss personality and transplant it into all of the defensemen on the islanders capitals and devils   gerald   in other words you want to turn them all into assholes so they will spend lots of time in the penalty box and get lots of misconducts   and this comes from a chelios fan  yeah and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 00 minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the best defenseman in the league id take a whole team of chelioses if i could that way when one got a penalty the others could kill it  ralph   
  mattbhawksamsungcom matt brown writes more about the messiersamuelsson incident while this is true strictly speaking it was the rocksteady replicant who initially used his stick illegally to measure messiers ribcage there is no question in my mind from seeing the replay in slomo that ulf0000 was coming at messier with intenttohasta la vista in mind and should have been gone for that    i agree with rick that ulfs cross check wasnt illegal it was the kind  of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called slomos  sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are  besides if messier cant take the heat he should stay out of the kitchen  so staffan how is mattias timmander doing this year and any impression on markus czeriew lost my roster list on hammerby does it look like they will make it to the eliteserien for next year and then get stomped if markus goes to boston   well matt mattias timmander hasnt been playing with the modo elite league  team yet just the modo junior team so i predict he needs a few more years  here before he can join the bs i saw him play in the swedish championship  game for junior players this year and he played very well a physical game  but not the kind of rough stuff that ulfie does i suspect you would like to  have a ulf typeofplayer on the bs team too   as for mariusz czerkawski he has had a great season for hammarby in  division 0 he scored if i remember correctly 00 points this season  and then we have to keep in mind that a 00 point season in sweden is  considered very good due to the limited number of games mariusz is  djurgarden property he was just on loan to hammarby so he will play  in elitserien next season unless the bs can get him of course  i would say that mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to  watch in swedish hockey this season   staffan      staffan axelsson                  etxonssufsaericssonse      rsh contact for swedish hockey    
   well the patrick division got a little more interesting last night  the islanders lost in ot and the devils tied the pens  that means if the isles beat the devils on friday the will meet the caps in the playoffs  however i have some more comments on the islanders and hockey in general that i need to get off my chest   first of all with the islanders  backtoback lackluster performances against the whalers one may think that  the islanders are out of shape  these guys always suck wind in the 0nd period come on a little in the 0rd and run out of gas too soon  it is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost  anyway the games was pretty  wide open  the isles still have tons of trouble scoring  the whalers played  a golie in is 0st nhl start i think his name was lenarduzzi sp  his nhl  debut was the tuesday tie against the isles  like i mentioned before this  guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while until he misplayed a  mahlakov slap shot to go to ot  i say its because the isles dont shoot  correctly  has anyone else noticed this  also i think it is really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick vukota gets as much ice time as he does  this guy has about as much hockey talent as jiggs macdonald who did play hockey i think  anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties  richard pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap  and hes a defenseman  hes got to be approaching negative infinity for his plusminus  this guy gets beaten all the time  why the need for such enforcers  not only do fights slow the game down alot but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game  ill be one of the few to admit i do enjoy a  good fight once in a while but only when its called for  you know when a guy checks the goalie too hard  in other words a violation of hockey ethics might cause you to get puched  but there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 0rd and ot  i mean come on already  im sick of seeing teams pulling guys down holding guys etc just becuase the referee doesnt call it  ot and late in the 0rd should be a time for strategy not physical prowess  trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost  if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it you dont deserve to win in the first place  just my honest opinion  gary at hofstra accgsgvaxbhofstraedu accgsghofstrabitnet

  i didnt say every team must have a number of local players rather the european teams should get the chance to sign their top players before the rest of the league comes in i agree that birthplace isnt that important dusseldorfer eg of the german league average close to 00000 fans and they dont have a single germanborn forward lion milan made the european final four with fifteen canadianborn players but nationality is going to be an issue in sweden and finland i think we really need an issue preventing lindros and mario from ending up being drafted by a european team and vice versa player trades are a different matter  any player can end up anywhere after being drafted  deg has many germanborn forwards in the team in fact the majority of players are germanborn 000000 deg had 00000 average in 00000 spectator arena  my possiblenhleuropean leaguesite list switzerland   berne zurich lugano and 00 others germany       dusseldorf cologne berlin munich mannheim rosenheim sweden        stockholm gothenburg malmo gavle finland       helsinki turku tampere italy         milan france        paris chamonix ruoen norway        oslo austria       vienna villach chech         prag slovakia      bratislava russia        moscow st petersburg great britain  netherlands      petteri kortelainen

   on march 00 0000 roger maynard wrote in reply to an article by graham hudson   will still have the jennings trophy at the end of the year  potvin is very  good and i do believe that he will be a star but i want to see him  perform in the playoffs under pressure  you dont think he is performing under pressure now  the major differences  between playoff hockey and normal hockey is 0 play ing every other night which is physically exhausting and 0   you play  the  same  team  in a consecutive string of games  is this what you mean by pressure  have you even thought about what  you mean  by pressure or are your thoughts like most of the rest of this drivel simply halfbaked  this was 0000mar000000000000ramseycslaurentianca for anybody who would like to check  he went on in another article to say paraphrased  playoff hockey is just an expression used by announcers to convince simpleminded folks like yourself that what you are seeing is a better product than a regularseason game  now however in article 0000apr0000000000000ramseycslaurentianca  roger maynard writes  with a 00 win over a tough whaler squad the leafs showed all doubters what playoff hockey is all about      so roger what exactly is playoff hockey all about  or is it a convenient phrase to use in certain circumstances only  you see when you spout off with flame bait too many times sooner or later it catches up with you    
  andrew w korbut writes  anyway this game continued a trend that has sadly been taking shape for a couple of weeks now  i had hoped it was fatigue or an aberration but i cant snow myself any longer  alex mogilny must be benched as a disciplinary action and soon  his explanation for ysebaert jumping between him and lafontaine to score the winning goal yesterday  wasnt my guy ask patty about it  actually this stuff from mogilny doesnt surprise me all that much  about 0 or 0 weeks ago i read in the toronto sun a quote from alex it went something like sarcastically  yep pattys the man  hes responsible for the teams successim a  nobody around here  i was going to post it at the timei must have forgot since nobody else  was talking about him being a problem  if i heard that in the locker room id beat the shit out of him on the spot patty took responsibility in the press taking the heat off of alex  thats because lafontaine is the epitome of class and a consummate team player  yep id beat the shit out of him too  lafontaine really must be a team playermakes you wonder what the islander management was thinking my question is what the hell is muckler doing  whether he wishes to admit it or not the team is his to coach and if he cant do the job then maybe the job should be given to somebody who can    gee kinda like alexs spot on the team isnt it   drd the devils advocate            
  writes  im sorry to tell you this but unless they pull off another 0000 miracle there  is no way the habs will win this year   ever since they traded for ramage and since savard came off injury they have been playing shinny  and you cant blame roy for the 00 loss to washington when 00 players could not score one goal  i know you think i am a boston fan but all of my years have been dedicated to les habs  david degan  well it seems that the habs have been much talkedabout of late so heres my 000  these guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the damn net  watch them in the offensive zone especially on the powerplay  damphousse or lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone maybe pass to the point get it back skate some more pass it aroundbut wheres the shot answer the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands in front of the net a la neely shanahan tocchet etc etc  too bad  demers wont put dipietro or leclair on the powerplay more often  dammit even ewen would at least cause some disruptions  montreal desperately needs a power forward with some talent imo  then watch them in their own zone patrick roy is screened on everything say what you want about his performance imnsho he cannot stop what he cannot see  and montreals defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net  last night against washington roy played a great game  the first goal came on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble ive seen in a long time and he didnt have a hope in hell of stopping the shot  the second goal came on a deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway  pathetic defence  the third goal was en  no wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen   dchhabrastplistsca   
   wales conference adams division semifinal boston vs buffalo the bruins are playing some excellent hockey and with cam neely back and moog his old self again this should be a cakewalk  bruins in 0  im hoping for a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win the series  goaltending is about equal top offensive players are about equal mogilnylafontaine vs oatesjuneau but buffalo has no answer to neely not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player btw in fact hes one of my favourites even though hes a damn bruin    and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway  but i think it will go six  quebec vs montreal this one is very tough to call montreal certainly has the experience factor but quebec is more talented imho itll come down to the goalies  ill go with experience and roy canadiens in 0  agreed herebut montreal will be pushed to the limit  is it just me or does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy  go habs  final boston vs montreal will bruin domination continue in this rivalry yes moog has consistently outperformed roy in the playoffs after 0000other stuff  bruins in five  i cant predict a montreal victory because ive been watching them play for 0 weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players especially to play in the garden  last time they beat the bs 00 but boston had a clear territorial advantage the victory was roys  at the same time i cant bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so ill just say i will not be putting money on this series   patrick division semifinal  pittsburgh vs ny islanders what can i say the pens are flying high and have the most talent in the league   agreed  ny doesnt have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year  pens in five which is credit to ny  washington vs new jersey capitals in 0  agreed here too but i think it will go at least six  jersey has a decent team and washington has done poorly against the division this year  pittsburgh vs washington if the caps had bill ranford i might see an upset but don beaupre just doesnt inspire my hopes  penguins in 0  i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled  i dont think it will go six eithermaybe five  conference final pittsburgh vs boston a replay of last year the penguins are just as good as 00 months ago and the bruins are much improved but penguins in 0  if pittsburgh plays boston imo they win in likely five possibly six  they own the bruins  if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once again i wont be putting money on the seventh game  i say seven because the habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season  campbell conference norris division semifinal  chicago vs st louis or minnesota  blackhawks in 0  chicago will win but i think in at least six  chicago is not that good imo  and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties  detroit vs toronto the leafs have had an excellent season but theyve been playing playoff hockey all year  the habs under burns were the same way and always wilted in the playoffs  red wings in 0  very true  the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs  toronto might win two or three  at mlg though  wings in six maybe even seven  final chicago vs detroit  this will be a war fedorov will win it in ot red wings in 0  it will be a warpossibly the most intense playoff series of them all  and yes i think detroit will win  probert will have to come up big though  smythe division semifinals  vancouver vs winnipeg  canucks in 0  our first disagreement  canucks are playing like shit  they dont use their size at all which may explain why they get hammered 00 by a team chasing them calgarywinnipeg in six  calgary vs los angeles this would have been tough to call except for three things 0 the kings dont have a goalie 0 gary roberts will be back 0 the kings shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner paul coffey for a proven loser jimmy carson gretzky is just too weary to carry this group flames in 0  this is also tough for me to call because i havent seen the smythe enough  i dont think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a nonissue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate gretzky  la in six  final vancouver vs calgary  flames in 0  if it is these two calgary will not need six games  but i think it will be lawinnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice  coference final detroit vs calgary  red wings in 0  wow mustve been tough to go against your team  but lets see i picked ladetroit  detroit will win probably in six  stanley cup final pittsburgh vs detroit three in a row and official dynasty status for the pens or can the wings complete a dream season well the wings are better in goal not sufficiently so though imho and have better dmen however mario and the boys can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoffs though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him the pens are just too much especially since detroit will have a tougher battle to get here penguins in 0  if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i wouldnt bet against the wings  they are very strong imo and nobody knows how strong because theyve been underachieving most of the year  if forced to choose though id have to take the penguins  a side note  vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than gilmour  no way  he is a more talented pure goal scorerbut aside from the age difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team im not asking for flames either btwive spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say hes a great player  but while he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge gilmour does it all  i know a lot of gilmourbashing goes on esp from flame fans  but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill  he is easily one of the best allround players in the nhl    dchhabrastplistsca

      whats so bad about the new playoff format do you really believe teams that finish fourth in their div deserve to be in the playoffs  with the new format you have more of a chance to see more teams do you really want to see the bruins against the sabres umpteen times or would you rather see the bruins and the capitals in the secound round of playoffs  there is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just a little over a decade ago and noone showed up for the early rounds in the playoffswhereas soon after they went to the divisional setup arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds    the empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the bruins play the sabre umpteen times than see the bruins play the captials in the first round  maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case  the experiment is worthwhile with the uneven distribution of the expansion teams but i prefer the divisional  playoff  gerald  
   he was already offered 00 million for them from northlands coliseum but refused the offer i dont think he is going to sale i think he may decide to move the team to the states though where he can draw more revenue from the team   pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political office in northlands and in the business community that the oilers with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly basis they will likely have an operating loss based on normal hockey revenues and expenses  that he did this was a good thingit is better he complain early and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollarswhich would truly jeopardize the franchise  pocklingtons first option is not to sell or to move but to sell a minority share of the team to realize some of the appreciated value of the team and to get a better arena deal either in northlands or via a new building  pocklington probably isnt going to get exactly what he wantsbut ultimately he will probably get enough or will sell to someone who will probably get enough  there are a lot of risks in moving a team also  one has to remember peter pucks principleit is better to spend other peoples money than ones own if at all possible  gerald

     you might want to clarify the 00 game winning streak  that pens streak is a playoff streak tied by the chicago blackhawks who had won 00 in a row until they met the pens in the finals last year  the 00 game unbeaten so far is a regular season unbeaten streak  but hey dont take it personally  im a flyers fan and two in a row is a stretch  but with a healthy lindros recchi brindamour and tommy soderstrom theyll be there next year by the way since the flyers need defenseman what kind of trade would anybody suggest from the existing flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that  terry carkner wont be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook paper would be better defense  matt weaver properly found at ajs000psuvmpsuedu  hey at least were not                                                        the whalers  
  in article 0000apr0000000000000mprgatemprca tasallotgalaxymprca mathew tasalloti says chances this year but it seems to me like washington is the only team that can stop the penguins from winning their next stanley cup    really i think both the islanders and devils would have a better chance at the penguins than the capitals imo   robbie po           pgh penguins    it wont be easy but it contact for the 0000  00 stanley cup    will have greater rewards penn state lady lions    00 champions      mountains and valleys are rap000psuvmpsuedu     00 straight wins  better than nothing at all  really  what makes you think the islanders have a better shot  they couldnt even beat the whalers in two games  well since youre a pens fans the whole question is moot  i think the teams most likely to beat the pens are the bruins nordiques and blackhawks but i dont think they can really do it    tom galvin       galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil   
  the bottom line is the bruins are the better team this year montreal fans have been screaming for years that their beloved canadiens deserve another cup since the removal of the french canadien rule they have been screaming foul welcome to league parity something the rest of the league has had for years even if the habs do beat boston in the playoffs they wont get by the pens i do agree with you boston is the more taleneted team   the french canadian rule was an extremely short term feature when the universal draft was instituted in the sixties and only lasted for a few yearsand really didnt have any substantial effect during that period  the canadiens stanley cup achievements were earned on a level playing field  gerald

  robert angelo pleshar rp00andrewcmuedu writes  after watching the pengiuns all year and as many other teams as possible ive really noticed an increase in tom barassos cheap shots this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders  have a look at ed belfour  he also kicked john mclean of course he wasnt called for that   belfour kicked gerrard gallant when the wings played the hawks a couple of weeks ago no penalty no review no suspension this was after he attacked bob probert in the previous period he was penalized for that  theres no doubt in my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall hes also very good  likewise belfour too bad he goes down so much   ralph  brian down bdownvistorontoedu

  well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while chicago sweeps stlouis that just makes it easier in the second round with all the rest they will get and tordet getting none for the conf champ they will have a hard time versus the division but that div will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the hawks again then bring pitt and sure the hawks will probably lose but its better to get that far and lose than to not go  brian   
               what makes you think so  id like to understand your reasoning   from my seat the caps dont really appear to believe that they can    defeat pittsburgh  therefore they dont  i think their spirit was    broken in last years playoffs and hasnt really recovered  i dont know    what the season series numbers were but i believe that the pens won it   i think that either the devils or the islanders will cause more problems for      what is this spirit crap  im a caps fan and hope they win  if they end up facing pittsburgh  but i dont think the caps lose to pitt because of lack  of spirit  yes the penguins won the season series against the  caps  theyve won eighteen games in a row for gods sake  did you ever think the penguins might be good and thats  why they win  i reread what i wrote and it didnt say exactly what i thought    sure the pens are a better team  theyve got size and the best skill players in the league  theyve also got the best clutch goaltending  theyre the  best team in the league  but my point was the caps have not played to their ability level vs the pens since last years choke  and thats the mental problem the one theyve had for a number of years i tried to point out  spirit mental preparedness will to win whatever you want to call it its missing when the caps play the pens  actually youre right  it wont make any difference  george

   about 0 or 0 weeks ago i read in the toronto sun a quote from alex it  went something like sarcastically  yep pattys the man  hes responsible for the teams successim a   nobody around here  how can you assume it was a sarcastic remark for someone whose first language is not english i would interpret that comment to mean that he believes pat is the mvp on the team and that he is just one of the other normal players  quite modest i might say  well i dont recall assuming anything except perhaps that the columnist  who reported the incident was telling the truth ie the sarcastic impression came from him steve simmons  besides to my knowledge alex has a pretty fair grasp of the english languageand his recent comment after the detroit game would indicate that this remark is what i think it to be  very low   dchhabrastplistsca

    the oilers will charge to eat in the press room next year   there was an article in one of the toronto papers about this a few months agoprobably the globe and mail  any ethical journalist even a sports journalist should not accept free meals from a team in any case which was the one of the points the article was making  admittdly most sports reporting is mostly with any ethical standards  gerald  
   it is meaningless to compare one players plusminus statistic with  another players out of the context of the role and the playing time  of the players involved      its just as meaningless to compare goals assists pim and any other stat i can think of  each player is asked to take a unique role for his team  the contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the same team or different teams  and yet  awards are given and promotions received based in part on these meaningless stats  the operative words are in part  stats must be interpreted tempered with other information one has about the player      to compare jagrs and franciss plusminus is ridiculous and absurd  and comparing jagrs and franciss points is just as ridiculous and absurd but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals assists points  for selanne lindros juneau potvin and the other rookies in the league and yet  how about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game  ron

the puck at the flyers blue line and nylander stripped him and took off  the recchi goal was a 0 on 0 with lindros  the bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie  on the second nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in this is the most frustrating part of the flyers defense take the body and if they get one shot and beat you fine dont give them another chance carkner galley and mcgill are all terrible about this ill bet money at least one of them was the closest flyer to the play  thats all i have my radio got bad after that and i was lucky to know who it was that scored much less how  from what i heard roussel had a very strong game after the game gene hart asked bobby taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game it was garry galley 0 for his career high point total im surprised that a former goalie wouldnt look closer at his defensive play tommy  soderstrom 0 for his team record tying 0 shutouts in only about 00 a season and mark recchi 0 for his all time high team single season scoring mark but heres the odd part he couldnt decide between lindros and recchi for number 0 if he picks recchi as 0 after he had a hard time choosing between him and lindros doesnt that make lindros 0  what you wanna know my three stars of the season well since you asked  0 eric lindros eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice the difference between the teams record with him and without him is no accident i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without recchi there is no question that this team is significantly better with eric lindros on it and i think that he will deservedly wear the c on his jersey next season  0 tommy soderstrom 0 shutouts was second in the league to only ed belfour and tommy didnt have a chris chelios booo in front of him he also didnt play a complete season due to heart problems sentimental edge here my family has a history of heart problems theres no question in my mind that tommy soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future and if roussel complains again about being number 0 look for him to be traded within 0 years  0 mark recchi again you cant argue with an alltime team high single season scoring mark there are an awful lot of teams that didnt have a single player get as many points plus mark is the only flyer to play the entire season not a tough choice  honorable mentions rod brindamour topped his single season high point total which he set last year the difference was that he wasnt on the top line this year and didnt get as much playing time then again he didnt get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either  dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman yes he made rookie mistakes but he was usually fast enough to make up for them i have a feeling that with his shot hell score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone and i suspect that hell be the teams top defenseman in years to come  garry galley was the teams point leader from defensemen again there are some things you just cant argue with and he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his wishes under doctors orders but his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution a little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year  brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total but consistency became a problem for him  a couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members  tom misnik a member of the mailing list would like to exchange email

  all these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at njd they are a very deep team with two very capable goalies and excellent forwards and defensemen  shooter in richer an all around do it all in todd chef stasnymaster of a thousand dishes power play captainstevens  take a look at the numbers or play with them and see for yourselves    yup i agree with ya i think devils can beat red wings easily so i think   all those who send in their votes should try all these diffrent teams   before voting i think islanders and quebec are much better then i had   expected    cobra                                                                             sex is not the answer sex is the                      question yes is the answer                                                                                      email cobrachopinudeledu                                                                                                                         
   jutila was a failure i think while makela and ari haanpaa had an onagainoffagain career with the islanders both players had to play in the minors of course i like our players i just dont think the names you mention could cut it as stars in the nhl even rexi in his prime was more of a good regular in new yorkedmonton than a superstar in his own right although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf   ruotsaleinen was a more than competent nhlerhis choice of where to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability  he was crucial to the oilers stanley cup victory in 0000 the one without gretzky because he made an oiler power play which was lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive  the oilers missed him more the following year than kurri and i think the oilers would have make the finals if ruotsaleinen has stayed around the following season and would have beaten pittsburgh with ruotsaleinen and a healthy messierand delayed pittsburghs dynasty by a season    gerald  
    could someone post the flyers record with and without eric lindros in the lineup   i have a guy that is trying to compare the quebecflyers trade to the   dallasminnesota trade in the nflhershel walker  i just need the stat to back up my point that eric will be one of the next  great players  thanks  john  
  i recently bought a pack of prospect hockey cards which had various players that were coming into the nhl i got this particular card of a russian named viktor kozlov it says many scouts believe he will be the 0 pick in 0000 another guy is quoted as saying hes as  good as mario lemieux anyone know who this guy is   via dlg pro v0000

  un you better add at least another plus to the pederson for neely trade the bruins also received a number 0 round draft pick didnt play great this year but wesleys still a decent defenseman  and the bruins got pederson back eventually anyway               pat ellis   ps  go bruins    go umaine black bears    0000       number 0                     hockey east regulars season champions                    hockey east tournament champions                    paul kariya hobey baker award winner          ncaa div 0 hockey tournament champions                       maine      ggggooooooo    bbbllluueeee  
   well i just read in the boston globe that while not confirming or denying anything walsh may end up with the rangers organizations as an assistant coach  keenan has talked with walsh in the past he came up to see kariya as he will be coaching him in the worlds funny i guess he got to watch the ferraro brothers as well im not sure if walsh will go but if keenan is getting 000000 and walsh even gets 000000 thats a 00 pay raise for walsh not to mention a nice career move anyone from new york hear anything about this                 pat ellis     ps  go bruins    go umaine black bears    0000       number 0                     hockey east regulars season champions                    hockey east tournament champions                    paul kariya hobey baker award winner          ncaa div 0 hockey tournament champions                       maine      ggggooooooo    bbbllluueeee  
  in 0000apr000000000000hubcapclemsonedu jwodziadliteuucp john wodziak writes  sorry roger but mr basketbal should what he really means here ie he should have said that he hopes fans in the american southeast can follow the names of the divisions the odds that these people other than those who are displaced notherners who are probably already fans is on the order of the proverbial snowballs in hell  i am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here   if  you asked  somone  who  had never heard of hockey before if la played in the smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be what  if you asked this person if la played in the west division  the naming of  divisions  after  longdead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary obfuscation  i am glad that the names are being changed for another reason  the names patrick smythe norris adams and campbell are all the names of socalled builders of the game  this is the same type of thinking that put stein in the hall of fame  this is absolute nonsense  the real builders of the game are richard morenz howe conacher orr etc  if you are going to name the divisions after people at least name the divisions after people who deserve it  yes these people deserve recognigtion as hockey greats but the old division names took into account messers patrick norris smythe and the prince who  had alot more to do with the origins of the league than people who came into an already established situation it is much easier to be an element of change  hardly  the established situation existed prior to smythe  et  al the  stanley  cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge  what our  dear  founders  did was formalize the challenge  they created a closed league an oligop olistic professional system in the interests of making money  wheth er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable  we are however stuck with their invention and  that  de bate  is  academic   the  point  to  be made however is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  smythe and his pals showed up  or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates a new situation  if you want to honor players like bobby orr than im sure you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive  defenseman  whats wrong with best defenceman period  was there  ever  a  better defenceman   was  there  ever a better player  and if you think that bruce norris contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  bobby orrs  then  in the interests of education why dont you take a poll and find out how many people know who norris was  but you dont  have to do you  no i cant for the reasons i gave above im in the same boat as jason and i grew up with the current divisonal names and learned them when i was about  00 years old and who played in what division if a 00 year old american can learn this why would it be hard for an occasional fan to pick up  on who plays in what division  so you dont feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember that  vancouver  plays in the west division  or pacific or whatever other intuitively understandable moniker is chosen  oh  now i see your point  your intention has been to alert us to the erosion of purity  ill bet you like hockey because its for the most part played by whites of european extraction   probably not in my case im sure of this what you said would be like me saying that all maple leafs fans are as biased closed minded ignorant  and of course you neatly deleted jasons  jingoistic  rant  about  the game  losing  its  canadianization   quoting me out of context does more to erode your credibility than it  does  mine   my  position  is clearly  progressive  and  is anything but biased closed minded ig norant  arrogant i will grant you  arrogant and moronic as you  just because someone a doesnt like what mr basketball is doing b voices their opinion and c likes the senerio of you going to antartica does not mean that you have the right to insult them  nice try john  but for a flame to be truly effective you have to display  at  least  enough  intelligence  to  earn  your targets respect  cordially as always  rm     roger maynard  maynardramseycslaurentianca

  does anyone out there have the shorthanded goal totals of the nhl players for this season  were trying to finish our rotisserie stats and need shg to make it complete   
   stanley cup finals toronto maple leafs    vs    montreal canadiens     the classic stanley cup final matchup also a dream come true montreal wins the stanley cup in the 0th game 0  0 in double overtime  you know after i finished laughing i thought  this would be a great final  two canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that don cherry nonsense behind them and a nailbiter finish  of course i would prefer a vancouvermontreal final with vancouver scoring the final goal  pity neither will happen  steve holland     
  a fine 00 year history came to a close tonight as the minnesota north stars  or norms stars whichever you prefer lost to the red wings by a score of 00  the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen who netted two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to play   yes its a shame that the nhl lost a fine team in one of the best hockey markets in the country  being a north stars fan it is sad to see all of the tradition of the last 00 years get thrown into oblivion at the hands of a truly crappy owner  hopefully the nhl will install an expansion franchise in the twin cities within the next five years  even if this is the case a lot has been lost in the north stars move  kea  
  nluxenonstanfordedu nelson lu writes  centers mark messier n y rangers  messier was not invited due to his nagging injuries  while the press made an issue of it and attempted to link it to the rangers internal political woes mike keenan repeated that to messier personally during the msg press conference  it makes sense  messier would probably have not declined the invitation if it were made for publicity   gld   je me souviens  gary l dare  gldcolumbiaedu go  winnipeg jets  go  gldcunixcbitnetselanne  domi  stanley  
  the subject line says it all  is it terribly difficult to get tickets to penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  would it be easy to find scalpers outside of the igloo selling tickets  dean money dmoneymagnusacsohiostateedu

   the subject line says it all  is it terribly difficult to get tickets  to penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  would  it be easy to find scalpers outside of the igloo selling tickets    dean money  dmoneymagnusacsohiostateedu       here is my traditional experience with tickets playoffs and otherwise at the civic arena       scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the arena  best  strategy given that you dont mind missing the anthem which is ok if be taylor decides to come back ever again   is to wait until 000 or 000 when the game is rolling the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets       playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on  whats left at 000 may be nosebleed material d e sections  others can add on their opinions as well  kevin l stamber purdue university penguins 0 devils 0  pens lead series 0 game to none

000 of the second nelson emerson broke in on the left side got by craig muni and pushed the puck across the slot belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards where brown collected it and slapped it in before belfour could get back to the goal  two minutes later on a hawks power play belfour stopped rich sutter on a shorthanded breakin chris chelios picked up the puck and passed it to jeremy roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open noonan with a nice pass across the slot noonan fired it past joseph at 000 for the 00 lead  noonan completed his hat trick 000 later to increase the hawks lead to 00 stephane matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to noonan who beat stephane quintal by driving to the net joseph had no chance as noonan

leading 00 at 000 of the third stephane matteau picked up a high sticking penalty just 00 seconds into the power play steve smith was called for slashing giving the blues a 0on0 advantage for 000  the

  the subject line says it all  is it terribly difficult to get tickets to penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  would it be easy to find scalpers outside of the igloo selling tickets  there are always scalpers with tickets outside the arena  you might have to pay a few bucks extra but you can always find them  look on the street under the message board or out on the street in front of the hyatt or even around gate 0  the later you buy them the less money youll pay and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face value or below if you wait until game time  might be better to pick them up earlier now though  rick

  well put jason  i am not from wisconsin but i have close relatives who live in port washington about 00 minutes north of milwaukee i visit the city regularly and i have been in the bradley four times to see the admirals play  and the ncaa hockey championships  it is a beautiful building  the pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in north america as to what will happen with the admirals if milwaukee does acquire a franchise word is the team will move to green bay and play in the brown county arena once again the admirals are an independent franchise and the people of milwaukee have been supporting them well  the games i have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 00000 to 00000 which are numbers some nhl teams ie the islanders hartford new jersey would be envious of having on some nights plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without the glamour of having an nhl club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount of hockey interest exists in the city  sincerely  martin hill rt 0 box 000b sault ste marie mi home of lssu  go lakers  ps  anybody know what the attendance figures are for the ihl and how milwaukee stacks up against other ihl cities such as atlanta phoenix san diego cleveland and cincinnati  if so please reply

   a fine 00 year history came to a close tonight as the minnesota north stars  or norms stars whichever you prefer lost to the red wings by a score of 00  the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen who netted two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to play  are there any further stories to report on the eve of norms farewell  from the twin cities in an earlier post it was announced that norm  green was given until midnight of the last homegame of the north stars to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena  did this happen was norm runoutoftown  rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board  the scoreboard fell to the ice and flattened mr greedy to a large piece of green paper arena management had to use the zamboni which  they confiscated from norms truck to cleanup the useless remains    mike

    i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they face them in the finals which is what all the detroit sportswriters  are predicting  although i think bryan murray is probably the best gm i have ever seen in hockey  how do you figure that  when bryan murray took over the wings they were a pretty good team that was contending for the stanley cup but looked unlikely to win it  now they are a pretty good team that is contending for the stanley cup but looks unlikely to win it  a truly great gm would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the nhl and maybe win the stanley cup  a good gm like murray can maintain the teams success but cant push them to the next level  in the history of hockey there have been several better gms than murray way too many to name  murray isnt even the best gm in the league today he fails in comparison to sinden sather savard caron fletcher and quinn in my estimation  i cant imagine how bryan murray can be the best gm anyone has ever seen in hockey unless they have seen very few gms  gregmeister

    certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team  and that is simply because there are not enough solid twoway players to go  around  who would you rather have as your checking centre  doug gilmour or doug jarvis  for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres  do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey   gretzky lemieux gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman they play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one  if they were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive abilities   when you compare gretzky et al to jarvis gainey etc you are comparing  apples and oranges  it is like me telling you that felix potvin isnt  very good because a team would be better if the had lemieux instead of him  sure lemieux is a better player but he is a different type of player  for a team to be successful they need to have all types of players this includes defensive forwards  when compared with other defensive forwards bob gainey is the greatest defensive forward ever  he is the player whos talents best suited being a defensive forward who completely dominated the game when he played  maybe if a more talented player such as gretzky had decided to waste his offensive talents and play defensively he could have been a better defensive forward but he wasnt  bob gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey  gregmeister

given a major   perhaps it was trottier  it happened behind the habs goal if i recall gainey simply didnt have his head up as he was picking up the puck   but roger what the hell does this have to do with gaineys skill as a hockey player  if probert smashes gilmours head into the boards next week will that diminish your assessment of gilmours skills   if gilmour was taken completely by surprise as gainey was then yeah i would have to say that doug wasnt playing technically smart  hockey  in any case to claim as greg did that gainey never made  a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous   later on in your posting you make reference to putting words into other peoples mouthsi would suggest that your last paragraph can only be interpreted in one waynamely that i along with greg claim that gainey never made a technical mistake  if you actually read what ive written you will find that i make no such claimsoooo if logic serves me well youre contradicting yourself   gainey was a plugger  and when the press runs out of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers  grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duffand so on   i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter   good for you  youd only be displaying your ignorance of course but to each his own   roger im not sure here but i think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinionbut hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all means go aheadthats if it makes you feel better   i think gainey would be honoured to know that youve included him   i think gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at  all     my word such vehemence against poor ol bob gainey  why does he bother you so muchhe was an effective player for his style of play   on this list  i also think you have a relatively naive view about what wins a hockey gamepluggers are an integral part of   certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team  and that is simply because there are not enough solid twoway players to go  around  who would you rather have as your checking centre  doug gilmour or doug jarvis  for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres  do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey    im really sorry roger but you have lost me completely here  why dont you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ himself in nets   now if you were to compare say for example bob gainey with guy carbonneau you would have a balanced comparison   any team  the selke is designed to acknowledge their contributioni think that most people understand that its not the nobel prizeso settle down   youre wrong again  the selke is awarded to the forward that does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger  if  gilmour does the best defensive job in the league i dont see why he  should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offensively   im wrong againhmmm lets seewhere was i wrong in the first place  im only guessing here rog but i have a feeling that youve setup a youre wrong again macro key on your machine   i agree that my use of the word plugger is simplisticbut i think you know what im getting at  i would also like to point out that gilmours potential as a selkewinner was never part of the debateare you asking me for an opinion  if so i think there are far too many other deserving players to include gilmour among the candidates   settle down  if you think that i have likened the selke to the nobel prize then i suggest that you had best settle down  and if you are going to try to put words in my mouth let me suggest that you settle  down before you bother following up on my postings    i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers  grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duffand so on demonstrates a blanket

fri 00 apr 0000 000000 gmt   discussion deleted   good for you  youd only be displaying your ignorance of course but to each his own   roger im not sure here but i think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinionbut hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all means go aheadthats if it makes you feel better   to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious  your hockey education is not my responsibility   my hockey education  what the f are you talking about  im not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement    my word such vehemence against poor ol bob gainey  why does he bother you so muchhe was an effective player for his style of play   he was just another player  to laud him as anything more i find bothersome  i hated the habs  i hated lafleur until i realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever  skate in my lifetime  why would anyone talk about gainey   i hate the habs you sound like a 00year old  this statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to argue objectively about hockey  dont give me this crap about cogent argumentsive yet to read something of yours that is cogent  you consistently argue with 0 emotion 0 huge sweeping statements   frankly you have a very unconvincing style   im not defending bob gaineyfrankly i dont care for him all that much  but your dismissal of him as something less than an effective hockey player is tiresomeit has no basis in anything  how many calders did he win i think it was four go ahead and refresh my memory  what about the conn smythe  was that a fluke  yeah not the makings of a hockey superstar i know but try to have a reason any reason to shoot him down   go  around  who would you rather have as your checking centre  doug gilmour or doug jarvis  for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres  do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey   im really sorry roger but you have lost me completely here  why dont you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ himself in nets   did he play hockey at a high level  was he any good  if not why would you bother to bring jc up  i am talking about hockey players here  if you cant follow the conversation dont follow up  as i said previously it is not my responsibility to educate you   hey cowboy  youre the expert who introduced the idiotic comparison of gainey with gretzky and lemieuxyou figure it out   now if you were to compare say for example bob gainey with guy carbonneau you would have a balanced comparison   sure  two journeymen  big deal  neither one of them is worth discussing   how many individual awards between them eighti dont remember once again please feel free to refresh my memoryand try to be as sarcastic as possible about my hockey education   im wrong againhmmm lets seewhere was i wrong in the   i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter   oh my god  did i say that  rogerwhats your point  fuhr is a goaltender goaltenders dont plugin his prime he was one of the best  sanderson was a scrapperif you stick him on you may as well include half the flyers team of the same era   first place  im only guessing here rog but i have a feeling that youve setup a youre wrong again macro key on your machine   that is an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time responding to any of your or gregs postings then i will be sure to implement that very macro   oh roger you shouldntreally  i dont deserve thisyou are far too accomodating already   i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers  grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duffand so on demonstrates a blanket disregard for these individuals as contributors to the gameso yes settle downnobody has claimed that they are hockey gods   tarasov claimed that gainey was a hockey god  and greg ate it up and that is what this thread is all about  if you didnt know  that then why are you responding   you seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into your sweeping vacuous statementthats why  if you want to debate gainey go aheadbut why bring up everybody else  how does it support your argument  do you have an argument or do you just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us     and as for blanket disregard for these individuals i can remember  leaf teams purely populated by such individuals winning four stanley cups  teams  no one ran around telling us that george armstrong was the best hockey player in the world   great  i couldnt agree more  the flyers won two cups for the same reasonsdeservedly so  so what  i dont get it  are you angry that the leafs didnt get more recognition     you seem to think these pluggers are hypedi dont agreeplain and simple  if youre last statement is some sort of compromise fair enough   you might consider developing your own style  after all imitation is  the sincerest form of flattery and i am quite sure that flattery is not  your intention   cmonit has a nice ring to itand admit it you had a good laugh   right  i had to get to the end of your posting before i realized you were  a complete joke   not a pleasant bone in your body eh rog  why are you so unhappy  not getting invited to enough parties  what   in the future if you are going to respond to my postings i would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize   roger why are you under the impression that responding to your posts is some great honour  you really should stopit sounds a little bit pathetic  frankly its about as honourable as a good fart   congenially as always    jd     james david

  as the sharks season came to a close tonight i will start a series of posts trying to revisit the players the trades the moves etc that went through for the sharks for the past season  if you are uninterested since i will have the words sharks review in the subject heading in these postings you can kill them  i will first try to evaluate how the players did  these ratings of course are subject to my own biases but i hope that i can try to be as objective as possible  i will evalute players who finished the season with the sharks andor did not play for another nhl team this season  thus then lets go to the goaltenders  0brian haywardseason00th acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradep d  it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end a career that featured sharing three jennings trophies with patrick roy in 00 00 and 00  it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade and skip the letter grading but he had simply been awful on ice this year save for a bright spot or two and even if he had been healthy he would not be any more than the 0rdstring goalie  but hayward was a classy individual who also figured in on the sharks first ever victory the 0rd game of the season last year against the calgary flames as he retires the fans will remember what a good guy he was  00jeff hackettseason 0rd acquired0000 from n y islanders in expansion draft gradec  hackett after deservedly winning the team mvp honors last season simply wasted the year  other than a few good spots 00 saves against los angeles almostshutout against tampa bay etc hackett finishing with 000 save percentage and a 000 gaa watched his status go from the teams 0 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season  he was expected early to carry the team along instead he apparently became frustrated but the an early injury that forced him to miss 00 games may have been a contributing factor but upon return he simply wasnt up to the task  he may not return next year  00wade flahertyseason 0st still eligible as rookie acquired0000 signed as undrafted free agent gradei a  it is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone thus the incomplete grade but yet in the one start that he did get against the calgary flames flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods  he started the season poorly in kansas city but finished strong prompting the blades owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp honors  the upcoming ihl playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the nhl last year he was a capable backup for arturs irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoffs picking up allstar honors along with irbe now its time for him to show that he can share the job with irbe next year because with prospects dan ryder trevor robins and scott cashman coming along if he doesnt make it next year he may not ever  00arturs irbeseason0st acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradeb  i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly established that hes a bona fide nhl goaltender perhaps a bona fide 0 goaltender  he has provided most of the little highlight footage that the sharks team had getting the teams first ever shutout against the los angeles kings on december 00 he has been fearless in and out of the net aggressively playing the puck and making passes reminding people of a young ron hextall except of course the goonism  yet he still needs to develop more consistency which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him but if the sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season irbes the key as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 00 times in 00 starts   go calgary flames  al macinnis for norris  gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in edmonton  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu recsporthockey contact for the san jose sharks

markus naslund made a drop pass at the finnish  blue line popovic picked it up and advanced towards the finnish goal and  shot a nice hard wrist shot in ketterers top corner ville sirens slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 00 and juha riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over aslin 00 after the first period  the finns started the second period with really good pressure korpisalo  made it 00 with another goal from close range high over aslin then  during the finnish pressure sweden turned the game around in 000  mikael renberg worked hard behind the finnish goal and passed the puck to  jan larsson in front who backhanded the puck low 00 rundqvist entered  the finnish zone and passed to ahlund and the finnish defense let ahlund   skate in and take a shot that ketterer dropped into the goal 00  next roger hansson behind the goal sent the puck back to the blue line  where roger akerstrom took a slap shot and ketterer didnt see the puck since  there was traffic in front 00  third period started with a nice goal by stefan the shadow nilsson stefan  and patrik juhlin entered the finnish zone patrik passed the puck back to  stefan who alone with ketterer made no mistake 00  then keijo sailynoja show started he reduce and equalized the lead in only  00 seconds first he scored the 00 goal and after that he came in alone   with aslin but was tripped by aslin to get a penalty shot sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot  the swedes seemed to head for a win when mikael renberg scored the 00 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination renberg waited in the slot  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side ahlund passed the puck  and renberg took a turnaround shot low in ketterers goals far side  but jari korpisalo had other plans as he only 00 seconds later scored the  games final goal to make it 00 korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that maybe aslin should have saved   all in all a decent game where the defense wasnt the best  both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations   renberg and rundqvist plays well together in the swedish team larsson  nilssonjuhlin best line overall again it seems to be a working wc line  stillman good on defense  some players

  in tervio00katkhelsinkifi terviokatkhelsinkifi writes      now what if the two teams were merged this has been proposed in tampere   with ilves  lynx and tappara  axe  the fans wouldnt take it   they rather see their teams out of the playoffs most of the time or even   relegated than merged  its not that difficult to understand its just   like here in helsinki  you grow up being either a jokerit or hifk fan  the other team is the last team in the world you would support  im not   talking about hate but about extremely deeply rooted rivalry  deeply rooted rivalry ahem jokerit have been around since 0000 and joined the top flight only in the early 00s helsingfors ifk have been around since 0000 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 0000s so i think youre exagerating here      however its been proved that both fan groups can cheer the same team   thats the finnish national team  maybe thats how you could set up a   huge franchise in finland  no one has ever said that the team must be   called after one city or play all its games on one arena  just one team   finland and team sweden in the nhl just wouldnt make any sense  we have   way more talent than 000th of the total of north american talent  after a   couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the   nordic  presuming that our teams would have the advantage in  drafting   local talent as prooposed  thats a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the canadian  american olympic teams have been    and theyve had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice the 0000 olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team canada had eric lindros sean burke joe juneau and chris kontos another four or five have been deep subs in the nhl as for the yanks keith tkachuk scott lachance bret hedican shawn  mceachern steve heintze ted donato joe sacco and bill guerin have been  0rd0th line players in the nhl while robb stauber has done well for the  kings in goal nothing more in fact im sure that an allstar team assembled from the best finnish league teams would do no better in the nhl than hartford  or tampa bay currently are doing  but what happens if all topclass finnish  swedish players gradually end up with helsinki  stockholm as the north americanbased ones gradually retire and no canadianamerican team is allowed to draft new players from scandinavia  here is what the hockey news scouts think of our nhlbased players  0000superstar 0000star 0000nhl regular 0000nhl regular  000role player  finland

los angeles jari kurri and new yorks tikkanen are right up there with any fiveman unit pittsburgh  co have but i have my doubts about the homebased finnish players  the national team did well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of markus ketterer the goalie 00 or the players listed above and luck theres presumably a lot of decent players in finland that wouldnt be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players however my guess would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a 000 team in the nhl  sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in north america their points total 00 players is 000  seven more than ottawas 00 top players combined if we estimate there are six more nhl regulars back home in  sweden an allswedish team would assemble about 000000 skill points deducting some points from pittsburgh ny rangers and other teams that rely on swedish players the swedish team would finish in sixth place  about as high as boston vancouver calgary and montreal on paper so the dynasty talk isnt completely unfounded here an allfinnishallswedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time wont have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably play the wideopen european variant of hockey rather than have to learn the north american checking game however if free agency becomes a factor the top  scandinavian players still might end up playing for largemarket teams after a  couple of years the same way edmontons dynasty crumbled in the late 00s  some fringe players likely will be drafted by other nhl teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all id settle for a  compromise prohibit all european teams from signing a north american during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players after this  the amateur draft should be open to anyone       j o o   j o o   j o k e r i t          finland

   i saw yesterday on tv a game between team sweden and team finland most of us might know that it was played in stockholm and the result was 00 for the home team thats nothing very special but i was very surprised of saku koivu i must admit that he surprised me  already in the finnish playoffs and now on team finland  saku koivu is a light weight player if we consider his size according to my stats he is only 000cm and 00kgs and he is only 00 000000 but he is a real twoway player skates well can score gives nice passes does even bodycheckings he is really something to watch in the wc   the size isnt always everything maybe we remember harlamov and they say that saku is still growing up 0cm during last year  saku isnt that small any longer i guess i heard he is 000cm tall at the moment and will still grow 00cm  petteri kortelainen   
   in c0h0wr0j0polarisutufi frantipolarisutufi writes   not too low perhaps but surely not as high as that of an european nhl division the finnish team for example would contain all players currently   on the national team plus a topclass foreigner or two they would be in an entirely different league than tps or jokerit both of whom have perhaps a dozen players of international class  if even that why settle for a minor league when you could have the best  how many players of international class an average nhl team has 000 top players just play more in smaller rinks is the quality of european hockey really poor then recent years only few northamerican usually good farm  players players have got place in finnish league or elitserien while most  have been shipped back   petteri kortelainen  
   greaniastexasmitreorg steve greanias writes        i do not have cable and on the nights the caps dont play i  would like to tune in other games  does anyone have a list of  the radio stations which broadcast the games for the nhl teams      thanks in advance    i can give you a couple  in detroit wjr 000 will be broadcasting  at least the first couple of games of the wingstoronto series and   since they broadcast at 00000 watts you may be able to pick it up  after dark where you are at  the pittsburgh penguins games used to be  broadcast on kdka 0000 but i dont know whether they will be preempted  by baseball and moved to another station or not  you can try those  if the local baseball teams arent playing at the same time anyway    randy    kdka has first rights to pirates games and will split probably 0000 in conflicts for penguins games which are preempted check out  0000 wdve fm thats right dve  it is also 00000 watts  kevin l stamber purdue university no funny sig today   
  the new name is florida panthers   the panther is an endangered species mostly located in the everglades a couple of years ago there were license plates made with panthers on them part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund  the name of the new president of the panthers should be announced today  as of yesterdays paper huizengas new hockey team will take the ice at the miami arena this fall  the team has a guaranteed twoyear lease with the arena with four oneyear options that could run through 0000  its not our choice james blosser a lawyer and huizenga aid said about ruling out the arena as a long term option  the nhl told us we  cant stay there  its not economically feasible  one reason is because the miami heat basketball team controls skybox and advertising revenue at the arena reducing the hockey teams profit potential  the hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from broward dade  and palm beach counties  a leading site is vacant land near joe robbie stadium where residents 00 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena ending an eightyear battle of wills  compliments of the newssunsentinel  jim g  fitzsanchezcastranova  
  as i promised i would give you the name of the panthers president after huizenga announced the team name he announced that bill torrey is named the first president of the panthers  a little bio from sunsentinel torrey the architect of four consecutive stanley cup champions as  persident and general manager of the new york islanders throughout his 00 years in the nhl bill torreys bow ties have become as much of a signature as andre agassis hair  the panthers will introduce a uniform insignia and ticketprice  information in early next month  in the meantime huizenga leaves the daytoday operation in the hands of torrey and bob clarke the vp and gm  the florida panthers was chosen as the name of south floridas nhl team to focus attention on an endangered species  there are 00 to 00 florida panthers in the everglades national park the big cypress national  preserve and other parts of southwestern florida  the panther is the quickeststriking of all cats torrey said   hopefully thats the way well play on ice  more bio in torrey huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion islanders in 0000 and the one most responsible for guiding the islanders to four consecutive stanley cup championships their first after only eight seasons and 00 consecutive winning seasons  as executive vice president of the california golden seals torrey watched the seals go to the play offs in 0000 only their second nhl season  i guess this completes my own personal hat trick said torrey 00 a native of montreal but a resident of bear lakes country club in palm beach  jim g other accounts goryckisolcsefauedu jimgcybernetcsefauedu   i repeat myself when under stress i repeat myself when under stress i repeat myself when under stress i repeat myself when under stress i repeat  adrian belew indicipline    
  greaniastexasmitreorg steve greanias writes  i can give you a couple  in detroit wjr 000 will be broadcasting at least the first couple of games of the wingstoronto series and  since they broadcast at 00000 watts you may be able to pick it up after dark where you are at  the pittsburgh penguins games used to be broadcast on kdka 0000 but i dont know whether they will be preempted by baseball and moved to another station or not  you can try those if the local baseball teams arent playing at the same time anyway  according to this mornings postgazette  the pens will be carried by kdkaradio0000 am unless the pirates are playing  when the pirates play the games will be carried by  wdve0000 fm  wdve will carry 00 games starting with tonights game  in fact after this season kdka will no longer be the flagship station for the pens  the penguins and kbl have struck a new  deal regarding the tv and radio rights to the games  it seems more than likely that wdve will be the flagship radio station next  season  kbl will carry 00 games on tv  with 00 of the games to be  simulcast on kdkatv  the remaining 00 games as well as some of the  early round playoff games will be available by subscription tv only to receive the games youll have to pay a one time hook up fee and then a monthly fee of 0000 dollars  also under the new deal there will no longer be radiotv  simulcasts  there will be a tv broadcast team and a radio broadcast team    no word on who the announcers will be  mike lange and paul steigerwald are both under contract with kdka but their contracts expire at the end of this season  kbl president bill craig said hed like to hire lange and steigerwald  lori contact for the penguins llicscmuedu    
  so whats the deal with bill wirtz apparently the blackhawks  st louis game was a standing room only sell out as usual but the hawks reported the attendace as 00000 gee i wonder if wirtz is planning to use this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of tv what a schmuck  in other tv news the penguins announced yesterday that they will have 0 fewer broadcast tv games and will have 00 games on some sort of subscription  payperview system yuck  ralph

      it was nice to see espn show game 0 between the wings and leafs since  the cubs and astros got rained out instead of showing another baseball  game they decided on the stanley cup playoffs a classy move by espn  what did you leave the room each of the 000 or so times they said that there were no other night baseball games every break they took back at the studio mentioned it followed by sowere gonna show you hockey instead my wife and i are hoping for rain at every baseball game they have a feed for tommorrow night  point is be glad they showed hockey but if baseball was available anywhere else you can bet you wouldve watched baseball last night  pete clark  
  detroit april 00  in a development that shocked most knowledgable observers the detroit redwings scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en route to a 00 win over the best team in the nhl the toronto maple leafs   the leafs could not be faulted as they completely dominated the inferior detroit squad and clearly deserved to win only the biased officiating of andy van hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior  visiting side prevented an allout massacre of the wings by the leagues best  team              alan  ps this is sweet roger so sweet i look forward to the next installment on wednesday night i trust you do too   
   according to the fan here in to ottawa has won the daigle e  sweepstakes  they didnt mention why but san jose had more goals  than the sensens so i have a hunch this is why ottawa would pick  first  if im not mistaken san jose had more wins than ottawa first tiebreaker in the nhl is always most wins  alan

  in 0000apr0000000000000newshubistsca dchhabrastplistsca deepak chhabra writes  however that aside the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it making it easier for the casual fan or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour  imo the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports  in addition i do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey so its a pointless exercise anyway  there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans  i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages  and of course they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time   another thing that bothers me is the points system  percentages as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative  when i look at the nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand which is almost always the case  some will object to percentages claiming perhaps that it is an americanization of the sport but i feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is american or not is irrelevant   if the current names are inappropriate then that is a separate issue not  central to the original article  something to consider additionally is whether or not players like orr who contributed to the glory of the sport would have been able to do so without an organized professional league to play in  in this case honouring builders of the league as opposed to builders of the sport becomes a chickenandegg type question although it was the chicken  even if orr couldnt have contributed without the likes of norris you would have to agree that norris couldnt have contributed without the likes of orr and taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made the more meaningful contribution  exactly true  naming divisions and trophies after smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put stein in the hall of fame  i have always thought that this was nonsense  dunno if the stein comparison is justifiable since it doesnt look as though his unanimous acceptance to the hall will hold up  it doesnt look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it      cordially as always                      maynardramseycslaurentianca                                             so many morons rm                                                   and so little time

   and now i interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you  another message sponsored by the department of really mundane statistics  i passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through a filter to average out games goals assists points and penalty minutes for the mythical average nhl pro who played in the league this season why because its monday and i didnt feel like writing any real code  anyway after i wiped out the 00odd goalies in the list i came up with  nhl average00 gp      00 g      00 a      00 pts      00 pim  then i passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories  marty mcinnis nyi00 gp 0 00 g 0 00 a 0 00 pts 0 00 pim 00 igor kravchuk edm00 gp 0 00 g 0 00 a 00 00 pts 0 00 pim 00  these two are close in games goals assists and points but are too far off in pim this leaves as the most average player in the nhl  bobby carpenter was00 gp 00 00 g 0 00 a 00 00 pts 0 00 pim 0  what an honor  i also passed the list through with the goalies still included kravchuk and carpenter were still in the top three but rob dimaio came flying up from  behind to take the title  nhl average00 gp      00 g      00 a      00 pts      00 pim igor kravchuk edm     00 gp 0 00 g 0 00 a 0 00 pts 0 00 pim 00 bobby carpenter was   00 gp 00 00 g 00 00 a 0 00 pts 0 00 pim 0 rob dimaio tb00 gp 0 0 g 0 00 a 00 00 pts 00 00 pim 0   its all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it  sg      and now back to our regularly scheduled programming  
     charlie betz cbetzromuluscraycom writes  after reading some of the reports of possible nhl moves to milwaukee or that  milwaukee should have an nhl team i thought id pass along a story i heard  recently  this is second hand so i dont know how true it is but i have  no reason to doubt it either    bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge  hockey team  the owner of the admirals sorry i cant remember his name  either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the  bradley center  lloyd pettit     supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise but   turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of 00 million was too  high    like i said i dont know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if  its true dont look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon  the admirals  arent going to be forced out of the building and you wont see an nhl club  and a minor league club in the same building especially since the nbas  milwaukee bucks play there as well  yes it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the nhl for 00m but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much  less than that he felt that no one would pay 00m for an expansion team and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that but the market fooled him and 0 teams have been created for 00m apiece in the last three years and even the existing teams cant be moved for less than  00m and i doubt that he could get one for that little  pettit gambled and lost now hell have to pay more  sg

  the san francisco bay area media is reporting tonight that the detroit red wings beat the toronto maple leafs 00  can someone who is not part of the media conspiracy against the leafs tell me how the game really went i am expecting a 00 win for the leafs shutout for potvin hat trick for andreychuk and a goal and 0 assists for gilmour  if the leafs really lost how many penalties did whichever biased ref was at the game have to call against the leafs to let the red wings win  thank you very much  roland dreier                                        dreiermathberkeleyedu   sorry to disappoint you but the red wings earned the victoryeasily  i watched most of the game on espn as soon as i realized that they were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second the maple leafs were flat  very flat  meanwhile the red wings were skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game  i didnt detect any bad penalty calls van hellemond did his usual good job toronto looked like how i expected them to for their first playoff game in a few years  nervous  for the leafs sake i hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies for game 0  if game 0 is indicative of the series its gonna go quick  tom galvin       galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil  
  in article 0qup0linnotbmastercsrosehulmanedu swartzjhrosevcrosehulmanedu writes does anyone have the games espn will be airing this week  hopefully the detroittoronto game tongiht  i though abc did a decent job by getting some  fking no hockey games televised nationally tonight  what the hell is this  why the hell is espn showing some stupid baseball game when baseball is not even three weeks into the season and hockey is in the playoffs  no wait i know the answer   but still  it really pisses me off to no end  they better start putting some more fcking games on or they will never make any money off of the deal that brought hockey back to espn  aargh  not that id watch anyway but hockey needs all the publicity it can get       keith kellerlets go rangers lets go quakers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs     a cow is not a vegetarian dish   keith keller 0000  you obviously dont understand how tv scheduling works  espn had prior contracts to baseball to show monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance  the nhl tv deal was very late in the scheduling process you normally have to do this oneplus year out  the nhl package was finished two weeks before the season started  espn has shown tremendous commitment to the nhl by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could like the last minnesota game and putting stanley cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night  but the bottom line is that espn cannot break contracts at will  they must honor the previous deals they made   does have something to do with it especially if you risk a  lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball  so relax  im happy  i dont get sportschannel anyway  tom galvin              galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil   
   us easterners who have newspapers with editors unsympathetic to playoff pools often dont get summaries from west coast games since they finish too late at night for the morning edition  i and im sure others too would greatly appreciate it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games could be posted to this group right away basically all we need are goal scorers and assists dont bother with times penalties shots etc  this would make a lot of poolobsessed people very happy  i guess with the senators out golfing now the  local papers have lost interest    thanks  kd

000 mark  the kings shot the puck into the near corner of the flames zone  vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it  donnelly who was behind him wacked at the puck

he passed  the puck into the low slot on the far side to carson who shot off the pass  beating vernon on the ice stick side  at the 0000 mark skrudland went off for slashing and stern went crazy as he went after shuchuk  stern wound up with a double minor for roughing a single minor for cross checking and a 00 minute misconduct and he took the flames right out of the game  on the plus side  the kings for the most part played very disciplined hockey as they let calgary retaliate  the kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing  on the minus side  the kings lost almost every

   i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they face them in the finals which is what all the detroit sportswriters  are predicting  although i think bryan murray is probably the best gm i have ever seen in hockey im not as impressed with his abilities as a bench coach or in general as a motivator  with the amount of talent he has on this team he should have blown away everyone in the norris  there is not another team in the norris maybe even in the campbell conference that can hold a candle to detroit on paper in terms of pure talent  but some guys have not been pulling their weight at times this year  scotty bowman on the other hand who has won i think correct me if im wrong nine 0 stanley cups is an outstanding coach and i think he could outcoach murray if they faced each other     bryan murray has done very little as gmyzerman fedorov cheveldae chaisson the whole russian strategy was a product of the previous gmmurray has made a couple of decent tradesthats about it that would hardly rank him as the best gm  wasnt primeau murrays first decision as gm  gerald

  i think that jack ferreiras firing eventually led to kingstons firing  you mention consistency of vision  i think the sharks lost that with the loss of ferreira  there has never been a 0 headed gm that has ever worked  you need one person making the personnel decisions at the top not management by committee  the conventional wisdom from around the league is that ferreira would have made the moves that would have fielded a better product on the ice  how exactly would ferreira accomplished this  the threeheaded gmship has taken a lot of heat but nobodys explained how things would have been any different had ferreira still been there  would ferreira have made more trades  who would have he had traded  would he have made fewer trades who should not have been traded  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

   matthew rush writes  is there an award for best backup behind a hockey great underneath all the hype about lemieux stevens jagr ulf etc ron francis has quietly put together a 000 point season 00 goals and 00 assists in 00 games  that was probably the best acquisition the penguins have made since getting lemieux apologies to rick tocchet who has had a hell of a year himself  the pens got just the right person at just the right time when they got francis before the playoffs two years ago to backup mario  who was the secondline center before they got francis  i remember randy gilhen who really plays tough an ace in the faceoff circle but nobody with all the skills francis has scoring passing winning faceoffs and putting 000 into every game every night  just wanted to glow a little  i know what you mean  i glow everytime ronnies out on the ice in fact one of the neatest things about seeing the pens in person is that i can key in on him instead of watching what id probably be seeing on tv  he does so many subtle things behind the play  he said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing twoway hockey that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart  he was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in pittsburgh to the team whose forwards for the most part couldnt and wouldnt play a lick of defense  its really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the pens  you mention rick tocchet and he has certainly helped and even ol kjell has been steady  but looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the lineup permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it wouldnt matter  if i had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 0 tom barrasso 0 ron francis 0 larry murphy  id love to put francis first but i do think the only thing that could really damage the pens right now would be to lose barrasso  mom

  aargh  paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the nhl he called a total of 0 penalties on the habs and one on the nordiques the nords penalty came in ot  stewart being an exnordique himself was looking to call penalties on the habs while letting the nords get away with murderwe was robbed  no  patrick roy is the reason the game was lost and ron hextall is the reason quebec won  everybody said it would come down to goaltending that goaltending was the key etc etc  well the key doesnt quite fit if youre montreal  the dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call but lets face it he literally left his feet to throw an elbow  blaming stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow  he even saw the whole shot dammit  besides stewart evened things up a bit by calling a quebec penalty in ot  montreal played a solid game although they still dont know how to clear traffic in front of the net the loss of schneider will hurt even more  normally i would say that any team that blows a 0goal lead with less than  five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time in a playoff game  especially needs to be smacked upside their collective heads  but i dont think this was a team loss although keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first quebec goal  roy is paid big money to  play  he looked like a player in an industrial league on sakics shot  demers should start racicot in the next game  if not that he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or twoand maybe this article if possible  patrick roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal he was shaky and on his knees for the rest of the night  the winning goal shouldnt have gone in  i didnt think the wraparound was as bad as the second goal  i also didnt think scott young should have gotten around the defender cant remember who in the first place  but you are correct it shouldnt have gone in regardless  oh well at least the bruins lost in ot also ha ha  yep  moog looked bad on mogilnys goal with five seconds left in the second imo  how about neely though   holy shit what a player  speaking of great players manohman can quebec skate  i havent seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time  watching them break out of their zone especially sundin is a treat to watch  they remind me of the red  army    but i still hate the team  on the rest of the games  didnt st louis winning goal come on a powerplay  penalties will cost chicago dearly especially against detroit  same goes for calgary very very undisciplined  when marty mcsorely is waving guys to the bench to avoid fights you know somethings up  new jersey was overmatched terreris heroics notwithstanding  mario is unbelievable and jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs  but i  hate that team anyway    dchhabrastplistsca pissedoff habs fan     
   well its not that bad but i am still pretty pissed of at the local abc coverage they cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing  stuff deleted  ok heres the solution to your problem  move to canada  yesterday i was able to watch four gamesthe njpitt at 000 on abc lacal at 000 cbc  buffbos at 000 tsn and fox and monque at 000 cbc  i think that if each series goes its max i could be watching hockey playoffs for 00some odd consecutive nights i havent counted so thats a pure guess  i have two tvs in my house and i set them up sidebyside to watch monque and keep an eye on bosbuff at the same time  i did the same for the two afternoon games  btw those abc commentaters were great  i was quite impressed they seemed to know that their audience wasnt likely to be wellschooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job  they were quite impartial also imo    dchhabrastplistsca not suffering from a shortage of hockey here  
  evan pritchard writes  i think that you are incorrect roger  patrick smythe and adams all played or coached in the league before becoming front office types  hence they did help build the league although they were not great players themselves    punch imlachs contributions as a coach and gm were far greater than those of the above combined  should we name a division or trophy after him  owner vs player contributions deleted are we going to honour those who contributed to the leagues evolution or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the  sport itself   stuff deleted  the money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on and that is it is the players that are what make the game great and not the people who put them on the ice    as i recall the author of the original article that started the thread claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons  roger on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a jingoistic rant but you also supported the namechanging on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent fwiw i do not think the flaming was warranted nor do i  think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all  just an  observation  however that aside the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it making it easier for the casual fan or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour  imo the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports  in addition i do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey so its a pointless exercise anyway  if the current names are inappropriate then that is a separate issue not  central to the original article  something to consider additionally is whether or not players like orr who contributed to the glory of the sport would have been able to do so without an organized professional league to play in  in this case honouring builders of the league as opposed to builders of the sport becomes a chickenandegg type question although it was the chicken  exactly true  naming divisions and trophies after smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put stein in the hall of fame  i have always thought that this was nonsense  dunno if the stein comparison is justifiable since it doesnt look as though his unanimous acceptance to the hall will hold up    dchhabrastplistsca  
   on all replays joe murphys goal shouldnt have counted   the game would have ended in 00 tie   i thought the red light went onthus in the review the presumption would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the netfrom the replays i say even from the rear the evidence wasnt conclusive that the puck was in or outin my opinion  i was under the impression that the objective is to find conclusive evidence that the puck did cross the line  and the replays i saw showed  fairly conclusively that the puck did not cross the goal line at any time anyway  somebody screwed up     dchhabrastplistsca

  golchowyalchemychemutorontoca gerald olchowy writes  bryan murray has done very little as gmyzerman fedorov cheveldae chaisson the whole russian strategy was a product of the previous gmmurray has made a couple of decent tradesthats about it that would hardly rank him as the best gm  wasnt primeau murrays first decision as gm  gerald  there are many teams in the nhl who have taken a liking to russian players the whole russian strategy is not specific to detroit or to devellano who was gm before murray  what the previous gm also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams most notably in my memory murray craven who had a few very good years with philly after leaving here  also its not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team but the quality of them  trading adam oates for bernie federko was just plain stupid even if federko used to be a  great player at one time  most of murrays trades have worked significantly to the wings advantage with those that didnt being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved such as troy crowder who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered  put scotty bowman pat burns or any of the other better coaches in the  league behind the bench of this detroit team and they could beat anybody  randy

  collingannarborappliconslbcom michael collingridge writes    and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded   resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other   team captain trivia would be appreciated    luc robitaille was captain of the kings the first third of the season until the great one came back from his disc injury it was kind of awkward but melrose appointed anointed tgo as captain immediately upon his return after which he did not score a goal for something like 00 games  i think luc should have remained captain all season  dvb

  apparently part 0 defensemen numbered 0 through 00 was lost when i posted it to make things worse i lost my own copy  i have asked on the sharks mailing list on which it did get out to see if someone can mail me a copy back  if someone responds i will repost it when i get it otherwise i will rewrite it in a day or two and post it  sorry about that  0larry depalmaseason0rd acquired0000 free agent from minnesota gradei cd  no netterfan watching the sharks including me knows where depalma was at the end of the season the sharks appeared to still have his rights but he wasnt in san jose he wasnt in kansas city and his name hasnt appeared on the waiver wire  and that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for depalma  after being called up october 00 against the tampa bay lightning depalma had an excellent week scoring 0 points in 0 games while playing good defense  unfortunately the 00yearold depalma then disappeared the rest of the way getting just 0 more points in 00 more games and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice  he then was sent down to kansas city walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of shark bytes as the mailing list is now known to sharks officials faithful and neither the sharks nor we miss him  00johan garpenlovseason 0rd acquired0000 trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and 0th round pick in 00 entry draft from vancouver gradeaa  after an early slump garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way finishing with 00 points in 00 games second highest total on the team as he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau  kisio got most of the credit but garpenlov finishing second in the mvp voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders getting a clubhigh 00 power play goals  contrary to his previous rep garpenlov also showed that despite his small size 0 00 000 lbs he was willing to throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet  he also still needs to work on his defense although he improved tremendously throughout the season and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season  he will be a major key to the offense next year  00david bruceseason 0th acquired0000 from st louis in expansion draft gradei   after a banner 0000 when he led the team in powerplay goals 00 and was third in total scoring 00 points in 00 games bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury which kept him out of the lineup for all by 00 games this season  of course it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury but the 00yearold bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the sharks first season and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well  the injury appears serious which is a shame because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead his future with the sharks next season appears clouded  00mark pedersonseason0rd acquired0000 trade with philadelphia for clw dave snuggerud gradei b  it is difficult for me to understand the flyers decision to unload pederson after a very good offensive season last season 00 points in 00 games but after riding the pine early in the season pederson was summarily sent to the sharks in exchange of the defensiveminded snuggerud and he finished with 00 games combined with the flyers and the sharks  he was also limited by injuries this season and this limited his production 00 points  but when healthy pederson appears impressive with a good scoring touch good size and the willingness to throw it around although hes not considered a physical forward and good speed  he also does not appear to be a liability on defense but the sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much exactly pederson can do  00john carterseason 0th acquired0000 free agent from boston gradei bb  carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team and the hard work worked wonders as at times he looked great on ice  however although he did look great at times the fact that he received just 00 points in 00 games for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do and the sharks confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about 00 games left in the season  carter who will turn 00 on may 0 always hussled but as a result was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but he was generally a credit on the defensive end but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity and he did not impress offensively although he was one of the best sharks at drawing penalties  he is very unlikely to be back next season  00jeanfrancois quintinseason 0st acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradei bb  i dont understand why the sharks didnt let quintin play any more than the 00 games he played this season  he was generally hardworking and creating opportunities offensively and appeared at age 00 ready for regular nhl duty at least for a team like the sharks finishing with 0 points in those 00 games while not being a defensive liability  shoulder injury in training camp before the 0000 season limited quintin the teams leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two to just 00 games with the sharks and the blades that season but he looked impressive  he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season  00mark beaufaitseason 0st acquired0nd round pick in 0000 supplemental draft gradei   after a allstar season at kansas city beaufait got a cup of coffey with the sharks late in the season when the blades knocked down a playoff spot and the sharks decimated with injuries playing 0 games and scoring a goal for his only nhl point thus far  despite small size 0 0 000 lbs beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary and looked pretty good at times although its too early to judge him based on 0 nhl games in which he played mostly left wing away from his center position at northern michigan and kansas city  00jaroslav otevrelseason 0st acquired0th round pick in 0000 entry draft gradei   like beaufait otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea 0 games midway through the season  he was generally very much of a defensive liability and did not show much offensively either although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 0 games  he may need another season to work on his defense but once his defense is acceptable he should be ready  00michel picardseason 0st acquired0000 trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau gradei bc  the 00yearold picard although he perennially tore up the minors seems to be close to being out of chances for some reason after being acquired by the sharks but failing to impress the management in 00 games scoring 0 goals for his only points and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city he was not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors he has failed thus far to score in the nhl although he has been given limited opportunities  he may be the sharks bait in the expansion draft  00dody woodseason 0st acquired0rd round pick in 0000 entry draft gradei dd although perhaps i shouldnt give a grade at all  i have been accused of knocking on wood too much   then it is probably no surprise to you that i am thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far although 00 games is a small example  he was generally a nonfactor on offense was not particularly good defensively and took too many silly penalties losing many fights in the process and gathering 00 penalty minutes in those 00 games projecting to to 000 in an 00game season  hes not ready and needs at least another season at kc where he can work on his fighting skills if nothing else  his relatively small size 0 00 000 lbs does not give much

  i finally got it back with great thanks to mark spiegel for saving and sending it    0rob zettlerseason0th acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradecc  zettler gave the sharks every bit hes got this year unfortunately this still wasnt enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler if that  he works hard for sure but is no better than average on defense and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times while being basically an offensive zero 0 goal and 0 assists in 00 games  he would be hardpressed to make the team next year  0david williamsseason 0nd acquired0000 free agent from new jersey gradecc  imo williams was the most valuable defenseman for the sharks in 0000 playing a combination of good offense 0 goals and 00 assists in 00 games and good defense  but he playing the first part of this season in kansas city was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it then appears that 0000 was a fluke  although he improved towards the end of the season he was prone to being out of position defensively and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the teams leading scorer among defensemen last year  he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year  0jayson moreseason 0nd acquired0000 from montreal in expansion draft gradeb  after being touted as the teams top defensive prospects in training camp before 0000 more had a rather disappointing 0000 as he was not particularly good defensively and had just 00 points in 00 games  he then proceeded to improve his game massively this season becoming the teams most reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional but only occasional offensive flash offensively he was even more disappointing than last year 00 points in 00 games but his defense improved tremendously  he is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman  0neil wilkinsonseason 0th acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradeb  wilkinson was probably the teams top defensive defenseman in 0000  however partially because of injuries he was not the same this year as he missed 00 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries and seemed to be slowed even when playing  he then had often to be saved by his defensive partners that is if they are there at all  but he also had some solid games and if he can be complete healthy he can still be a force  0sandis ozolinshseason 0st acquired0000 0nd round pick in entry draft gradei a  at the time of his injury december 00 against the philadelphia flyers ozolinsh was well on track to be imo the teams mvp  a serious knee injury in that game though forced him to miss the rest of the season 00 games but he still finished as the teams top scorer among defensemen 00 points which of course tells more about the lack of offense the sharks had from their defensemen but it also tells of ozolinshs abilities  at the time he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still susceptible to socalled rookie mistakes but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team rookie or veteran  if he can come back from his injuries he is ready to be a star  00doug zmolekseason 0st acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradeb  zmolek had basically a solid and durable year being one of the only two sharks to play in all 00 games of the season  he was solid on defense but after being billed as an offensive defenseman he didnt show it 00 points he was also prone to penalties and his 000 penalty minutes was second on the team however that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents and he was at his best when playing physically  but to become a fixture in this league he needs to improve both offensively and defensively and cut down on the number of powerplays he gives to opponents   go calgary flames  al macinnis for norris  gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in edmonton  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu recsporthockey contact for the san jose sharks      
   i forgot to ask is this the highest points total francis has had in a season  has he ever had a 000 point season before either with the pens or the whalers   francis got 000 in 0000 his last full season with hartford  in agreement with your previous post i think francis is a tremendous and generally underrated complete player  i would love to have him here in a capitals uniform where he would certainly be the 0 center even though pivonka is also a very good complete player who is generally underrated francis impresses me in many ways as an ethical dale hunter  tons of heart and cando attitude with a lot of different skills but none of the cheap shots and few penalty minutes  not to mention nearly always coming through when its important

  golchowyalchemychemutorontoca gerald olchowy writes  bryan murray has done very little as gmyzerman fedorov cheveldae chaisson the whole russian strategy was a product of the previous gmmurray has made a couple of decent tradesthats about it that would hardly rank him as the best gm  there are many teams in the nhl who have taken a liking to russian players the whole russian strategy is not specific to detroit or to devellano who was gm before murray  what the previous gm also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams most notably in my memory murray craven who had a few very good years with philly after leaving here  also its not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team but the quality of them  trading adam oates for bernie federko was just plain stupid even if federko used to be a  great player at one time  most of murrays trades have worked significantly to the wings advantage with those that didnt being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved such as troy crowder who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered   devallano went earlier and more extensively to the russian strategy than anyone elseand was the first gm to waste high draft choices on young russiansdevallano would still be gm but he succombed to demers pleading to make the oatesfederko et al tradewhich is the deal that sealed his fate  murray has made some decent tradesno doubtbut these are more due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on his partwashington was too cheap to pay ciccarelli so they essentially gave him awayand carson was really a big anchor to the team and he was able to sucker a rookie gm to give him paul coffey for deadweight  if detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short then he will have wasted an opportunity because manson was available and he was unable to pull the trigger  it is his judgement that he has enough with what hes gotyzerman doesnt have that many more years in his prime  gerald  
   gerald murray wasnt responsible for primeau although im not ready to admit thats a horrible pick  they hired him after the draft which has never made sense to me  his first pick was lapointe   i dont think primeau is necessarily a bad pickim was just trying to locate the beginning of murrays decisionshe slowness in trading carson has delayed primeaus developmentand you have to wait longer for big players oftenand primeau can be a very good player without being a pointagameplayer especially on a team that has yzerman and fedorovif primeau becomes joel otto and gets 00 goals a season and plays meanit will have been an extremely good pick  gerald

   here is a press release from the white house   remarks by president clinton to ncaa division i champion hockey team april 00 qa following  to national desk  contact white house office of the press secretary 0000000000     washington april 00  following is a transcript of remarks by president clinton to the university of maine black bears ncaa division i hockey champions                             the rose garden   000 am edt       the president  good morning ladies and gentlemen  its an honor for me to welcome the university of maine black bears the winner of the ncaa division i hockey national championship to the rose garden and the white house  i understand from senator mitchell that this is the first team from the university of maine every to win a national championship  and were glad to have them here       im inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory       coming from a state that is also relatively small in size but also filled with pride and tradition and community i can understand how the people of maine must feel about the black bears in our state people are still talking about the time we won the orange bowl over the number one ranked football team and that was back in 0000  im sure that 00 years from now the people of maine will as proud of this team as they are today       you know in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey  we dont have a lot of ice  laughter but after spending three months getting banged around in this town i can understand a little more about hockey than i did before i came here  hockey is a tough game  its a hardhitting sport  it does have one virtue though theres a penalty for delay of game  i wish we had that rule in the senate  laughter       in government as in hockey leadership is important  in the united states senate our team has a great captain the majority leader and the senior senator from maine george mitchell junior senator  cohen looks so young i cant imagine  laughter  im actually bitter about senator cohen because he looks so much younger than me       on your hockey team the captain jim montgomery has done a great job  he scored the winning goal late in the championship game leading you to a comefrombehind victory  something else i know a little bit about       sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities  i share the pride that senator mitchell and senator cohen and congressman andrews and all the people of maine must feel for the black bears who have shown us all how to play as a team how to bring out the best in one another and how to come from behind       i think its important as i ask young people from around america who have achieved outstanding things in working together to come here to the white house to be recognized and appreciated by their country to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives       we now have another role model and im glad to have them here today  applause       the president is presented with team jersey applause       the president  thats great  i love it  its beautiful applause       the president is presented with an autographed stick       the president  thank you  thats great  applause                                           q  mr president did you authorize the move on waco this morning sir       the president  i was aware of it  i think the attorney general made the decision  and i think i should refer all questions to her and to the fbi       q  did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed       the president  no they made the tactical decisions that was their judgment the fbi       q  is this a raid       the president  and i will  i want to refer you to  talk to the attorney general and the fbi  i knew it was going to be done but the decisions were entirely theirs all the tactical decisions       q  what did you and senator mitchell talk about this morning       q  any chance for that stimulus package       the president  senator mitchell ought to pay my quarter  laughter  i was in there  laughter       senator mitchell  you have to pay that quarter       the president  i was ready  laughter  senator mitchell hes worth a quarter any day       q  any chance for your bill sir       the president  we talked about what was going to happen this week in the senate and about what other meetings were going to have for the rest of the week  we only had about five minutes to talk  and we agreed wed get back together later around noon and talk some more       q  senator dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise       the president  well i know he did but look senator dole and a lot of the other republicans now in the senate voted for the same kind of thing for ronald reagan in 0000 and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 00 emergency spending measures totalling over 000 billion when reagan and bush were president in those administrations  and many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the american people back to work  i dont want to go back and revisit every one but you   can do it  you can look at the research there  so this position theyre taking is not credible  we have a very tough fiveyear deficit reduction plan  all these costs are covered during that time and then some  and the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for dont have much of a history on which to base their position  theyve got 00 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the american people back to work  so i think weve got a chance to work it out and im hopeful well see what happens today and tomorrow  im feeling pretty good about it       the press  thank you                                   end       0000 am edt   00

      ok heres the solution to your problem  move to canada  yesterday i was able  to watch four gamesthe njpitt at 000 on abc lacal at 000 cbc   buffbos at 000 tsn and fox and monque at 000 cbc  i think that if  each series goes its max i could be watching hockey playoffs for 00some odd  consecutive nights i havent counted so thats a pure guess  the worst thing is that this is exactly what i did last year  i had the rangers on msg and the two different games on scny and sca on at the same time  yes id rather have sc cover it just for the amount of coverage     btw those abc commentaters were great  i was quite impressed they seemed  to know that their audience wasnt likely to be wellschooled in hockey lore  and they did an excellent job  they were quite impartial also imo  i think thorne earns his money  the best part is that he is the same way when  he is earning his  from sportschannel as the devils announcer ie unbiased  he goes orgasmic for goals despite which team scores and even more  excited if possible for great saves  he did a good job of explaining certain  things to nonhockey types without offending those of us who follow the sport unlike nbcs clowns for the asg  jpc  ob playofftime flamebait        dont any of you pittsburgh fans tell me how mike lange is better        maybe if he were a little spontaneous rather than reading rehearsed       lines of bs having nothing to do with hockey he would be better     john p curcio           go bruins   philips laboratories jpcphilabsphilipscom            000 scarborough road 000 0000000                     briarcliff manor ny 00000

  how long can the leafs play shorthanded and still be expected to score  they did some fine penelykilling in the first 0 men down for a couple of minutes at one point but they just couldnt keep it  up  they spent virtually the entire game either shorthanded or just coming off a penelty  as soon as theyd get regrouped theyre penalized again   sheesh  like gilmour said after the 0st  you cant go calling  every little push an shove in a game like that  and if youre going to you have to do it for both teams   pearson one of my four favorite leafs played like a bonehead  i saw him personally screw up at least 0 good scoring opportunities and then he got that bonehead 0minute major highsticking penalty   cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a handfull of games ago and he played a good game  if the other players on his line can smarten up that line should do okay  clarks got to get tough  hes got to intimidate and go for the net  send clark up the left  wing over the blue line a couple times his patented wrist shot will put some numbers on the board and pearson heck maybe he should be benched   i hate to repeat grapes but where the heck was foligno  zezel cant do all the checking himself  and get macllwain on the move we  need some speed out there  keep potvin in net he did okay  considering although like i said a couple weeks ago potvin  messed up in a couple games in the ahl playoffs last year  he can  easily do it again   my prediction last week was toronto in 0  that the games det wins  will be blowouts and the game tor wins will be close  i still stand by that   dont fret leafs fans in order to win in 0 the other team has to win 0    burns is going to make some magic  hell mix up some lines  match the wings lineperline  hell have his team checking hard and hell never let them get outnumbered in their own end  the leafs will win wednesday night and will take 0 or their home games probably the first one   stephen leaf legge sleggekeanucsmunca

   are people here stupid or what it is a tie breaker of cause they  have to have the same record how can people be sooooo stuppid to put win as  first in the list for tie breaker if it is a tie breaker how can there be  different record man i thought people in this net are good with hockey  i might not be great in math but tell me how can two teams ahve the same points  with different record manretard cant believe people actually put  win as first in a tie breaker  then allow me to enlighten you rex you see theres a thing called a tie  a tie is worth one point i know i know youre not good at math but bear with me a win is worth two points so getting two ties is the same as  getting one win if your team played two games won one and lost one youd have two points if my team played two games and tied them both wed also have two points wed be tied in the standings even though our records are different  perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again i am starting to sound like roger or what  alan  
  gballenthudsonuvicca greg  ballentine writes  all of this is fine  i never said that murray was a bad gm  i merely said that he isnt the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor if murray is as great as you claim the wings would have won the stanley cup by now probably more than once  if he was as great a gm as you claim  i think you missed one of my points there  it takes more than a great gm to win a stanley cup even once  some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one  i agree that you and i could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best gm in hockey that is a matter of opinion and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine  but the point of my original original post if not well stated was that murray has the gm abilities but not the coaching abilities  which leads to below  and he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success  i think at this point theres a personal emotional element involved here which transcends murrays logical thought  as outsiders its fine for  us to say he should hire a different coach  in fact he has talked about doing so in the past  but the press here in detroit at least has so built up this business about murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach that i think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he is capable of coaching a team past the second round  he needs to as the papers say get that monkey off his back so it becomes a matter not of intelligence but of pride  is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic  perhaps but were all a little that way from time to time  i think eventually hell step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his gm duties and the team will improve as a result  i think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on gm work  in that sense once he steps down as coach well see how good of a gm he really is  but murray is an average unspectacular nhl coach and a pretty good gm so none of this is true anyway  i may not agree with everything youve said but its been fun discussing it with you  gregmeister  randy   
  i cant believe that espn is making sportschannel america look good  but only in nynj philadelphia and chicago everywhere else the only reason sportschannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts and local baseball preempted the nhl playoffs thus far into this playoff season espnabc has given me more hockey in 0 days 0 game than sportschannel did 0 games  if people want hockey on tv they should watch hockey on tv i bet the ratings for hockey on sunday on abc went into the toilet next week there will be far fewer abc affiliates with hockey  someone in this thread said that he wouldnt watch the games even if they were on tv and this is a rsh regular contributor  xenophobes north of border neednt fear the usamericanization of our game because usamericans will never figure out how to market hockey here support your team support your game    mike eisler mreengsuncom  not only are they leafs the best team but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburghs  their  players are mighty bright too  i mean he really was going to get his  wallet back right jan brittenson 000 on leafpen woofers in  recsporthockey  
  in article 00apr00000000000000vm0mcgillca jbe0 jbe0musicbmcgillca writes aargh  paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the nhl he called a total of 0 penalties on the habs and one on the nordiques the nords penalty came in ot  stewart being an exnordique himself was looking to call penalties on the habs while letting the nords get away with murderwe was robbed  no  patrick roy is the reason the game was lost and ron hextall is the reason quebec won  everybody said it would come down to goaltending that goaltending was the key etc etc  well the key doesnt quite fit if youre montreal    i dont buy this at all roy was the reason the game was tied and that would not have been the case had dionne kept his cool  hextall gave up 0 very questionable goals himself  both dionnes and bellows shots were misplayed by hextall but just because his gaffes were early in the game no one seems to care roy stood on his head  for the first 00 minutes of the game when the nords were rushing from  endtoend kamenskys minibreak after the tying goal and the first shot by  young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy roy outplayed hextall  for most of the game but roy becomes the villain and hextall the hero  because roys team didnt make full use of their opportunities  hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces  he played very  well but the haller shot off the post in ot the rebound bouncing over  bellows stick the brunet breakaway the 0 chances for leclair  all  those opportunities were not finished off by montreal and it cost them hextall wasnt particularly brilliant on those plays    blaming stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow  he even saw the whole shot dammit  sure no excuse  but it was just the 0 goal the timing stank but against an explosive team like quebec they gave them 0 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary  montreal played a solid game although they still dont know how to clear traffic in front of the net the loss of schneider will hurt even more   i disagree roy played well because he wasnt screened the whole night  the defense for the 0st time this season played remarkably keeping sakic nolan and sundin  out of the slot most of the night  normally i would say that any team that blows a 0goal lead with less than  five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time in a playoff game  especially needs to be smacked upside their collective heads but i dont think this was a team loss although keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first quebec goal    this most certainly was a team loss leclair missed his opportunities as did bellows and brunet dionne took a bad penalty damphousse and lebeau were silent carbonneau and savard were a step behind all night roy gave up the bad goal roy by no means can be singled out for this loss  roy is paid big money to  play  he looked like a player in an industrial league on sakics shot  and hextall didnt on dionnes goal please roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies  and he still is in the top 0 when you consider the defense or lack of one that played in front of him for most of the season  demers should start racicot in the next game  if not that he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or twoand maybe this article if possible  the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the habs they are no better than uninformed fans why should they read the papers they played 00 minutes of burnsian hockey to shut down quebec all they need tonight and for the rest of the series is the  extra 0  red light to face quebecrubbish thats a guaranteed way to end the series 00 who would be taught a lesson by this  the fans the media and racicot perhaps certainly not the rest of the team  i didnt think the wraparound was as bad as the second goal  i also didnt think scott young should have gotten around the defender cant remember who in the first place  but you are correct it shouldnt have gone in regardless  if you mean the goal should never have gone in because there should never have been an ot then i agree but the goal itself was a great piece of work by young roy had both the near and far posts covered but young flipped the puck up under roys arm as he wrappedaround the net  not a bad goal at all  yaska   yaskaeecgtorontoedu  dept of electrical  computer engineering sankar                          university of toronto toronto canada

    to those who are wondering what is happening in minnesota    from what i have seen in the local news tv and newspaper various people  in the area are trying to get a new hockey team  a columnist for the st  paul pioneer press wrote an article giving the inside scoop on the  issue  there are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the twin cities  first the sites target center civic  center st paul and yes even the met center  the columnist was pretty  confident that minnesota will get a team and that the target center will  ultimately win out  he argued however that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably  without the  intersite competition the columnist sorry i cant remember his name  believes that minnesota would have a team by the 000000 season  also  because of the situation with the timberwolves things will be delayed  until unless the city of minneapolis takes over the target center   however they are unlikely to do so until the met center is destroyed  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the met for  conventions and shortterm events even with hockey at target  to add to  this mess a study 0 to 00 months is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the met center which obviously delays the process even  further  i hope that the study is cancelled which will have the effect of  knocking the met center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  minneapolis to take over the target center sooner the city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the met  which may happen regarding possible candidates the three teams are  hartford tampa bay and new jersey  i would prefer the devils minnesota  ice demons although the lightning may have potential  although it hasnt  been announced yet it looks like 0 neutral site games will be played at the  target center next year  apparently the devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible and i wouldnt be surprised to see  hartford and tampa show up there eitherso minnesota may end up  getting another team but it may take a few years   go sabres  robert andolina former buffalonian living in minneapolis randolinpolisciumnedu

  i agree it was great for the espn people to show the detroit game my roommate just about sht when they threw the octopus on the ice thanks for explaining the significance of that btw the only problem i had was when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and music especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report other then that hats off to espn now if theyll only make a habit of this yeah right baseball seasons started zzzzzz   koz   lets go caps  
   someone give sportchannel a call or maybe ted turner  wasnt usa network covering the playoffs years ago    jim g  oh to be back in the good old days when i lived in florida florida for petes sake and could watch hockey every night as espn and usa alternated coverage nights oh well i guess it would be too simple for the home office to look back into their past to solve a problem in the present  of course i shouldnt complain at least im getting to watch the playoffs for a change hooray now if the espn schedulers will realise there are other teams except pittsberg in the patrick sounds like a dr suess book   koz  lets go caps  
  hell is anderson  anderson can in days past get under peoples skin  put a little more bluntly anderson has to be an asshole he used to be good at it  we need him now    agreed anderson was nowhere last night   well what do you expectburns was playing him with krushelnyski and baumgartneranderson is a finisherunless you play him with someone to can get him the puck in a finishing positionhe aint going to do much scoring  gerald  
  this is a general question for us readers  how extensive is the playoff coverage down there  in canada it is almost impossible not to watch a series on tv ie the only two series i have not had an opportunity to watch this year are washnyi and chistl the latter because im in the wrong time zone  we in canada are basically swamped with  coverage and i wonder how many seriesgames are televised nationally or even locally in the us and how much precedence they take over say local news if the games go into doubleot  email me so as not to waste bandwidth please  my news feed is kind of slow anyways  l0tr   
    game two of the detroit  toronto series will be a rougher game  i believe that clark will be coming out hitting on all cylindars  i believe that probert will take exception to this and a fight between clark and probert will result   i know this sounds kind of ridiculous but i know game two toronto will come out hitting   any takers on this issue

   in article 0klundergradmathuwaterlooca kwk0chowdescartesuwaterlooca kevin c writes  thanks for the goals by steve smith   i dont see why more people dont blame grant fuhr for the goal that smith   put in his own net its common to play the puck back to your own goalie when  deep in your own end and under little or no pressure from the offensive team  if fuhr had been in position the puck would have never crossed the line  from this account it doesnt sound like you even saw the goal mike smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit fuhr in the back of the leg fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened the puck went straight off fuhrs leg and into the net fuhr never had a chance there was no play back to the goaltender in fact perry berezan of calgary had just dumped it in and smith was retrieving it   it was unfortunate that it happened smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time and on his birthday too but all the blame lies with him starting in peewee coaches tell players never to make a crossice pass in front of  their own net too much chance of having it intercepted or hitting the  goaltender or whatever  and to the people who say that smith cost the oilers the series i can only say that he certainly didnt cause the team to lose the other three games there was no reason for a powerhouse team like edmonton to be tied late in the third period of the 0th game of the second round everybody on the team has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation  alan  
   sleggekeanucsmunca writes   i was wtahcing right guard hockey week on tsn yesterday and they had a feature on this guy that does a lot most of the masks for nhl goalies  they talked about how they are made what they are made of and the designs that are put on them etc   the best one of all was one he never talked about he just held it up it has the current leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking  black panther on the forehead  it has to be a new mask for felix potvin but he never said whose it was    are you sure this program was current i know that grant fuhr  had a black panther on the forehead of his mask when he played with  the leafs   it would seem logical that the mask is potvins his nickname is the cat  which would go a long ways towards explaining the panther   of course it could be an old story and the mask is fuhrs too  alan

  by dave luecking of the postdispatch staff  at 000 thursday night the scoreboard watchers at the arena began to cheer their cheer quickly turned into a roar and finally the sellout crowd of 00000 rose as one to rock the old barn at 0000 oakland avenue in a salute to the playoffbound blues  the scoreboard had just flashed the news from detroit  red wings 0 stars 0 with the north stars loss the blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the norris division good thing because the blues quit playing  they held a 00 lead over tampa bay when the detroitminnesota final appeared with 0 minutes 00 remaining in the second period they promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 00 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer tampas bob beers tipped in a pass from shawn chambers but officiating supervisor john damico and video goal judge rich schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired  im glad i didnt see it go in at the end blues coach bob berry said  if the goal had counted hed have been more upset than he was by the blues disappearance in the final 00 minutes holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered berrys anger  it wasnt pretty at the end he said we played 00 00 great minutes as good as we played all year it slipped away at the end it shouldnt have but it did  still the blues won prompting another ovation from the crowd at games end despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season the blues still made the playoffs theyll meet the chicago blackhawks in a bestofseven norris division semifinal beginning at noon sunday at chicago stadium  the blues finished the regularseason with a record of 000000 for 00 points their fourth consecutive plus000 season minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place with a record of 0000 00 for 00 points tampa bay which played spoiler last week by tying the blues 00 at tampa ended its first season with a record of 00000 for 00 points  the poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous blues locker room instead the mood was one of relief and some disappointment  its a shame we let down said kevin miller one of three blues to score two goals brendan shanahan and bob bassen were the others there was no need for a letdown if wed have kept working it would have ended 00 and everyone would be happy  instead a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs we won and thats all that matters said brett hull scoreless and minus0 for the night once we got up 00 it was really tough to play  some players didnt have a problem  just because the score was announced our line didnt quit said rich sutter who played with bassen and miller we still had a game to play you cant allow five goals like we did thats not right  it was disappointing to see what was going on  bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the blues effort somehow he missed the announcement of minnesotas loss  i didnt know it was final he said i was kind of looking around on the bench i didnt realize it was a final for some reason were in the playoffs and thats great but its a little disappointing to play like we did at the end  the letdown was precisely the reason that berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the minnesotadetroit score off of the board the score showed 00 until it first popped up with detroit leading 00 in the third period the blues already led 00 at the time  i told them i didnt want to see the score i didnt want to know the score berry said i felt we had to win the game and thats the approach we took  if minnesota took a lead berry feared the pressure of having to win might bother the blues if detroit led he worried the blues might quit  until the announcement the blues played splendidly shanahan got the crowd going at 0000 of the first period scoring his 00th of the season then miller and bassen took charge late in the period  with the teams playing four on four miller broke in on left wing deked defenseman roman hamrlik and beat former blues goalie pat jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 000 seconds remaining in the period  then just 000 seconds later bassen rifled a long slap shot past jablonski after defenseman rick zombo intercepted a tampa pass in the neutral zone  bassen made it 00 just 00 seconds into the second period scoring on the  rebound of bret hedicans shot the goal gave him his first twogoal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend  last year bassen befriended young oliver mulvihill who died of a rare form of cancer at age 0 on feb 00  i was thinking of my buddy oliver bassen said hes in heaven now and i know he was watching i know hes happy  miller increased the blues lead to 00 on a breakaway goal set up by zombo at 0000 then steve maltais broke curtis josephs shutout just 00 seconds later making it 00  less than a minute after the north stars final was announced tim bergland scored and cut the lead to 00 but shanahan scored his 00st converting a pass from nelson emerson with 000 seconds remaining in the  second period  then it was all lightning adam creighton scored 00 seconds into the third period prompting berry to rest the overworked joseph guy hebert allowed goals to shawn chambers and danton cole in a span of 000 midway through the third period  the goals by chambers and cole made shanahans second goal stand up as the winner we were in there shanahan said the game was over we were in                                          a l l e z   l e s   b

  in article 0klundergradmathuwaterlooca kwk0chowdescartesuwaterlooca kevin c writes  thanks for the goals by steve smith  i dont see why more people dont blame grant fuhr for the goal that smith  put in his own net its common to play the puck back to your own goalie when deep in your own end and under little or no pressure from the offensive team if fuhr had been in position the puck would have never crossed the line  mike mcdowell  i have to disagree with you on this one  it is anything but common  in the 0 or 0 years i have been watching hockey i have never seen this happen ever  i am not sure what league you have been watching    anyone else agree with this   colin layfield             religion and sex are power plays                              manipulate the people for the money they pay  the university of calgary   selling skin selling god  computer science            the numbers look the same on their credit cards  layfieldcpscucalgaryca                            queensryche   
      how long would they support teams that are run on rangerbased   corporate thinking i use the term lightly  we dont need a good  product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawas  record every year0000 haha sorry had ta say it  look how long the maple leafs and nordiques used similar logic  not that they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams but the maple leafs and a certain dead man who was in charge were one of the cheapest teams in the history of the sport  guess what they were immensely popular at the gate  the nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the playoffs so many years in a row   look at british or any european soccer as an example they never have fan  problems  ha  such humor  they have major fan problems namely that on occasion some of them dont make it home from the match  the soccer fans tend to be fanatical much like the montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when they play pathetically   jpc     john p curcio           go bruins   philips laboratories jpcphilabsphilipscom            000 scarborough road 000 0000000                     briarcliff manor ny 00000

  well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while chicago sweeps stlouis that just makes it easier in the second round with all the rest they will get and tordet getting none for the conf champ they will have a hard time versus the division but that div will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the hawks again then bring pitt and sure the hawks will probably lose but its better to get that far and lose than to not go  brian   hopefully a miracle ok not quite a miracle but close will occur and pittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals  if they make it again  they will probably keep the cup  if they dont its the hawks turn  go blackhawks  congrats to jeremy roenick for being only the 0nd hawks player to post  back to back 00 goal seasons  scott

  slacellegandalfca stephane lacelle writes  the ottwawa senators fired mel bridgman at 000 pm today randy sexton is gonna replace him  trashy move from a trashy organization after the front office stated that nobody would lose their job over the sens poor performance bridgeman is gone within 00 hours of the teams final game  yesi know he screwed up letting the kings grab loach  sextons qualifications aside from being cheap   he played some us college hockey  hes pals with club president bruce firestone  just the kind of experience you need when trying to build an expansion franchise hell probably be in the hall of fame next year   this continues a tradition of front office gaffs  paul anka and the arena deal  denis potvin and the gm postion  mike bossy and the scoring coach  how do people in ottawa feel about how the club is being run  stephane lacelle  brian down bdownvistorontoedu  
   ive heard that you can score on belfour by shooting high  because he goes down a lot and on potvin by shooting high  on him and then getting the rebound in because he plays so deep in the net  any truth to these   brad  a wings fan but no predictions

  farewell minnesota fans  get stuffed dallas stars  as the north stars fade to black i hope that minneapolisst paul are not long without an nhl team  it just seems right that the hotbed of amateur hockey in the usa should have an nhl team as well  the loss of the team is certainly not the fault of the fans though the start of the 000000 season made it look real bad for a while  i wish now that i kept the north stars cap i bought at maple leaf gardens the morning after they eliminated montreal in 0000  i got it to spite the montreal fans in the small town where i grew up  what a glorious season that was for the north stars       dwarf  w jim jordan                           i dont mean to tell you how to live dwarfx000gatebnrca internet         your lifethats what the tvs for i work for bnr i do not speak for it   but if i didnt believe in jesus id                                          be going to hell       peter heath

    jagr has a higher  but francis has had more points  and take it from an informed observer ronnie francis has had a much better season than jaromir jagr  this is not to take anything away from jaro who had a  decent year although it didnt live up to the expectations of some  bowman tended to overplay francis at times because he is a bowmanstyle player  he plays hard at all times doesnt disregard his defensive responsibilities and is a good leader  bowman rewarded him be increasing his ice time  jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude this rubbed bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time  throughout the year francis consistently recieved more ice time than jagr  althouhg i have never seen stats on this subject i am pretty sure that jagr had more points per minute played that francis  when you add to that jagrs better  rating i think it becomes evident that jagr had a better season not that francis had a bad one  gregmeister  
  my vote goes to john vanbiesbrouck  his mask has a skyline of new york city and on the sides there are a bunch of bees beezer  it looks really sharp  funny you should mention this one time on hnic don cherry pointed out vanbiesbroucks mask  he hated it  i think he said something to the effect of you see  he was great last year now he goes out and gets that dopey mask  and he cant stop a beachball  you may or may not take cherry seriously at all but i cracked up when i heard it  i think ed belfour has the current best mask in the nhl btw  i also like moogs and ill give fuhrs new one an honourable mention although i havent seen it closely yet it looked good from a distance  whats also neat is chevaldaes in detroit they call him chevy so he has two checkered flags painted at the top as in an auto race

   joel alvstad writes  a fine 00 year history came to a close tonight as the minnesota north stars  or norms stars whichever you prefer lost to the red wings by a score of 00  the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen who netted two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to play  this is very sad indeed  my condolences to the minnesota fans who are losing their team  i fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team left in pittsburgh will be the steelers  we should always enjoy things when we can  you never know when theyll be taken away from us  mom    
  especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report  the wings player was yves racine and he returned later in that same period  mike  
  when is the draft this year  and will there be any coverage i know the upcomming nfl draft is on espn  anyone got the details  paul kariya 0000 0 pick no 0 perhaps  he wont last long   i dont know the exact coverage in the states  in canada it is covered by tsn so maybe espn will grab their coverage  i dont know  as for the picks ottawa picks 0 which means it is almost 000 that alexander daigle will  go 0 hell either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec  imo i would take kariya  he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in the world championships  daigle didnt show this for his junior team  san jose will then get kariya  tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov i think thats it or a      defenseman rob niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong  because of expansion i wont go further but i will name other of the blue chip prospects      chris gratton     chris pridham     a swedish player who i cant remember his name  draft order  0 ottawa 0 san jose 0 tampa bay 0 south florida or anahiem 0 south florida or anahiem 0 hartford 0 edmonton 0 dallas 0 ny rangers 00 philadelphia  the 0th thru 00th picks could be wrong  i dont have the standings here and am guessing   in my mind there are 0 top notch prospects in the draft with kariya   leading the way but not going 0  shawn  go caps two first round picks for the next three years  thanks                  stlouis or should i say ron caron and scott stevens

  but i have to agree boston is a good team  but streaky  they put together a great streak to capture first place in the adams but for what  they have lost the home ice advantage for at least the first round and might not make it out of it  i would love to see the sabres win the first round even though i bet on the bruins a 00pack    oh well perhaps i should start betting against the sabres more often       ciao                              jason bittle bittlecanisiusedu  aka pillsbury dough boy  quote i compute therefore i b m

  detroit is a very disciplined team  theres a lot of europeans in detroit which would make the game fast so toronto would have to slow the game down which means drawing penalties as a last resort anyway  toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players  toronto is just an average team detroit isnt ballard screwed toronto when he was owner  everyone knows that and its going to take time for toronto to become a real force i expect gilmour to be burnt out next year  he cant pull the whole team forever  patrick walker university of new brunswick

  jouko kylmaoja wrote    i watched the game germanyczechs in wc todayand i was astonished about  the behaviour of the german audience  the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went  grazy they threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis  that stupid or what i guess the canadian referee one of the  isostarbros  gave the german team a penalty for that but it didnt help  much  i guess the germans just are proud over their nazikillemalleveryone  butusgermanssucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude  in every possible sport remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer  it really pisses me off  i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks but   most of them seem to do  i can understand your anger about the german audience i mean it was the finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the canadien ref called in the last period the germans got a match penalty and a 00 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the german goalie got two minutes for delay of game for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd the resulting 00 skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point when the germans were starting to come up strong i am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in german sports events if you watch for example a tennis davis cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes because the crowd is so obnoxious but i have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries you should go to the us and watch the way they present the olympics on television or the soccer crowds in england or the finnish spectators at nordic skiing events i mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and i would rather see the best teamplayer win and get cheared at i do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and i have to admit that in most sports the german national site is not my favorite team to watch the german soccer team is boring to watch for example but reading the above posting i think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing it is easy to talk of nearly all germans as nazis and nationalists thats the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against germany it is true that there is a great danger of rearising nationalism in germany but from my experience most of the people at least of the people that i know also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now why cant we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality eg all russians are communists all americans are capitalists all germans are nazis all fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries  in my opinion your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you dont seem to be different from the nazis you are talking about  thomas   theres no time to hate barely time to wait jerry garciarobert hunter

   ok it seems that everyone else in canada was treated to the  real abc telecast while only the people on rogers tv in surrey bc  were treated to two channels with don i stink as a commentator whitman doing the playbyplay  the godfather  
   as for the picks ottawa picks 0 which means it is almost 000 that alexander daigle will  go 0 hell either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec  imo i would take kariya  he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in the world championships  daigle didnt show this for his junior team  san jose will then get kariya  tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov i think thats it or a      defenseman rob niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong  the last name is niedermayer as in new jerseys scotts last name because you guessed it they are brothers  but rob niedermayer is a center not a defenseman  i am not sure that the sharks will take kariya  they arent saying much but they apparently like niedermayer and victor kozlov along with kariya  chris prongers name has also been mentioned  my guess is that theyll take niedermayer  they may take pronger except that they already have too many defensive prospects   go calgary flames  al macinnis for norris  gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in edmonton  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu recsporthockey contact for the san jose sharks

  000000 los angeles kings notes  playoffs  stauber disturbed by thirdman theme by rick sadowski daily news  barry melroses decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender  i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most fun time of the year and im not  stauber said with some emotion monday  i think i have worked hard enough for that  stauber said he accepts melroses choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the calgary flames hrudey made 00 saves in sundays 00 opening victory  but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no 0 man behind rick knickle  stauber had a 000 record and 000 goalsagainst average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no 0 job from hrudey  knickle  he won 0 of 0 decisions but had a bloated 000 average twice was  yanked from games once for stomach cramps and hasnt played since march 00  yet when the series resumes wednesday knickle will serve as hrudeys backup again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic saddledome popcorn  if im supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starteri dropped too 0  what happened to no 0  stauber wondered  not that id be happy with no 0 but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs  perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance but melrose apparently is not convinced the 00year old is capable of handling playoff pressure  while insisting he is the kings goalie of the future melrose said stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season  they were according to melrose a 00 loss to san jose on dec 00 an 00 loss to the new york rangers on jan 00 a 00 tie with detroit on feb 00 an 00 loss to  vancouver on thursday  four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could have taken it away from kelly hrudey and he didnt do it melrose said  an elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him  the mark of a great goalie is that he isnt satisfied to be a backup  im not blaming robb for the losses but if youre going to be no 0 youve got to be able to walk your talk  youve got to be able to play when everything is on the line  robb stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe i expect more from him than he does  ouch  that remark stung stauber  he began the season 000 struggled when the team hit a midseason slump didnt play for a month after knickle was signed off the san diego gulls roster then came on at the end  i expect more from myself than anybody including barry melrose said stauber a threeyear star at the university of minnesota who left school in 0000 only  to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries  what ive been through the last four years  two knee operations a herniated disk in my back shoulder surgery  what more can i go through  i obviously do expect a lot from myself otherwise i wouldnt be here  anybody who would disagree with that doesnt know me  im not saying barry  doesnt know me but dont say ive been without expectations  if anything im a perfectionist  stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned but  even though i didnt play well i get knocked down from maybe on to three its  a bit of a jump he said  youre almost no 0 or if you play a good game  youre no 0 and if you dont youre no 0  why does jack nicklaus shoot a 00  and then a 00  can you explain that  thats what barry wanted me to explain  to him why i didnt come through when he counted on me  i dont know what i  do know is its a sport  ill be there  melroses goalie of the future statement doesnt mean much to stauber before you know it ill be 00 and there will be no future he said    game 0 of the kings  flames playoff series drew a 00 nielsen rating on abc  channel 0 here in la  the kings averaged a 00 nielsen rating in the 00 regular season games aired on channel 0  around the nhl  san jose fired coach george kingston who lead the team to a 00000 mark in  their 0nd nhl season  kingston was 000000 over the past 0 years with the sharks    former islander executive bill torrey was named as president of the expansion florida panthers  bobby clarke was named as the clubs general manager  last nights games  win  0  van  0 van leads 00 tor  0  det  0 det leads 00   stan willis willisempirednethaccom net contact la kings          talk with the la kings mailing list  kingscsstanfordedu       to subscribe or unsubscribe  kingsrequestcsstanfordedu

    00min   bill ranford stopped 00 shots to lead canada to a 00 victory in a very well  played game   the first period started with a give away from a canadian defenseman and  rundqvist came in alone on ranford but couldnt put the puck over a sliding  ranford later on kevin dineen had a great opportunity but soderstrom   played very well too stefan nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up  jan larsson but again ranford came up big period ended scoreless but the edge  to sweden in creating more opportunities  second period action saw tommy soderstrom making a great save mark recchi  made a backhanded cross ice pass to lindros eric one timed the puck but  soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save at the 0minute mark canada  started applying pressure on the swedes sandersondineenbrindamour worked  hard and kept the puck in the swedes zone dineen gave the puck to sanderson  who skated around a screened swedish defenseman came in on soderstrom and  made a wrist shot that went it by soderstroms far post 00 canada  the swedes picked up their game after that and peter forsberg had a shot  that hit ranfords post the inside went parallel to the goal line and out  then gartner got a penalty and the swedes a power play jan larsson took  a shot from the slot ranford gave a rebound to larsson who saw juhlin by  the far post passed the puck and ranford was beat 00  third period started as the other periods swedes having most of the pressure  but the canadians always dangerous once they were close to the swede goal  at 000 canada created some great chances and arto blomsten was forced to  cover the puck in the swede goal crease since soderstrom lost sight of it  that resulted in a penalty shot since a defenseman cant cover the puck in   the goal crease geoff sanderson took the penalty shot his first ever he  explained afterwards and he put it low on soderstroms stick side close  to the post excellent penalty shot to give canada a go ahead goal  canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside gartner volleyed a  bouncing puck past soderstrom to make it 00 the swedes ran out of gas  then and couldnt produce as good scoring chances as they had for 00 periods  the 00 goal came with only 0 second left rod brindamour scoring on a  rebound from soderstrom where the swedish defense already had their minds  in the dressing room   a very good game the best in the wc so far with both goalies playing  great soderstrom best player in sweden but ranford even played better  than soderstrom that tells you something about ranford probably the

played well  sanderson naturally game hero with two goals   the forsbergnaslundbergqvist line swedens best along with larssonjuhlin  nilsson swedish defense played well 000 cm 000 kg peter popovic had the  task of neutralizing 000 cm 000 kg eric lindros and managed this very well  ranger defenseman peter andersson finally got to go to the wc and considering  that he landed in germany just a few hours before the game he played very  well swedish coach curt lundmark was irritated after the game partly because  of the swedes inability to score and partly because of the linesmans mistake  on the

   relying on canadian tourists and transplanted northeasterners to support a team in miami is crazy espaecially when you have really deserving  cities without a team such as san diego  milwaukee i wish the panthers or whatever their name is well but if they cant sell to hispanics theyre in deep doodoo already there are rumors that tampa may move to milwaukee  
   i loved the abc coverage the production was excellent the appearance was excellent it had a sleek modern look this was the first time i heard thorne  clement  i thought they were great my only request is to leave al micheals out of this he annoys me  im hoping this leads to a regularseason contract my guess would be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from febapril and then the  playoffs i envy you canadians with your tsn  cbc maybe ill get a dish to pick up canadian tv how much are those things btw  
  first off anyone accepted into the western business school is not a dork  second just because one person out of a country of 00 million doesnt think before heshe posts an article does not mean that heshe is embarrasing canada this network is for expressing what you feel are your thoughts just because someone doesnt agree with you this does not give you the right to call them assholes anyways the north stars are shit   cmon leafs   whoa there  lighten up andrew  when i was referring to you dorks at the western business school i was specifically referring to those assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of minnesota for no apparent reason  being canadian and one who has friends who attended uwo i personally dont want to be associated with the idiots who wrote those messages  one more thing andrewuntil this season the leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen years have they won the cup during our lifetimeso the north stars havent been the only shit team in the norris  kea    
   on tuesday when it was raining in chicago espn provided  bonus hockey coverage  now it seems as though some fans are ticked off that the nywash ot was replaced with the angels game  people must realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the us   the baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so they cant skip the baseball game  why dont you people chill out and enjoy whatever coverage you can get  geoff filinuk

  quebec dominated habs for first 0 periods and only roy kept this one from being rout although he did blow 0nd goal canadians showed up in third but nords were playing dump  pull back most of the time  do you notice that nobody on the team is willing to take charge a dominant defenceman would be nicetoo bad schneider got hurt he reminds me of chris chelios sometimes  speaking of chelios i  wonder if serge savard feels like a moron for making that trade i also wish we still had corson  rob ramage on the ice is less useful than a gatorade bottle on the  bench  vincent damphousse has decided to take a vacation apparently  i have no idea why demers is playing denis savard on the checking line with carbonneau  savard is skating well and is one of the only dangerous canadiens in quebecs zone with the puck  too bad nobody is in front most of the time  do you also notice that in the defensive zone not a single nordique gets knocked down  its disgusting  we also have lebeau 000 000 getting pasted at centre ice by wolaninn 00 000 with no reply from the team except to yell for a penalty  dammit denis savard  threw the best only montreal hit of the night when he knocked sundin offbalance  when denis savard is your teams enforcer theres big trouble someplace  hextall made some good saves but really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 0  could have had 0 plus another 0 in 0nd  aside from that second goal roy did stand on his head  the third  period at least provided something to look forward to  habs won the period imo and i guess somebody finally came along to smack them a couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game had started at 000  hopefully they play that way at home  roy made  the saves well ignore that second goal so now its up to the team    dchhabrastplistsca   ps  to all those grant fuhr doubtersbuffalo 0 boston 0   nuff said  and did somebody say dale hunter was a playoff choker id rethink that position     
     come on boston where the hell are you seven wins in a row and what choke  id much rather see the bruins in the wales conference finals vs pitt than buffalo or quebec if only because it would be more interesting  not that buffalo or quebec cant put up a good fight but id much more enjoy a 00 pasteing of the bruins than the devils  you have to feel for terrerrisp  ah well maybe the devils will pull it out or maybe the pens will lose in the second round but if not i hope the bruins are there to meet them

  lmarshacmsccwayneedu laurie marshall writes  don got his nickname grapes but im not sure  don use to coach the boston bruins  i dont know exactly when that was  could someone fill me in on this info  i think that the name grapes came because as coach for the bruins  or in the minors  he used to chew on grapes to keep from getting  dehydrated during the games  his dog blue may have been named  cause he liked labatts beer  anyone know about that

   so in other words if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out  the penguins thats immaterial because it was the coaches decision come on  joe think about what youre saying who they played is very significant  why they played them is whats irrelevent a low gaa against good teams  is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two  goaltenders a low gaa is better then a higher gaa a low gaa against good  teams is much much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context  of comparing two goaltenders  lets start over  im not arguing about who is the better goaltender  id take soderstrom right now  what i am saying is that roussel can be a 0 netminder  the gaa difference is less than half a goal per game less than that after last night their save percentages are close and their records are similar  and with that i just dont see how you can label roussel as the most disappointing player on the flyers this season  you say soderstrom played against better competition  that may very well be but there is no way of knowing how roussel would have performed in those games  besides against the better scoring teams like pittsburgh the defense is more keyed up than they are against san jose   the same  for roussel in the ranger game two real scoring chances one he made a  great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player if  you were judging roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by  but im not just judging roussel on that game alone  ive seen him play for the past two seasons in philly and before that in hershey  its just my opinion but i think hes got what it takes  of course i thought that about mark laforest too  but i never did about wendell young  so im batting 000 in judging hershey talent since the hextallera  as for the rangers game you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like  but rou had his leg in position to make the save  if he didnt it wouldnt have mattered if the rangers player didnt get the puck up or not  it would have been a goal  on a breakaway thats what the goalie wants to do take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him   but if you were to look at the 00 tie against the habs you saw a goalie  stand on his head to get that shutout that was a 0 goalie in action roussel  doesnt have a game like that in him  i seem to remember roussel doing an excellent job against pittsurgh on opening night to give the flyers a tie against the twotime defending champs  and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the habs  but you cant tell me that a montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it  mistakes both on offense and defense are part of the game  or thered never be shutouts  anyway im happy the flyers have both soderstrom and roussel and im not going to argue about it anymore  besides with the current 0game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year i dont want to piss you off to the point that you dont sell me any tickets next season                                             joe dakes                                  att microelectronics                       000 union boulevard                           allentown pa  00000                     lets go flyers  alux0jmd                                       jmdaluxpoattcom                                                                                  
   tom barrasso wore a great mask one time last season  he unveiled it at a game in boston    it was all black with pgh city scenes on it  the golden triangle pghs downtown area where the 0 rivers meet graced the top along with a steel mill on one side and the civic arena i think on the  other   on the back of the helmet was the old pens logo the really fat little penguin with the blue scarf the current at the time pens logo and a space for the new now current logo  tommy had designed the mask and his mother an artist painted it for him    but while wearing the mask the pens got thumped by the bruins  the very next game tommy was back to the old paint job  a great mask done in by a goalies superstition  lori

   after reading some of the reports of possible nhl moves to milwaukee or that milwaukee should have an nhl team i thought id pass along a story i heard recently  this is second hand so i dont know how true it is but i have no reason to doubt it either  bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge hockey team  the owner of the admirals sorry i cant remember his name either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the bradley center  supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise but  turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of 00 million was too high  like i said i dont know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if its true dont look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon  the admirals arent going to be forced out of the building and you wont see an nhl club and a minor league club in the same building especially since the nbas milwaukee bucks play there as well  charlie betz cray research inc   chippewa falls wi cbetzromuluscraycom

  yes yes i can see it now  all those sabre fans finally taking their sabre sweaters out of the moth balls and proudly wearing them after 0 years of playoff frustration and being up 0 games to nil i guess it is a pretty good bet    but there has not been a team that has come back from an 00 deficit since 0000  could this be the year   dont throw out the moth balls yet  roy  
  i wrote  i feel the jury is still out on tim cheveldae as a playoff goalie he was average in his first playoffs  last year he had a horrible start but played great the last ten games after he was benched his gaa even with the horrible start was 00 last year  this year i think hes going to play very well he has to if detroit is going to win the cup  he wasnt sharp in game 0 but he didnt have to be i thought he looked pretty good yesterday  charles hubbert writes great write up of the wingstoronto series thus far  i agree with just about everything that you said but chevy shouldnt have let the shot from the right point in  first goal mikorov i think  other than that the wings are looking good and chevy is holding his own  not great but maybe  chevy has let in 0 or 0 soft goals so far but they all didnt matter however his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up big when it counts  the score was 00 i think when the goal you mentioned was scored  in the third period when it looked like toronto was coming back chevy was exceptional  i can see him as a barraso style playoff goalie  inconsistant when theres nothing on the line but comes up big when really needed  i guess well both find out  ron   and one of my major goals is to leave the next president a new set of things to worry about  im getting bored reading the same problems in the paper decade after decade  i want people to have to deal with new problems                      president bill clinton   0000  
  susan clark asks hi guys         im looking to answe a bit of trivia  what hockeplayers have appeared on major talk shows on tv ie letterman carsonleno arsenio etcie shows of a national natureinclude canadian equivalents if you can think of any  this can include nhl olympic and world champion ship players  im pretty sure ive seen gretzky and lemieux but i was wondering if there were any others   i am not so sure about the celebrated players of the game but tod hartje who played for harvard in college and then went on to play in the ahl initially for moncton and currently for providence thanks to daryl  turner for the update appeared on david lettermans show about two years ago now  tod has the distinction of being the first american born player to go  and play in the former soviet union this was arranged by jets gm mike  smith while tod was playing in moncton at about the time all those  european players were coming over to north america to play in the nhl  tod spent a year playing in russia and played with or against some of the russian players who have just entered the nhl in the last two years he wrote a book on his experiences called behind the red line check it out and appeared on the letterman show to talk about them   mike   note i hope i have my facts straight it has been a year since i read tods book i wanted to dig the book out to double check but  realized i lent it to a friend and he hasnt returned the book yet  just wait til i get a hold of him  
  david vergolini wrote   did anyone see the montreal  quebec game yesterday  it was tight right down to the last second of the third period  in the overtime roy and hextall played like they were gods ok so montreal won  they deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick  their second goal in overtime was also replayed but i could not tell if it was the montreal player who kicked it in  the puck definitely was not directed in by a stick anyways montreal is back into the series    the overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the quebec  defender who deflected the puck  the replay officials did not  take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first  nongoal so it seemed pretty noncontroversial  i agree that it was a great game good to see roy and damphousse back into form  hopefully the sign of good things to come  paul valin                                     tel  0 000 000 0000 bellnorthern research ltd                    email pavalinbnrca po box 0000 station c ottawa ontario canada k0y 0h0               only my opinions  
  during the first three games of the pensdevils series i have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the pens  jagr maceachern and barrasso have been especially fun to watch  but one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be scotty bowman  despite brooks lunatic comments and despite the devils line changing adantage in last nights game bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the devils in the dark  granted the helldwellers had the pens bottled up for a while last night but bowman was eventually able to configure his lineup to get the job done  his ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible  bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis  last night for instance he realized that the speed of jagr straka and maceachern was throwing the devils off balance  as a result straka received many more shifts than average jagr played almost the entire game he was always on the puck and maceachern scored a goal while complementing jagr many times throughout the night his ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate and to bring about success  while no one can replace the genius and optimism of badger bob johnson bowman in his own way has made himself a permanent though not clearly seen mark in  pittsburgh   
  i really feel the need for a knowledgable hockey observer to explain this years playoffs to me i mean the obviously superior toronto team with the best center and the best goalie in the league keeps losing what gives               i stand by all the misstatements that ive made  vice president dan quayle to sam donaldson 00000  me too  nick duncan duncanmprgatemprca

  dino getting shots in front of the net he should expect it  this is playoff hockey where anything goes you lose one game in the regular season and its not so bad you lose a game in the playoffs and its a difficult thing to overcome  ive watched hockey and played it too for a number of years and i havent seen one postseason game where the forward in front of the net  has not finished without any bruises on the back of his leg  the leafs are  not doing a good job in clearing the net and potvin has been forced to take matters into his own hands  i remember when cicarelli used to play for the london knights ohl he always was a nuisance in front of the net and the  goalies took exception to this  he also complained in this mornings paper about what happened last night but to me its a lot of bellyaching his  team is up 00 and he complains about being whackedi wonder what would happen if he tried to do the same thing in front of billy smith or a younger ron hextall seems dino would need two artifical legs  dino should take it  as part of the game and thank his lucky stars that hes in the playoffs and has a good chance to go the finals   well i agree that if youre going to stand in front of the net that you should expect to get hit and hacked at in general you should expect to finish the game with some bruises however there is a fine line between hacking at a guy causing some pain and discomfort and blatantly attempting to injure another player felix potvin imo crossed that line on wednesday that two hander on ciccarelli was way out of line i lost a lot of respect for potvin because of that it showed an immaturity he did not slash at ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area a legal position for dino to be in instead he slashed in an attempt to injure it was out of shear frustration as a leaf supporter just a supporter im not a leaf fan really i was very disappointed  youre right in mentioning billy smith and ron hextall at least in his philly days they both crossed that same line at times and for that reason many fans and players disliked them thats why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues lets hope that felix doesnt do that again id hate to see anyone even dino  although i admit i dont like him very much get seriously hurt from such careless but intentional use of the stick  gary

    gballentvancouveruvicca greg  ballentine writes  lots of debate about the virtues of bryan murray vs pat quinn as a gm deleted  randy graca seems to think murray is the best gm in the league i think quinn is one of several who are better  plus his team quinns has improved a much greater amount than detroit since he took over with them  how do you figure  both vancouver and detroit did the same thing last year they both won their division they had close to the same number of points they both went down 00 in the first round of the playoffs before finally escaping in 0 games and they both got knocked out in the second round by teams they should have been able to beat with less talent  specifically if i remember correctly third place teams  how does this make vancouver more improved  further if im not mistaken the wings had more points than vancouver at the end of this season albeit not many   when quinn took over vancouver several years ago not last year they  regularily missed the playoffs  i cant recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did  quinn has improved the team from nonplayoff calibre to a serious contender  when murray took over in detroit the were about a 000 team that was a contender to win the norris division and possibly even a stanley cup contender  so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over as a gm quinn is one example of a better gm than murray  gregmeister

  amongst penguins fans there seems to be an inner calm that ive never experienced before this year with the pens the players and the fans have so much confidence in the team this year were savoring every game and saving our energy for the stanley cup  thats not inner calm  its boredom and its being spoiled  the arenas been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just take winning for granted  its been seemingly forever since the team lost and weve forgotten what its like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory  while im glad to have the pens doing so well in some ways it was a better high back when the pens beat the bruins two years ago and the rangers last year too much of a good thing is not always good for you  rick

  heres one from the mill  the oilers might move to hamilton where porklington can get a free deal   the probability is that the oilers are not going anywhere  pocklington has chosen this moment to make his last stand is because he is at the moment of maximum advantagethe provincial government is months away from a provincial electionit is the moment when he has maximum power to convince northlands to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price and it is before the nhls new collective agreement with the players which might involve some enhanced revenuesharing  pocklington is many thingsstupid is not one of them  he can dictate termsbecause other cities will pay his price if edmonton doesnt  edmonton has already fucked up its international airport and surrendered supremacy to calgary and over the next few years edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks it will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find a way to lose its hockey team toobecause northlands wants to continue to use the oilers to subsidize horse racing  however in this case about the longterm financial viability of the oilers the fact is that pocklington is basically  right regardless of who owns the team and it is right to provoke the crisis now before the team accumulates millions of dollars in losses or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack of money  sather has done his jobthe oilers are poised to be competitive again very soon al strachan one of the most knowledgeble hockey writers in canada in a postmortem of the oilers season in the globe and mail recently agrees with me  gerald

       the tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules  overtime time games     that are not shown  what the hell kind of shit is this  if that would     have happened to the flyersif they were in the damn playoffs to begin     with while i was watching i would have gone throught the roof      however everybody is getting pissed off at espn but they are not the     ones to blame  they have prior contracts that they just cant simply break     whenever they want to  the nhl is to blame  when they signed the     deal with espn they had to know of this  they had to know shit like this     would happen since they wouldnt have complete priority  the nhl     should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at espn  how can the     nhl do this to its fans how dare they  we are the ones that make the     damn league exist and they cant even televise complete playoff games for us to     watch  they more i write about this the more pissed off i get  we must     let the nhl know that  we expect a little better than this  if anybody     out there knows how to go about doing this let me and everybody else know      well i had to get that off my chest and while im at it      mario is the michael jordan of hockey  all that fucker has to do is fall     on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 0  last night in the     0rd game between nj and pitt he was being pushed while skating across the     front of the goal while trying to get a shot off  the guy on him was     doing a good job so he got off a weak shot but then he decided to fall     to the ice then the fucking refvan helloamend called the guy for     holding  they replayed the play and my roomatewho is clueless about     hockey wanted to know what the nj guy did to get a call because it was so fucking obvious the nj player     had both hands on his stick and no he did not trip him  it is simple     mario gets touched he falls to the ice automatic 0  but the thing that     really pissed me off is pitt scored the 0rd or 0th goal i dont remember     on the resulting pp and     eventually won 00  his divingcalls makes a huge difference in the     outcome of a game      they gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking     obvious that is not hockey  it allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players and allows inferior teams to beat better ones this has pissed me off for many years now and it has improved somewhat however during the playoffs and 0rd periods the damn refs must misplace their balls because they sure dont make any calls that show that they got any      all agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed      steve        
   there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans  i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages  i think a compromise would work namely honouring personages in  conference names and using geographical references in the divisional  names  although i still do not think the move will draw fans to the game imo its a cosmetic change that bettman and the owners hope  will have an effect  and it doesnt say much for the mentality of  anybody it works on either    another thing that bothers me is the points system  percentages as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative  when i look at the nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand which is almost always the case  some will object to percentages claiming perhaps that it is an americanization of the sport  surprise i agree totally  the points system is fine if everybody at all times has played the same number of games  since this is almost never the case winning percentage is the way to go  i dont particularly care if it  is an american thing either if it works      dchhabrastplistsca  
  bleep bleep bleep  the bruins lost again in ot  i cant stand it  aside from frustrated ravings i must give buffalo credit they are making good  on most of their scoring opportunities and are playing great defense  boston players cant seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the buffalo net except for on rare occasions  the buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds  fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but hes also getting plenty of help boston has been playing rather well better than would be indicated by the  series score of 00 but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the  game  as a result boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 0st period 0 goals down  this must stop if boston is to have any hope of winning a single game the outlook for the bruins advancement to the second round are quite bleak  imho the bruins need to score first  if they can do that they have an excellent chance of winning since they have outplayed the sabres in the  0nd and 0rd periods  the scary thing is that ill be going to grad school in buffalo next year    ill never cheer for the sabres you cant convert me    mtm0   mike mosscrop    die hard bruins fan dept of chemistry umasslowell mosscropmwoodsulowelledu

   wow this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team boston which sweeney you askwell of course bob sweeney the one that boston let buffalo get a hold of they still have 0 sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing  game winner in ot in game 0 and another big goal seconds after fuhr made 0 point blank saves  this is why grant has 0 rings to put buffalo ahead in the 0rd  yes neely countered a minute later but hadnt this course of buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities i think boston would have notched their first win of the series  well the sabres havent made it to the end of this series yet but i certainly feel theyve got boston right were they want themactually theyve got them in a position that neither buffalo nor boston felt that would come about  one more astronomical game by fuhr a few more heroics by the rest of the team this is a team sport afterall and i think borque neely jouneau sp and company are gonna be swinging a new stick weather is perfect for golf season real soon  im not gonna waiger anything on this because ive seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey  talking about golfwas that a hockey swing golf swing or baseball swing that hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that khmylev deflected in for the big one  the whole ot all 0 minute of it was a tesiment to buffalos ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end something they werent necessarily in the regular season  the sabres pushed hard and forced borque to blatently take down bodger in the opening seconds  i dont normally like penalties being called in such ultracritical points but this was blatent  finally the sabres won a faceoff they werent that hot in this dept the rest of the game when lafontaine scooped at the puck 0 times  when hawerchuck took his shot quite a boomer but blue stopped this one he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again without setting it up  i didnt realize it went in until the announcer started screaming they score they score  the best was seeing lafontaine jumping up and down skating a little bit jumping some more and then skating over to brad may who he jumped on  doug mckee mckeecsbuffaloedu

  according to the hockey gurus over at espn should the islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record but the devils will be playing the penguins  this is because the islanders have won the season series against the devils  i think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include  0  season series 0  goals against 0  goals for  in this order correct me if im wrong  anyone have anything to add  craig  go islanders   
  djaraczozplymouthedu  writes  in article 00000000000dlmqccunyvmbitnet harold zazula dlmqccunyvmbitnet writes  i was watching the detroitminnesota game last night and thought i saw an  octopus on the ice after ysebaert scored to tie the game at two what gives    no no no  its a squid  keep the tradition alive  kinda like the  fish at unh games   actually the way i understand it it is an octapus apparently a number of years ago a fan threw an octapus on the ice and the announcer said octapi will not occupy the ice or something like that and its happened ever since  the fans cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands and boo those who use a shovel  matt at uva  
  if the islanders beat the devils tonight they would finish with identical records  whos the lucky team that gets to face the penguins in the opening round   also can somebody list the rules for breaking ties i am not sure about the tie breaker rules however i think if the islanders win oh god please please let them win the islanders win the series against  nj and advances to third   of course no one asked me i always interject my opinions on maters i have no concern over  go islanders i mean come on the jets were bad enough go jets for 00  
    in response to a debate about who has has a better season jagr of francis  i think jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time stats dont exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better      actually what i think has become more evident is that you are determined to   flaunt your ignorance at all cost  jagr did not have a better season than   francis  to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of   hockey knowledge  save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty   plusminus  it is the most misleading hockey stat available    until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice   time per game and some measure of its quality ie is the player put out   in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up   against the other teams top one or two lines shorthanded etc i would   much rather see the  disappear altogether instead of having its dubious   merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications   is a useful statistic  if a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals he must be doing something right it is especially useful to compare between teammates as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar  ratings if they are equally good players  it can be adjusted with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams  i agree it would be nice for the nhl to keep more statistics but how useful are the ones that you suggest  total ice time would be very useful it is a missing stat in jagr vs francis arguments from before  somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless  it would be a better stat for evaluating coaching ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones  a very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who doesnt recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player  this stat would be much more flawed than  and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent   is a useful stat  it is quite useful in evaluating player talent you are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing and should be evaluated as such  gregmeister  
   so if potvin can pound on dino what happens when dino pounds  on him  if dino gets his legs slashed can he slash potvin in return  this year at a umlssu hockey game a um player was called for a slash when he hit the goalies glove with his stick  is that slashing while hitting someones ankles isnt  how do the refs know what to call  do the goalies get more liberties than other players   brad

  what sadist brought up this vein about malarchuk  when i saw what happened i wanted to throw up and at the same time i was devastated since i thought that malarchuk wouldnt survive  btw i believe he picked up an alcohol problem after before the incident  to radically change the subject the caps must be having nightmares about the isles in overtime in the playoffs  have they ever beaten the islanders in a playoff ot game  this is lunacy  the caps are such a sorry team in the playoffs they consistently choke against opponents who they should be beating  losing two ot games in a row is not coincidence its evidence of the choke factor       keith kellerlets go rangers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs      in this cornerlets go quakers      weighing in at almost every weight imaginable          life and all that surrounds it      blues traveler 0000

       mario is the michael jordan of hockey  all that fucker has to do is fall     on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 0  last night in the     0rd game between nj and pitt he was being pushed while skating across the     front of the goal while trying to get a shot off  the guy on him was     doing a good job so he got off a weak shot but then he decided to fall     to the ice then the fucking refvan helloamend called the guy for     holding  they replayed the play and my roomatewho is clueless about     hockey wanted to know what the nj guy did to get a call because it was so fucking obvious the nj player     had both hands on his stick and no he did not trip him  it is simple     mario gets touched he falls to the ice automatic 0  but the thing that     really pissed me off is pitt scored the 0rd or 0th goal i dont remember     on the resulting pp and     eventually won 00  his divingcalls makes a huge difference in the     outcome of a game      all agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed      steve      we must have been watching two different games   the devil had one hand on marios elbow and pulling the elbow caused mario to fall so the call was appropriate  using clueless people to substantiate your claims doesnt give me a lot of confidence in your call either  next time consider getting a second opinion from a clueful observer  or maybe all those available disagreed        joseph stiehm

  drozinstdberauedu drozinski tim writes  as if an aluminum stick being taken to ulfs head is gonna solve the problem with violence in the sport of hockey  how the hell can you say the guy is a goon and justify it with your backassward mentality  saying that hurting a player will solve anyones problems is asinine  new rules and a new  referee system need to be instituted  right now too many of the real goons get away with too much because the ref is watching the play or supposed to beive seen koharski and van hellemond to name a few with their heads up their  asses on a few calls rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the  play  even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties it would be an improvement  unfortunately that is the way the league is heading you cant fight so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref isnt looking ulf has brought this to a high level players stuck in the past like neely who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system  lets face it a cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective method it is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way i dont like it but thats the way the league is going  by the way there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguindevil game managed to hit the nj player in the face with a stick must have been a legal hit after all ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do things like that   
   i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference next week while the exact details are not known it is believed to concern the oilers future  rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with copps collesium in hamilton during the press conference pocklington may announce the deal it is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium  northlands has offered to buy the oilers for 00 million earlier but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington  as for me my opinion is divided edmonton has been fairly supportive of the oilers even though theyre a small market team they had many sellouts in the 00s even with the problems that the team had this year they still brought in more fans than many teams in larger cities did on the other hand if the team does move there is no place more deserving than hamilton of course how would that affect the grand realignment scheme of bettman

  i watched the game germanyczechs in wc todayand i was astonished about the behaviour of the german audience the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went grazy they threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis that stupid or what i guess the canadian referee one of the isostarbros  gave the german team a penalty for that but it didnt help much i guess the germans just are proud over their nazikillemalleveryone butusgermanssucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude in every possible sport remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer it really pisses me off i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks but  most of them seem to do  jokke kylmaoja golfphoenixoulufi

  from dean in other tv news the penguins announced yesterday that they will have 0 fewer broadcast tv games and will have 00 games on some sort of subscription  payperview system yuck   this is incorrect  this year the pens had 00 games on free tv and 0 games on ppv  next year they will have 00 games on free tv and 00 on  a subscription basis     you actually get 0 more free game than last year and there will be no more radioonly games  yes youre right after going home and reading the paper i got the full details thats what i get for making a post based on wduqs news i should know by now they get just about every sports related item wrong  ralph   
        as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and doesnt know anything about him i dont know whether it is just this area pittsburgh of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether hes a canadian thing altogether  seriously what is he all about  i know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question is what is the deal with him  secondly are the comments of his that i read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him seriously  i gotta tell you from what i see he really sounds like an ass  let me know  maybe im missing something   
   i loved the abc coverage the production was excellent the appearance antonioyou werent alone  abc ratings were very good i was schocked to hear that abcs telecast was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend national rating came out to a very respectable 00 top00 nielsen markets were at 00 in bostonthe game scored lower at 00 but it had some competion from local sports teams quite frankly i expected abcs ratings to be under 00 but im happy to be proven wrong  wellwellsometimes it pays off clicking away on your cabletv remote control and if you happen to be a hockey fanyou could just stumble upon a playoff hockey game  espn picked up detroittoronto game on monday night because the only night game in mlb was being rained out in chicago you have to give espn credit for switching to detroits fox00 coverage and having bill clement at a pittsburghs tv stationwate for intermission analysis maybeespn people were giddy over perliminary overnight abc ratings for sundays telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion good moveespn   ppv mark

  showing a meaningless relatively baseball game over the overtime of game that was tied up with less than 0 seconds left on the clock gimme a break  where does espn get these brilliant decisions from   its called contractual obligations with major league baseball i wouldve liked to see the ot of the islescaps game but i understand where espn is coming from espn is committed to a single telecast a night and everything after that is a bonus  ppv mark

   its true that vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before  quinn came but in those years the smythe division was a loti mean a lot tougher division than the norris also known as the snorris division vancouver had to play edmonton and calgary both very legitimate stanley cup contenders eight times a year while detroit got to play such  powerhouses as toronto and minnesota  now edmonton is hardly even a force in the league and the smythe even has the mighty san jose sharks while  them thars fighting wordshardly a forcegeezmiss the playoffs once in 00 years and even after making the final four 0 times in the last five years and everyone thinks its doomsville  over this same period of time in which vancouver was improving so was  everybody in the norris except st louis  detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division  they had to improve a lot to get better than their competition in the norris  bryan murray inherited a team with very little talent  for really good players they had yzerman burr and probert and that was about it  and no doubt some will dispute whether burr and probert were that good the rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans  the only reason they got as far as they did in the years before murray came was due to the coaching of demers who at least at first got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team  then even his coaching began to degrade   fedorov primeau kozlov lidstrom sillinger konstantinov drake kennedy racine and cheveldae were already in the pipeline due to devellanomurray inherited these guysin addition to yzerman probert carson chiasson etc  there are a number of reasons why detroit wasnt in as bad a shape standings wise when murray took over as vanc was when quinn took over some of which i outlined above but murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did quinn with the exception of yzerman  and one player cannot alone make a team into a stanley cup contender as im sure everyone reading this will agree     noquinn had far lessmurray took over detroit at a time to  take advantage of all of devellanos good draftingif devellano had not given in to demers request to make the oates trade he might still be gm  gerald

  it was great to hear that umass is bringing back hockey  it reminded me that a couple of years ago there was talk that both bimidgi sp and mankato state trying to upgrade their programs to div 0 status  i also seem to remember that they had some trouble with new ncaa rule about just who was allowed to compete at the div 0 level  was that ever resolved  also i was just wondering if there is any college hockey east of colorado alaska excepted with the new popularity of hockey on the west coast i would expect there to be some interest building at the collegiate levels too anyone heard anything                       james old email joldvmaccndedu  
      tonight in boston the buffalo sabres blanked the boston bruins 00 tonight in boston looks like boston can hang this season up because buffalos home record is awesome this is great buffalo fans might get to see revenge for last year   im glad grant fuhr will never be as overconfident after two wins as you areit takes four wins to defeat an opponenteach tougher to obtain than the previous one  buffalo is off to a good start fuhr is proving the fuhrbashers wrong but boston is an awfully good team  gerald   
  could anyone post the game summary for the sabresbruins game  grant fuhr rules   gerald  
  in article lte00kinn0ulappservengsuncom mretealengsuncom mike eisler writes i dont think trading kisio was intrinsically a mistake however trading him for a 0rd round pick would be he should have been worth a lot more than a 0rd round pick for a playoff team  in fact i would intimate that the offers the sharks got this year for kisio were way greater than just a 0rd round pick  hindsights 0000 nobody expected kisio to have his 0nd best career year  besides without kisio the sharks would have tanked even earlier in the season and gund might have gotten a little more serious about getting joe murphy a guy who definitely would be around 0  0 years from now when the sharks do make the playoffs  what else could be done  the gunds offered 0 million for murphy but the oilers wanted prospects which the sharks declined to give which i think is correct  i didnt mean to imply that gunds offer wasnt enough  gunds offer was the right  but too late in the season  0m offered in november lets sather buy a replacement for murphy this season and make the playoffs this year 0m in march doesnt help sather with his immediate objectives doesnt help with long term objectives only a prospect or draft pick does and no way should the sharks do that however getting back to whatif games had kisio been traded to chicago last year then the sharks go 0 for october and maybe gund panicks sooner in november and heres another whatif twist chicago would have had kisio this season they never go after murphy in the first place because kelly is having his best season bigger guys in chicago so gund has no competition so ferriera sather and keenan all look like geniuses  a broken fax machine and ferriera keenan and maybe kingston and maybe even green lose their jobs kind of makes you shiver doesnt it   bottomline for every black scenario any of you can concoct for kisio leaving i can concoct an equally bright one  if the kisiofiasco was the cause of ferierras down fall i hope it wasnt because he tried to trade kisio but because he screwed it up nonetheless im sorry ferierra and kingston are gone and i wish gund would follow  and what have the gunds done exactly that caused you to wish that they were gone   are you serious  let ferierra go  fire kingston these last two basically mean that sharks are starting over again in terms of the timetable to capture the cup as ive stated frequently 0 out 0 expansion teams had the same gm from inception through cup season   broadcast more home games than away games  broadcast very few road pacific and mountain time games  jack up my ticket prices from 00 to 00 in two years not that im going to pay 000 bucks for 0 seats ill probably next to the virtual 000 folks   not tell me my priority   not let me sell my priority   in order for me to get the free jacket force me to order my tickets for next season before i get to select my section   not let me park at the new arena after paying for their privileged parking lot which was sometimes full when i got there for 0 straight years  ive been a loyal ticket holder since day 0 literally in spring of 00 when the team was announced  and im not getting that loyalty returned wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison and pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all  go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in edmonton  i know one isnt suppose to make negative comments on signatures but what did us oiler fans do to you to deserve the stay in edmonton part id never wish the kings to leave metrola its too much fun watching the sharks beat them   mike eisler mreengsuncom  not only are they leafs the best team but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburghs  their  players are mighty bright too  i mean he really was going to get his  wallet back right jan brittenson 000 on leafpen woofers in  recsporthockey

   i knew despite the lack of a full game telecast last week it was still too much hockey for atlanta atlantas abc has declined to pick up any playoff games till may0 and even when they show the games on may0 and may00 they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast i know this is still a better situation compared to rest of georgia alabama etc but it is still pretty annoying at least in pittsburgh we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate   i asked them what their problem was i told them that a local 00 rating was not that bad considering it was the first nhl game shown after a long time without much promotion besides their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated so what did they have to lose by showing nhl playoffs she told me that they had contractual obligations i asked her if golf was shown oin abc would contractual obligations come in the way and how come contractual obligations didnt come in the way of last weeks telecast she then couldnt give me a coherent answer   also i added that atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game attendances and that the demographics were good i think abc and other networks should begin to tie their high rated programs like roseanne in with  thier sports programming i hope that everyone in atlanta who reads this bboard calls wsb 0 and complain bitterlyt about this tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation  the lady did not seem to settle on a single reason sometimes the reason is low ratings then another time she says contractual obligations  
   while watching the penguinsdevils game last night i saw the slash that barrasso took on the neck  this brought to mind the goaltender who had his jugular vein cut by a skate  i think he was a sabre but im not positive does anyone rememberknow his name  what has happened to him since  what about the player whose skate cut the goalie  name  info  has this ever happened before in a hockey game     thanks  carol go pens  his name is clint malarchuk  im not sure what he does now but ive heard hes an extra in slasher films  brian   
    ok i know i look pretty desperate on this bboard i think i have posted 0 or 0 messages already on the issue of nhl telecats over the last few weeks but hey i am pretty desperate what i am interested is not just a sportsbar with multiple screens so thast i can watch the game on one of those silent screens are there any hockey oriented bars in this area or does some patrick division or adams division fan have a satellite dish i dont mind paying an admission fee if necessary  
        as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and doesnt know anything about him i dont know whether it is just this area pittsburgh of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether hes a canadian thing altogether  seriously what is he all about  i know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question is what is the deal with him  secondly are the comments of his that i read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him seriously  i gotta tell you from what i see he really sounds like an ass  let me know  maybe im missing something   for those of you who complain about don cherry and wonder why he is popular  the reply is dick vitale and john madden and bobby knight and joe garagiola and howard cosell  john madden picks gary clark of the redskins for his allmadden team a lot over much better receiversfor much the same reasons cherry sings the praises of doug gilmoura little guy with heartyet one doesnt see a string of american posts saying that john madden has lost his marbles  dick vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or that college with outrageous statements  why should americans expect that canada would not have such characters in relation to our greatest passionwhich is hockey   canadians are very similar to americansculturally our sports are just hockey and curling whereas with americans it is footballbasketballbaseball and bowling  gerald  
  however bowman is really not a modern coach and patricks solution of having him only run the team on game days and delegate most of the daytoday responsibity to the assistants is a shrewd managerial decision on patricks part    i would argue gerald that bowman is the first modern coach bowmans canadiens were the first nhl team to have a weightroom in the 00s  he is the first coach i have seen that manipulates the press into spreading false game plan rumours  during important games listen to the pregame interview will bowman and compare that to what is on the ice  i agree bowman is a master of the lineups  remember last year in the sc when he benched jagr only to set him free  in ot  when jagr banged in the winning goal i thought this was trademark bowman and also a sign of a modern coach  i am left asking what is a modern coach if not bowman  jake   
   paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the nhl we was robbed  no  patrick roy is the reason the game was lost and ron hextall is the reason quebec won   i dont buy this at all roy was the reason the game was tied and that would not have been the case had dionne kept his cool  roy stood on his  head for the first 00 minutes of the game when the nords were rushing from  endtoend kamenskys minibreak after the tying goal and the first shot by  young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy roy outplayed  hextall for most of the game but roy becomes the villain and hextall  the hero because roys team didnt make full use of their opportunities  whoa  what you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well he stores up mistakes that can be used at a later time  ths is not so  roy is the villain as you so succinctly put it because he allowed a very cheap goal  if you think roy outplayed hextall perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first 00 minutes of the third period  nhl goaltenders make some great saves  if they did not they would not be in the nhl in the first place  i do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time even though they are occasionally required  however when it comes to a routine shot like sakics especially at such a crucial time in a game i dont think there  are any legitimate excuses   hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces  description of lucky bounces hextall wasnt particularly brilliant on those plays    i am not arguing that hextall was brilliant  i am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result  in a goal     but it was just the 0 goal the timing stank but against an explosive team like quebec they gave them 0 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary  in a onegoal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as just the 0 goal  i have not defended dionne for taking the penalty eitherin fact i think it was a boneheaded move  but it led to one goal only and montreal had a two goal lead  my main concern is the second  goal  this most certainly was a team loss leclair missed his opportunities as did bellows and brunet dionne took a bad penalty damphousse and lebeau were silent carbonneau and savard were a step behind all night roy gave up the bad goal roy by no means can be singled out for this loss  what you say about the skaters is absolutely true  but realize that the  game was effectively won  you could watch any hockey game in fact you could watch any sporting event period and spend hours discussing the what ifs wrt missed opportunities  they are not important when the final result is decided  if i get the time soon ill watch the game again and email you a list of lucky montreal bounces and a list of quebec offensive screwups  montreal was leading with a minute to go  the goalie is the last line of defence and i will grant that extra attention is focussed on him sometimes without justification  but roy gave up a lousy goal and a team cannot afford such a goal  roy looked like a player in an industrial league on sakics shot  and hextall didnt on dionnes goal please   who cares  of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play  i could do a hextall critique if youd like  but if youre going to assess his performance keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times  roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies  and he still is in the top 0  for the record i did not say that roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league  in fact i agree that he is  the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the habs they are no better than uninformed fans                              i assume you are referring to me  however i have pointed out that i think the loss can be blamed on roy  i have not said he sucks nor do i think ive made any other derogatory comments  if you regard objective and informed fyi observations as derogatory i really cant help you    dchhabrastplistsca    
  vergolini writes   ok buffalo fans  i am a red wings fan but am amazed at how the sabres are beating up on the bruins  is there any reason for this  is it grant fuhr or mogilny and lafontaine  i would like to hear from you since i do not know much about the sabres                                                      dave vergolini                                                 michigan state university                                                 vergolineulerlbsmsuedu  pure and simple grant fuhr is money  he has been awesome in the playoffs especially last night  but mogilny has been scoring well and his russian friend kymlev sp has also done well  but fuhr is the biggest reason they are winning and the difference between this years team and previous years  bill perry   
  allan sullivan allancsualbertaca wrote   unfortunately that is the way the league is heading you cant fight  so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when  the ref isnt looking ulf has brought this to a high level players  stuck in the past like neely who prefer fights to cheap shots  are at a disadvantage in the new system   lets face it a cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective  method it is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of  causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way i dont  like it but thats the way the league is going   by the way there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguindevil  game managed to hit the nj player in the face with a stick must have been a  legal hit after all ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do  things like that  are there any ex nhl hockey players out there who might care to comment on this and end this ridiculously long discussion    tom huot                huotcraycom

  get off espns back and stop posting articles on this subject there have been to many fn complainers about this game that its making me sick  generally i agree with you however 0 last night espn cut away to baseball tonite which looks like sportscenter tailored to baseball and they cut away at 000 pacific thats quite a contract they have there 0 if espn couldnt deliver they should have had a transistion plan to let sportschannel pick up the slack  nonetheless it is ultimately the fault of the usamerican public that regular season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the us support your team support your game  somebody in rsh had an excellent idea that we should write chrysler to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would consider their products heres an equally excellent idea watch baseball for 00 minutes i know im asking a lot but thats what spew bags are for write down who is advertising and write them letters complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and that you wont consider buying their products because of it   mike eisler mreengsuncom  not only are they leafs the best team but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburghs  their  players are mighty bright too  i mean he really was going to get his  wallet back right jan brittenson 000 on leafpen woofers in  recsporthockey  
    the goalie to whom you refer is clint malarchuk  he was at that time playing with the sabres  his team immediately prior to that was the washington capitals  while he did recover and continue to play i do not know his present whereabouts  
  just some thoughts  i dont usually like to post simply to make fun of a player but this time i couldnt resist  during the pensdevils game last night second period i think kevin stevens was in the penalty box nicholls punched kjell samuellson in the face then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself  all kjell could do at 00 and 000 pounds was laugh  and speaking of swedish penguins defensemen ulf is getting a little out of hand lately  his cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent  as everybody in the meadowlands except for the officials could see last night he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the devils throat  ive always supported the argument he does his job by being irritating but hes starting to push it over the edge imho  of course holiks chop to barrassos neck wasnt too sportsmanlike either it seems that he was following the the only way to beat the penguins is to injure them philosophy  as my modern drama professor pointed out to me the other day jagr was stoned pretty well tuesday night and last night as well although the 00 seconds he danced around the devils end was pretty exciting  matt at uva  
  mom writes i fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team left in pittsburgh will be the steelers  perish the thoughtbut you know you may be right at least as far as major league professional sports teams go  they all seem to be becoming big money games much more so than at any previous time  to think that if i am ever able to move back home several years from now all that may be there is an ahl team at bestsigh  the interesting thing is that the nhl is also expanding at the same time as it is dramatically increasing the amount of money needed to operate a team  this would seem to indicate that theres a big shakeout about to occur in the next few years unless player salaries can somehow be brought under control  frankly i dont see how the nhls current drive for expansion is supportable under its current operating conditions  if revenue sharing and a salary cap dont come into the nhl soon look out steve  
  i hadnt heard about this new espn0 when is this new network supposed to start sounds great to me as long as my cable co  offers it   hopefully epsn will use the lesson given by the master ted turner the season ted introduced tnt many cable cos refused to put it on saying that gee we get enough old movies miniseries etc on tbs usa amc wgn wor why do we need another one this was in the fall come spring ted fixed their little red wagons good the previous spring nba playoffs wore on tbs now they were on tnt and still are and everyone gets tnt now  so espn should put nfl football and baseball on espn0 and leave hockey on espn and if cable cos play games and drop espn in favor of espn0 espn should alternate baseball and football between channels every week  but do the espn guys collectively have the gonads of the turner guy   mike eisler mreengsuncom  not only are they leafs the best team but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburghs  their  players are mighty bright too  i mean he really was going to get his  wallet back right jan brittenson 000 on leafpen woofers in  recsporthockey

   in the boston area you can hear the rangers on wfan and the devils on wabc the whalers on wtic and the red wings on wjr this of course is in addition to the bruins who are currently on weei but may move to whdh because the fools at weei are owned by the celtics and thus will show them over the bruins every time there is a conflict you can also get wbal baltimore but i dont think they have hockey btw i once got a station from indiana that had fort wayne comets games  
   showing a meaningless relatively baseball game over the overtime of  game that was tied up with less than 0 seconds left on the clock  what actually happened  after the pens game i turned to espn and the game was nearly at the end of regular then the phone rang  i turened off the  tv  later when i turned it back on the indians were on  then a little later the hockey games was on again then the baseball game what was actually on  not that it matters any more but some hockey was in deed on

  all these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at njd they are a very deep team with two very capable goalies and excellent forwards and defensemen  shooter in richer an all around do it all in todd chef stasnymaster of a thousand dishes power play captainstevens  take a look at the numbers or play with them and see for yourselves  
  way back in the early years 00s it took 0 wins to garner the stanley cup  soooooo a couple of local fish mongers local to the joe louis arena that is started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win  after each victory one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the ice  they are dead by the way  it was a brilliant marketing strategy to shore up the demand for one of their least popular products  hope this helps  j lange

  can the sabres win two more games against the bruins  i think game three in buffalo will be the most important of the series  if the sabres lose that game the party will be over  it will  be hello next year  the key for the remaining games in the series will be whether fuhr can keep up his brillliant goaltending and if mogilny can continue skate by  the bruins  he has shown demonstrated excellent speed  finally the sabres appear to have shown up for the post season       sabresbills fan

  hooray i hear on tsn that the jets have won a game selanne getting a hattrick  of course here in gods country read ontario i couldnt see that game nor any other in the vanwpg series so far because our beloved cbc figures no one out here cares about this series which has looked pretty competitve so far  on monday and wednesday nights cbc could have shown the toronto detroit game done the news then picked up winnipegvancouver they didnt  tonight  you guessed it torontodetroit the news not the end of the jets game then calgaryla  so if its hockey night in canada why cant this ontarian see one of the two series with two canadian teams  is this too much to ask  paul badertscher 000000000uwovaxuwoca

  according to the hockey gurus over at espn should the islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record but the devils will be playing the penguins  this is because the islanders have won the season series against the devils  i think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include  0  season series 0  goals against 0  goals for  in this order correct me if im wrong  anyone have anything to add   i thought it was 0 wins 0 goals for  gerald

       as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and doesnt know anything about him i dont know whether it is just this area pittsburgh of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether hes a canadian thing altogether  seriously what is he all about  i  hes a canadian thing former coach of the boston bruins and colorado rockies from the summaries that get posted i gather that his ongoing beef this year has been the conventional wisdom that canadian hockey is doomed to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the us and european programs  know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question is what is the deal with him  secondly are the comments of his that i  after he left the rockies he got a job with cbcs hockey night in canada and hasnt looked back since actually he did work for cbc at least on playoff season after the rockies were eliminated  read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him seriously  i gotta tell you from what i see he really sounds like an  id say its a combination of flame bait and serious journalism the closest thing youll find to cherry in the us is stan fischler a selfdescribed hockey maven the similarities are that they both say things that get people upset the difference is that cherry knows the game and fischler doesnt  ass  let me know  maybe im missing something  dons a character if he were completely rational and noncontroversial he wouldnt have a job by some definitions he could be called an ass but then some people feel the same about mike lang another character that i wish would get wider exposure only one national telecast last year   mike eisler mreengsuncom  not only are they leafs the best team but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than pittsburghs  their  players are mighty bright too  i mean he really was going to get his  wallet back right jan brittenson 000 on leafpen woofers in  recsporthockey

  st         as for more captain trivia the next edmonton st         catain was lee fogilin who was later traded to st         the buffalo sabres after him was wayne gretzky st         who w   traded to l a then came kevin low who st         nly this year was traded to the n y rangers   wasnt mark messier captain of the oilers before kevin lowe but of course he was traded as well  so your point of every oilers captain being traded is still true   stephen legge sleggekeanucsmunca   
   so all us hockeyautomobile racing fans all know exactly where we stand espn delays the martinsville race by a day for the nfl draft espn shows baseball instead of the overtime of a nhl playoff game  gimme a break guys    does anyone know why this race is tape delay especially until monday   is this the weekend for the nfl draft   if so postponing the race for a day is   a real slap in the face for racing fans   im afraid youre right as usual as i recall theyve been doing this   ever since they started covering the draft live i wish they could work   out some kind of a deal with somebody else such as tnn to get the race   on live but i guess espn isnt much into sharing it also clarifies   where auto racing stands on their priority list as if we didnt already   know     charlie shub  cdashcscoloradoedu       or         000 0000000      on leave at the university of iowa  cdashcsuiowaedu 000 0000000

   interestingly keenans cocoach or is it his number one on team canada at the world championships is roger neilsen     but ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the initiative within the limits of his systemwhile roger has a reactive hockey philosophywhich is why messier will be able to and has played for keenan but thought rogers way was a sure loser  itd be interesting if the rangers call in the balance of neilsens contract to be keenans assistant   roger did do a very good job with the mediocre players just as he handled the cinderella canucks of 00 years ago  but his mistake was playing the rangers like those canucks last may    roger is a great assistant coachbut considering what must be bad blood between nielson and messier it would be a mistake to bring him back even in that role  gerald  
  losers like us you are the fucking moron who has never heard of the western business school or the university of western ontario for that matter why  dont you pull your head out of your asshole and smell something other than shit for once so you can look on a map to see where uwo is back to hockey the north stars should be moved because for the past few years they have just been shit a real team like toronto would never be moved  not only have i not heard of the western business school or the university of western ontario ive never even wondered if there was a western ontario  and judging by the quality of the posts coming from there im still not sure that the place exists  perhaps i should be impressed though since it appears that grade school children in that area have access to the internet  rick  
  william k willis ww0aandrewcmuedu writes        as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and doesnt know anything about him i dont know whether it is just this area pittsburgh of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether hes a canadian thing altogether  seriously what is he all about  i know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question is what is the deal with him  secondly are the comments of his that i read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him seriously  i gotta tell you from what i see he really sounds like an ass  let me know  maybe im missing something  from his topps rookie year as coach card 0000 for the past couple of seasons don has been the highlysuccessful  coach of the rochester americans of the ahl but he is getting his  first shot at an nhl job with the bruins  named coach of the year  in the ahl the last two years and he aims to make the bruins a  rough team again as they were a couple of years back  although  he played 00 seasons of professional hockey don never played a  regularseason nhl game  he did appear in one playoff game for  boston in 000000  dons brother dick played two seasons in the  nhl with boston and philadelphia      mark mckinzie              listen if theyre going to buy lunch boxes mckinziemathwiscedu  they might as well buy david cassidy lunch boxes uw dept of mathematics madison wi 00000                        david cassidy

     i watched the game germanyczechs in wc todayand i was astonished about  the behaviour of the german audience  the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went  it was not just those penalties most of all it was the penalty the referee didnt call on the czechs right before their first goal   grazy they threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis  that stupid or what i guess the canadian referee one of the  isostarbros  gave the german team a penalty for that but it didnt help  much  i guess the germans just are proud over their nazikillemalleveryone  dont you think its quite silly to call it a nazi attitude when some people  throw coins on the ice hey i dont approve the behavior of these guys especially not in a wc game but i cant see any reason for using the word nazi in this connection      butusgermanssucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude  in every possible sport remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer  soccer hooligans are not just a german problem remember the world cup in italy again theres a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shopwindows or fighting with other socalled fans who come to a wc just to see if the dutch or the english or the germans are the best bruisers which other sports are you talking about i dont think soccer is every possible sport   it really pisses me off  i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks but   most of them seem to do  how many germans do you know do you think 000 out of 00000 is most of them  if you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the us what do you think about the americans most of them like beating blacks     jokke kylmaoja  golfphoenixoulufi      robert  
    id like to see some playoff games since im stuck in buffalo at ub but i think boston isnt giving up so easy  no boston probably wont go down easy but if the sabres hadnt won game one buffalo would have been out in four  and what problem are you having with playoff games here in buffalo theres the sabresbruins quebecmontreal and whatever espn and abc show and on opposite nights theres torontodetroit and whatever espnabc shows  more hockey than a good chunk of north america either side of the border  its wonderful and there are thousands of folks whod kill to be in your shoes coveragewise       valerie hammerl        john sr would lift pat over the boards grab  hammerlacsubuffaloedu       his hand and start running around the outside v000pwpzubvmsccbuffaloedu  faster and faster  i wanted to learn how to  get that feeling and the only way was to learn how to skate  p lafontaine  
  what about including points  probably no goals at least against opponents but there have been several assists given         ian neath         there are four kinds of people in this world neathpsychpurdueedu  cretins fools morons and lunatics  u eco  
  help  im stuck here at a computer in new jersey and have no access to a radio or tv  could someone kindly post the score of the canucksjets game  thanks in advance  mark  
  is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad  i cant remember how many times during the penguinsdevils game they showed some guy without the puck being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal  in fact i think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner  now the last time i watched a football game they didnt show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown       is it just me  greg   
   nluxenonstanfordedu nelson lu writes  00dody woodseason 0st  acquired0rd round pick in 0000 entry draft  gradei dd although perhaps i shouldnt give a grade at all    i have been accused of knocking on wood too much    you nah     he was seriously unimpressive even as a tough guy his rep however as  few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless i hate  to judge the talent too quickly butn in dodys case im tempted to make an  exception    but i wont  wood played most of his junior career in seattle  he was one of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in 0000  he rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in the whl  however i was extremely surprised when he was drafted especially in the third round  he certainly didnt look like nhl material   paul brownlow         visualize  data io corp  redmond wa   whirled pauldataiocom    peas   
   tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov i think thats it or a       defenseman rob niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong  rob niedermayer is a forward center i think with the whl medicine hat tigers  his brother scott is a defenseman now with the nj devils   paul brownlow         visualize  data io corp  redmond wa   whirled pauldataiocom    peas   
   okay heres some gripeing griping whatever  i live in santa barbara for reference i think  okay abc showed the kingsflames fine yawn  espn through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the   red wingstoronto game cool  but i swear that the advertisements all week long had said that   espn would show pittnj on tuesday and bosbuff on thursday  i raced home from work early 000 pacific to catch the game but   alas it was the bostonbuffalo game and then they promised that they would   show the pittnj game on thursday  overnight they changed their mind  i didnt mind that much  i watched the game hockey is much better   than no hockey  during the game their were no video highlights from the   patrick division  what the hell was going on  at least they should show   video highlights of the other games especially the nyicaps game that was   so close  my father lives in bowling green kentucky bumbfck egypt   got to watch the pens game on espn  i just dont get it  the biggest problem is that buffalo or boston fans who didnt want   to see the pittsburghnew jersey game 0 will turn on their tvs on thursday   and see the pittsburghnew jersey game 0 instead of the buffaloboston game   0  at least in my case i just had to wait 0 more days to see my game  if i were a big boston or buffalo fan and i missed the game on   tuesday due to false advertising on the part of espn id be mad as   hell  oh well hopefully well get better coverage next year or   something  matt coohill  ps  the announcers for the buffaloboston were the worst that i have ever heard as far emotion goes  they had the enthusiasm of droopy dog  i hope for better on thursday  
  it is meaningless to compare one players plusminus statistic with another players out of the context of the role and the playing time of the players involved      to compare jagrs and franciss plusminus is ridiculous and absurd  gerald   
  way back in the early years 00s it took 0 wins to garner the stanley cup  soooooo a couple of local fish mongers local to the joe louis arena that is started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win  after each victory one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the ice  they are dead by the way  it was a brilliant marketing strategy to shore up the demand for one of their least popular products  hope this helps  j lange   local to the joe louis arena you mean local to olympia stadium where red wings games were played until fairly recently early 00s comes to mind as far as i know the rest of the post is basically correct if what you meant by local was simply detroit and im being incredibly picky okay sorry about that    david nichols        senior statistical support specialist         spss inc  phone 000 0000000     internet  nicholsspsscom     fax 000 0000000   any correlation between my views and those of spss is strictly due to chance

  i have been to all 0 islescaps tilts at the crap centre this year all isles wins and there is no justification for vukota and pilon to play for the isles vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world he couldnt hit a bull in the ass with a banjo al must remember a few years back when mick  scored 0 goals in one period against the caps in a 00 isles win i was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd wakeup al years later hes gotten worse hes a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupidsenseless penalties i think he would make a good police officier  as for pilon he cant carry the puck out to center ice by himself he either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover or he attempts to bring the puck  towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater he cant stay on his skates with most forwards or centers he either falls down or  committs a penalty call up somebody from capital district al  as far as the playoffs the isles are as difficult to figure out as the caps two good teams with talent but so inconsistent they should meet in the first round the isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against jersey tonite itll probably be another tight 0goal game as the last 00 games hve been for the isles i wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game al must understand he cant do with this team what he did with the 0000 isles maybe al should got to where is bobby nystrom clark gilles john tonelli these are the kind of young minds we need behing the bench    fire al  john scialdone scialdonenssdcagsfcnasagov  when your ship comes in first man takes the sail

  you should be ashamed to call yourself an ulf samuelson fan anybody who plays the way he does does not belong in the nhl there have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game but a lot of them have been talanted players bobby clarke kenny linsemen pie mckenzie chris chelios etc but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as ulf violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like should have been a women samuelson dont belong when players like ulf whos main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue and the league wont stop it the players should a christian pro 0000 aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely if the bruins get a chance to meet pittsburgh in the near future you can bet neely will have his day the sight of watching ulf turtle up like the coward he is is worth almost as much as a stanely cup this wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game if you are to remove ulf samuelson from the lineup the penguins would not even notice hes gone hes an eyesore on the game of hockey   rich

  brad gibson gibsonnuktageopubcca wrote  much text deleted     plusminus  it is the most misleading hockey stat available  not necessarily the most misleading but you are right it definitely needs to be taken in the proper perspective a shining example is if you look at the penguins individual  you will find very few minuses that only makes common sense since they didnt lose many games     until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice    time per game and some measure of its quality ie is the player put out    in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up    against the other teams top one or two lines shorthanded etc i would    much rather see the  disappear altogether instead of having its dubious    merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications  unfortunately you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to really come up with a statistic which really shows a players value lets just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it like im doing now excuse me    tom huot                huotcraycom

  i cant believe that the ny rangers would force its  players to go to binghamtom to play in the ahl playoffs instead of letting them represent their countries in the world championships  anderrson and zubov are waiting for the nhl to make a decision to this while kovalev has given in and gone down to the minors  the rangers are a disgrace  ps it has been reported that neil smith was very much against the hiring of mike keenan how long will smith be in ny for  the godfather

  00000    blues shutout hawks again lead series 00  it was a great atmosphere last night at the st louis arena as joseph and the blues shutout the hawks for the second consecutive game people were cheering the blues long before faceoff time and they kept going for the entire game my friends and i went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players heres a game summary from the st louis postdisptach enjoy  by dave luecking of the postdispatch staff  at 0000 pm friday night the arena crowd of 00000 paid homage to blues goalie curtis joseph the fans began bowing their arms extended taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read only god saves more than joseph  it was a fitting tribute to joseph who has brought the blues to the verge of a surprising sweep  joseph recorded his second successive shutout friday blanking the blackhawks 00 in game 0 of the norris division semifinals and giving the blues a 00 lead in the bestofseven series  the blackhawks havent scored against joseph since the 000 mark of the second period of game 0 joseph has shut out the blackhawks for 000 minutes 0 seconds a blues record jacques plante held the previous record of 00000 set in the first round of the 0000 playoffs against the philadelphia flyers one of only two series the blues have sweeped in their history  the blues can wrap up their first sweep since 0000 with a victory in game 0 a nationally televised game that begins at noon sunday the blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history both in 0000 when they swept philadelphia and los angeles en route to the stanley cup finals  the shutout friday was easier than on wednesday in game 0 when joseph had to make 00 saves this time the blues held the shots down to 00 and the blackhawks couldnt touch joseph  well they touched joseph numerous times shoving him and pushing him at  every opportunity to try to get him off his game but joseph and the blues were unfazed dishing out their own punishment along the way  the blues grinders  bob bassen rich sutter kevin miller and dave lowry  wore down the blackhawks taking the visitors from chicago off their game the grinders set the stage for the glamour boys the gifted playmakers and scorers who made the most of their opportunities  craig janney brett hull and nelson emerson scored getting one goal in each period hull assisted on janneys firstperiod power play goal after two unwise chicago penalties checker miller set up hulls goal in the second period and rookie denny felsner assisted for emerson who scored at 0000 of the final  period  blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling sweep sweep sweep they also taunted chicago goalie ed belfour  bellfour bellfour they also chanted na nanana heyhey good bye  such talk is a tad premature theres still one game left but the blues are on a roll they have the blackhawks on their heels  the blues set the tone early on friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play rich sutter leveled bryan marchment and brendan shanahan dumped steve smith at center ice  chicago tried to retaliate but troy murrays decision to run into joseph backfired referee dan marouelli gave him a roughing penalty  the blues didnt get a shot on goal on the power play and they survived a scare after chicago killed the penalty when rick zombo gave the puck away to steve larmer joseph stopped larmers shot and everything else chicago threw at him in the first period the hawks ignored the scouting report on joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low where josephs butterfly style is deadly  rookie bret hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period  two for hooking and one for holding  but chicago got only two shots on goal as many as miller the blues penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against belfour   marouelli began calling penalties on the blackhawks to even things up he caught brent sutter hooking shanahan four seconds after hedicans third penalty he called marchment for elbowing janney along the boards at 0000 and gave the blues a twoman advantage 000 later when christian ruuttu slashed shanahan  the blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play and hull got it where he likes it  in the high slot hulls shot hit belfours right shoulder and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line belfour dived back to cover but the puck squirted loose to janney who poked it into the net at 0000 for his first goal of the playoffs  the blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended and the blackhawks lost their composure joe murphy tripped ron wilson with two seconds remaining in the period and after time had expired smith upset the blues by shooting the puck into the blues bench  chris chelios made a move toward joseph as the teams left the ice and marouelli slapped him with a 00minute misconduct chicago survived the blues power play but the loss of chelios hurt he didnt return until the midway point of the period and within three minutes of his return hull had increased the blues lead to 00 deflecting in millers crisp pass  try as they might the blackhawks couldnt get to joseph who stopped everything they could throw at him he stopped 00 shots in the second period and 00 more in the third chicago also hit the goalpost twice  emersons goal put the game away he went hard to the net and redirected felsners pass                                          a l l e z   l e s   b l u e s

   the flyers blew a 00 lead over the buffalo sabres in the second period but kevin dineens 0th career hat trick powered them to their 0th consecutive win 00 over the sabres who have now lost 0 in a row alexander mogilny led the comeback scoring his 00th and 00th goals of the season which tied the game at 0 in the 0nd period and 0 in the 0rd tommy soderstrom stopped 00 of 00 shots on goal to improve his own record to 00000 as he was tested by mogilny and lafontaine all night  roster move  andre faust was once again recalled from hershey shawn cronin was a healthy scratch  lines  eklundlindrosrecchi beranekbrindamourdineen lomakinbutsayevconroy faustactonbrown  galleybowen yushkevichhawgood carknermcgill  tommy soderstrom  game summary  say if anybody from buffalo is reading this where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems we had to turn down the volume  the flyers defense started out the game showing everybody why the flyers have been shutting teams out lately by holding the sabres to only 0 shots in the first period they then showed everybody why they will be playing golf sunday when they gave up 00 shots in the last two periods maybe tommy told them that he was getting bored back there  mark recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it after buffalo won the faceoff and dumped tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to eric 00 way up on his left eric dropped it to galley and he sent it ahead to recchi steaming out of the zone mark skated into the center circle passed the puck to himself through the legs of richard smehlik skated around him and in on fuhr smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to the right past fuhr for a 00 flyers lead at 000 it was so beautiful eric and garry should turn down their assists   the flyers kept the pressure on fuhr for a while after that but he was strong and kept the flyers from doing further damage the game then became a defensive struggle for a while the sabres got the first chance on the power play when terry carkner took a boarding minor at 0000 for crunching dale hawerchuk into the boards in the flyers zone lafontaine got the only scoring chance and not a terribly good one as the flyers smothered the sabres power play mogilny got a post after it was over the 00th consecutive penalty kill for the flyers  keith carney took a holding penalty at 0000 for taking down mark recchi to give the flyers a power play the best penalty killing team in the league didnt allow the flyers a shot on goal although the flyers did create a good scoring chance for lindros who partially fanned on his shot towards the end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody kept missing the net greg hawgood took an interference penalty at 0000 to give the sabres another power play but they couldnt get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck shots were 00 buffalo after the flyers had led 00 at one point  mike emrick interviewed flyers president jay snider between periods jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs but not discouraged this was considered a rebuilding year after the trade and he seemed very happy with the way the season went when asked if he agonized over the trade he said that it was russ farwells trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and ed snider as far as the money but yes there was some agonizing and theyd do it all over again when asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that its russ call and russ will evaluate things at the end of the season he feels that theyre 0 years away from a shot at the cup he expects to get into the playoffs next year have a shot at a division title the following year and a shot at the finals the year after that this based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer  hes very happy with the realignment he called it outstanding happy with the current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable seemed to like the idea of playing in the olympics booo but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus  the sabres gave the flyers their second power play of the game when brad may took a tripping penalty at 000 of the second the flyers had a little trouble getting started but eventually did hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to eklund just outside the sabres blue line along the right boards eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle he half fanned on it and sent the puck trickling through the slot fuhr didnt know where it was though and hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 000  then mogilny on a breakaway he slipped through two flyers at the blue line and went in on soderstrom he went with the backhander but soderstrom was all over it  the flyers then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them viacheslav butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to gary dornhoefer took a dive to get the other there was no video at 000 the sabres coudlnt get started ryan mcgill poked at the puck just after a sabre carried into the flyers zone and after a bunch of people poked at it dineen emerged with it and headed the other way it started out a 0 on 0 but brindamour hustled ahead to make it a 0 on 0 and back off the defenseman dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 00 flyers at 000 that was all for fuhr john muckler sent in dominik hasek to take over  but the sabres still had lots of power play time again they took some time to just get into the flyers zone and when they finally did the flyers were all over them boos began to ring through the building but they finally got through soderstrom on an ugly goal smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to hawerchuk in the slot hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as galley dove down to block it mistake 0 he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about a the rebound or b barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net well the rebound dropped right next to soderstrom and mistake 0 galley just laid there and watched barnaby get three hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie he didnt even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away with the goal at 000 two streaks end for the flyers 00000 of shutout hockey and 00 straight penalty kills  lindros put them right back on the power play at 000 with a high sticking minor i think it was barnaby again this time the sabres were able to get set up quickly but couldnt get too much quality on goal the sabres continued to keep the puck in the flyers end for a while after the power play ended things evetually settled down but then the other very bad penalty mcgill allowed barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff the gloves were dropped and mcgill started pounding the crap out of him but during the fight he gave barnaby a head butt with his helmet and that meant a match penalty 0 for slashing 0 fighting and 0 for the major 0 minutes of power play time for the sabres at 0000 barnaby only got 0  the flyers were keeping them at bay for a while but there was only so long they could do that after a couple of good sabre chances audette handed to ledyard at the point and ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by soderstrom lafontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net and knocked it over to randy wood at the right soderstrom had moved over to play lafontaine and since yushkevich and carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men wood just slid it into the empty net at 0000 to close the flyers lead to 00 lafontaine was actually trying to put it on net but half fanned on it and got a break  the flyers then got some shorthanded pressure in the sabres zone but hasek was strong finally it was keith carney passing ahead to hawerchuk into the neutral zone and hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to mogilny at the flyers blue line another minibreakaway for mogilny he elected to shoot from the left circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 0000 for his 00th of the season ironically the youth hockey tip between the 0st and second period was tommy soderstrom talking about cutting off angles  that was all in the 0nd shots were 000 sabres  into the 0rd period and pelle eklund blew a golden opportunity to get the flyers the lead back a 0 on 0 acton with the puck he dropped to eklund in the slot and eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from when he finally did shoot he hit the far post that was still during the carryover power play time  than an incredible almost goal randy wood skated around recchi and hawgood untouched into soderstrom soderstrom goes down wood pokes the puck under soderstrom and a black object hits the back of the net red light comes on horn sounds crowd cheers but up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing well it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net not the puck emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net  dave hannan then took out recchi and got a holding minor at 000 the flyers could not get anything going at all they finally got set up 00 way through but were kept on the perimeter as time ran out beranek stripped the puck from a sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to eklund at the top of the left circle eklund saw dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him dineen fumbled the pass but twice directed it at hasek and eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 00th at 000 00 flyers  but the sabres came right back lafontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to bob erry behind the flyers net erry started to skate out but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net mogilny flew in skated around and stuffed it through soderstroms 0 hole for his 00th at 000 to tie the game at 0  then hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 000 the flyers set up in the sabres zone and stayed there off a faceoff high in the sabres zone in the middle while brindamour wrestled for the puck dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to haseks glove side at 000  play started to go back and forth until hawgood took a roughing penalty at 000 the flyers dumped the puck into the sabres zone brindamour and ledyard went after it and rod got the puck he backed away from the right boards skated to the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to dineen crashing through the slot all by himself dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of hasek for a 00 flyers lead at 000 0rd hat trick of the season for dineen 0th of his career 0nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 00th of the season  then carney took a tripping penalty at 000 to kill the rest of the sabres power play not much action on the 0 on 0 and the sabres got most of the chances on the flyers resulting power play  play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves the sabres werent able to pull hasek as time was running  out as the flyers wouldnt allow any consistant possession for the sabres finally as time was running out ken sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and brindamour stripped it away from him he pulled away and found dineen on the other side of the left circle and dineen found acton at the right of hasek he slid the puck between two sabres defenders and acton chipped it back to the far side of hasek for his 0th of the season at 0000 on his 00th birthday that was all the scoring shots were 0000 buffalo and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game  so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who hadnt been tested much in his last couple of starts kevin dineen has a career high 0 point night unless he had a better night earlier in the season but i dont think so the flyers longest winning streak in 0 years 00 goals for only 00 against with three shutouts eric lindros is 0th in league with 00 even strength goals despite missing 00 games with injury 0 points out of 0th clinched 0th place since the rangers lose the tie breaker  a couple misc notes  forget the mike keenan rumors there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the new york rangers next year  in the last notes i mentioned that garry galley won the barry ashbee award but i failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman  the times of trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from oklahoma has looked over tommy soderstroms medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future  same paper had a blurb about bill dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year his response was that he wants to come back he feels he did a good job this year but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if farwell didnt want him back  flyers team record watch  eric lindros  00 goals 00 assists 00 points  rookie records club record

  00peter aholaseason 0nd acquired0000 trade with pittsburgh for future considerations gradei b  it is way too early to tell about ahola who was acquired probably because the penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft  ahola had only played 00 games this season i think its actually less the san jose mercury news may be in err here 00 of them with the sharks  in the games he has played he appeared quite solid defensively although he hasnt been spectacular and his offense isnt anything to write home about 0 points its even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be  peter ahola  00doug wilsonseason 00th acquired0000 trade with chicago for rw kerry toporowski and 0nd round pick in 00 entry draft gradei b  i have often been accused of overly down on wilson i may have had too high expectations for him but his legs knees et al are giving out nevertheless when he was playing he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities even if he has lost a step on defense which unfortunately he demonstrated this year as well as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards and his offensive output was only good enough for 0nd place on the team 00 points in 00 games  but next year which may be wilsons last if he can stay healthy he can still be a contributor  00dean kolstadseason0nd acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradei cd  its probably somewhat unfair for me to judge kolstad on just a handful of games forgetting exact number but no more than 00 but at age 00 hes quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the nhl  in those games he did not impress anyone after generating 0 shots in the first period of the first game he played he scored just 0 points in his tenure up here with the sharks and was even less impressive defensively as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways  he needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team  00pat macleodseason 0nd acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradei   macleod was on the roster a lot longer than kolstad but it appears to my memory that he played less than kolstad because the sharks were reluctant to use him but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors figuring that he wouldnt clear waivers in fact he has played the past 00 weeks with kansas city but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment a rehab assignment that will include him playing in the turner cup playoffs since he has played so little i cant even give a tentative grade on him but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills  00tom pedersonseason 0st acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradei b  called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries pederson impressed many sharks fan here on net including yours truly  he demonstrated very good offensive skills scoring 00 points in 00 games  however his size 0 0 000 lbs is of concern and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically on both sides of the ice although he had appeared fearless in his approach but to be successful he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league  00claudio screminseason 0st acquired0000 from minnesota in dispersal draft gradei dd  he played all of 0 games in the league this year but was thoroughly umimpressive just as he was at the end of last season again it may be a small sample but just as in the case of kolstad scremin at age 00 is quickly running out of time  he was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the sharks  the only notable thing that will go down in scremins entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now capitals goaltender don beaupre   go calgary flames  al macinnis for norris  gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers  go for playoffs next year  stay in edmonton  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu recsporthockey contact for the san jose sharks

   and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded   resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other   team captain trivia would be appreciated    brad mccrimmon was the captain of the flames when he was traded to detroit  following the 000000 season this was during the offseason though    theres countless examples of captains being traded im sure  yeah i think that the flames and the flyers traded captains once mel   bridgeman for brad marsh  craig  
  nhmasgaussmedharvardedu mark shneyder 0000000 writes  the problem espn0 faces is the tcicablevision connection in the merger of their prime and sportschannel networks prime sportschannel will try to wrestle away nhl from espn in the offseason also tci and cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the country with a total of 00 million subscribers tcicablevision will do their best that espn0 never gets off the ground successfully and the nhls value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between prime sc and espn nhl is more vital to the survival of a regionalized prime sportschannel since they virtually have no national major league sports contracts and only cover local nhlnbamlb sports teams  note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various sc and prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local nhl owners whenif cablevision vp chuck dolans purchase of the islanders goes through the islanders will be back solidly in the scny fold their original owners were and theyve remained due to a lucrative tv contract  the flyer snyders own the philadelphia sc as well as the prism pay channel  there are six teams affiliated with regional scs another half dozen affiliated with prime outlets and other locals like hts and nesn who have barter arrangements  with all this crossownership i was surprised that espn got the deal this  season  gld   je me souviens  gary l dare  gldcolumbiaedu go  winnipeg jets  go  gldcunixcbitnetselanne  domi  stanley

  allancsualbertaca allan sullivan writes    i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton  oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference  next week while the exact details are not known it is believed  to concern the oilers future   rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement  with copps collesium in hamilton during the press conference  pocklington may announce the deal it is quite possible that  the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to  renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium   northlands has offered to buy the oilers for 00 million earlier  but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington   as for me my opinion is divided edmonton has been fairly  supportive of the oilers even though theyre a small market  team they had many sellouts in the 00s even with the problems  that the team had this year they still brought in more fans  than many teams in larger cities did on the other hand if  the team does move there is no place more deserving than  hamilton of course how would that affect the grand  realignment scheme of bettman     following up on this the provincial government has been asked by the opposition to block any deal that pocklington is offering to hamilton  the government said that pock is going nowhere    why dont i believe the government  wasnt it pocklington who wanted to be tory leader 0 years ago  dave shariff yadallee b sceconmath u of alberta 0000  yadalleeersysedmontonabca god save the queen god bless us allremember jesus saves lives from eternal damnation newfoundland keep good old clyde vote liberal

  i prefer to watch hockey than seeing shots of felix potvin slashing and spearing dino ciccerelli standing in front of the net  he has every right to stand in front of the net just not in the crease    yes he does  but the goalie sure as hell doesnt want him there  when  i played roller hockey boy do i miss those days as a goalie i would  scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot  i dont care if hes  in the crease or not get him the hell away from me so i can see the ball  yes roller hockey remember  and if there was nobody around to clear  the slot then id do it myself by pushing the offending playerhard   i hate people in my way when im the goalie and i am sure felix does  too  i should say that i didnt see the incident so if potvin really  swung the stick big time then thats not right but he can move people  out of the way  hes a player on the ice too you know            keith kellerlets go rangers  kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs       in this cornerlets go quakers       weighing in at almost every weight imaginable           life and all that surrounds it      blues traveler 0000 i have to agree wholeheartedly with this view  i dont like to see stickwork but you have to clear players away from in front  my personal favorite move im a goalie too is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref isnt looking  makes em go down like a ton of bricks but doesnt cause injuries unless they dont know how to fall im  talking about hitting the blades here not the foot  it also makes the  player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty  unfortunately it also leaves your blocker out of  position for a short timei dont do this if a shot is likely on the short side  hmmmaybe i should mail potvin this method in french and with helpful diagrams of course  it sure would be nice to see ciccerelli who i have a great deal of respect for btw hes not a big guy but he plays huge fall on his back a few times    barfly  
  theyre real and theyre spectacular the blues shutout the blackhawks in consecutive playoff games   if the blues sweep the hawks on sunday i will launch a broom onto the ice in the last seconds of the game not that theres anything wrong with that  curtis joseph has been the master of his own domain and the hawks have been shooting the puck like a bunch of chuckers not even superman could play any better in goal joseph must have been eating his cereal  its like a sauna in here said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and the wild crowd at the arena  it was very refreshing to see the blues doubledip the hawks  the hawks goons tried to pick on hull janney and joseph but the blues checking line nipped those hawks real well  the fat yoyoma will sing on sunday and the hawks will head to the beach the hawks trip back to chicago will feel like a long journey from milan to minsk  enjoy sundays game with some junior mints and wash them down with a snapple  just a little fun                                          a l l e z   l e s   b l u e s                                                                                                                                joe ashkar                                                              contact for the blues                            saint louis           jca0cec0wustledu                                        blues                                              
    roger neilson is not property  among other rumours hes now the 0 candidate to coach the flyers and will bring along colin campbell as his assistant   this would be dumb move of the ninetieslindros is big and strong but why give him a ball and chain on one leg and an anchor on the other to drag along   compuware is actively scouting phoenix for a new team in 0000 hey nick and jimmy  buy the devils and fix them here please  gld   not if pocklington gets there first actually if pocklington doesnt get a better deal he would probably go to hamiltontaking the team out of canada would get the whole country mad at him taking the team to hamilton wouldnt get anybody mad at him that  isnt mad at him alreadyand would make him a lot of friends in southern ontarioso many that the whining of the stupid politicians in edmonton and the fickle spoiled fans wouldnt be noticed at all edmonton would wallow in anonymnity  gerald  
  georgehgjhsun george h writes  lmarshacmsccwayneedu laurie marshall writes  don got his nickname grapes but im not sure  don use to coach the boston bruins  i dont know exactly when that was  could someone fill me in on this info  i think that the name grapes came because as coach for the bruins  or in the minors  he used to chew on grapes to keep from getting  dehydrated during the games  his dog blue may have been named  cause he liked labatts beer  anyone know about that   according to quotations from chairman cherry don was playing in springfield he and another player had to pay some fines the other player had his paid off but not don didnt want to  don called the other player a teachers pet and the other player replied ah thats just sour grapes  dont know how accurate that is but thats whats printed   
    the keenan hiring is precipitated by the loss of an anticipated 0m in playoff revenue and fears of losing season ticketholders  plus paramount chief stan jaffes chip against the flyers over laffaire lindros last autumn  add to this that neilsen might return as an assistant coach gerald whatd i say earlier today and roger conferred with jaffe on the hiring  this hiring by jaffe went over the head of msg inc par subsidiary head bob gutkowski and over the head and the protests of presgm neil smith   msg is making the announcement on saturday to get back at the islanders for making the playoffs ie steal the press   flyers owner ed snyder is livid and beside himself over this   keenan will make up to 000000yr   gary bettman has appointed an independent consul to look at gil steins admission into the hall of fame   new crease colours rather than blue   the oilers will charge to eat in the press room next year  gld   je me souviens  gary l dare  gldcolumbiaedu go  winnipeg jets  go  gldcunixcbitnetselanne  domi  stanley

  its about time the boys got it together they were outworked and outplayed by the wings in the first two games but burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear or is that high gear in game 0  except for a 0000 minute stretch in the 0nd period they outskated and outworked the wings  please dont flame this statement cos you know its true  i have to admit that  goaltending was the key  potvin kept the leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the leafs went through in the 0nd  he also kept the rebounds to a minimum something that cost cheveldae 0 goals  clark even looked like he had stopped moping first star although i still dont know why he was so flat in games 0 and 0  if the leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game 0 they may actually have a chance of winning this series a slim chance  but a chanceim no rmwhere is he anyways haha  barfly

  buffalo fans  some people in the discussion group as well as commentator al on espn  believe that game 0 is critical for the sabres  helloooo the sabres  are ahead 0 games to 0 not behind  as a lifelong sabres fan i am well  aware of their ability to choke but lets not exaggerate that  as long as  the sabres win one of the next 0 games be it game 0 or game 0 they are  still in good shape ahead 0 games to 0 with game 0 to be played at  buffalo  if they lose games three and four then start worrying  game 0 is  critical for boston not buffalo    rob andolina randolinpolisciumnedu     
  fuhr is proving the fuhrbashers wrong but boston is an awfully good team   yehbut   0biran sutters playoff record as the head coach in stl wasnt very impressive his blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs it doesnt look like this trend will change with the bruins  0 bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 00 in their entire 00year history it doesnt look like buffalo will just lose their next two games at the aud with the way fuhr has been standing on his head  basicallythe bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend alsoit seems like the whole boston area has gone baseball crazy after an incredibly great start by the red soxbest record in their major leagues as of now i would say that 00 of the callers to the bruins flagship stationsportsradio 000 are talking about the red soxabout 00 are yapping about the patriots upcoming draft00 are on the celtics and about 0 are on the bruins somehowno one around here is really schocked the way bruins are folding early  ppv mark

   the thing that confuses me most about espn is that they decided to show the   penguins and devils again on thursday night  being that both of the first   two games were dominated by pitt you would think that they would show a   different game  this is in addition to the fact that they should show other   games just for the sake of fair exposure  espn must have some very poor marketing people  they are only concerned with featuring players ie mario than featuring good competitive hockey   also some of you should know that as far as i can tell espn is not going   to show campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds  i   believe that they are only going to show campbell games in the first two   rounds as those series wear on games 0  0 or perhaps games 0 0 0   ive heard that this is because most of their market is east coast and hence would prefer the wales stuff  also dont expect canadian teams on espn  in summary if you want to see a network that provides good hockey coverage  watch cbc from canada  they may be biased toward canadian teams but they dont treat the viewers like idiots they provide nice updates and don cherry will always provide a few laughs    
  just heard on the news that mike keenan formerly of the blackhawks flyers and general of a siberian prison has just signed to coach the rangers  the rangers who won the presidents cup last year have slipped just a bit at the end of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly flyers the flyers fans are going to be disappointed on keenans decision because they were very interested in him  oh well  at least we got somebody the flyers wanted   is this really true  i have not been keeping up with any news  if it is whats the deal with neil smith  is he gone too       keith kellerlets go rangers lets go quakers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs              when i want your opinion ill give it to you   
  according to the hockey gurus over at espn should the islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record but the devils will be playing the penguins  this is because the islanders have won the season series against the devils  i think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include  0  season series 0  goals against 0  goals for  in this order correct me if im wrong  anyone have anything to add  i think that they go to divisional records before goals but i could be wrong too       keith kellerlets go rangers lets go quakers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs              when i want your opinion ill give it to you

  espn is pathetic i have been watching everybody complain about espns coverage and i agree with all of you  might i suggest that we are getting all worked up over nothing  we all knew that espns coverage was going to suck  i mean have you ever watched during the regular season sportscenter coverage of hockey it sucks i mean really sucks  espn does not know hockey if it shot them in the ass  i was really pissed of about last night coverage  i go to school in ohio i know the indians suck so why show them  if i were bill clement i would shoot myself  anyway after i calmed down after i realized that they were not going to show overtime of the caps isles game i thought to myself i knew that this was going to happen in fact i remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even the boring devils game  overall i think espn does not care if they show hockey or not and i firmly belive that they have know respect for the fans ie because of contract        obligations screw you espn  praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit  go hawks   this is the price hockey fans have to pay for the mistake of leaving espn 0 or 0 years agoit will take time to correct for that mistake  but returning to espn was the correct decision last yearby next time we may have the potential for sportschannel and espn to really compete to offer better coverage and be forced to deliver on it   gerald  
   here we are with the sabres up 00 to the bruins and the sabres farm team the rochester amerks on their way to the calder cup urp and what kind of hockey coverage are we getting the same penguinsdevils every other day crap that everyone else gets whats worse the sportschannel coverage of the islanders appears to be blocked out since we got cba basketball last night if you can believe it  i assume the sabres are demanding the sc blackout not espn since we are unbelievably usually considered part of the islanders territory msg coverage of the rangers is blacked out here this despite being a solid seven hours plus from long island  does anyone know what grc is doing besides putting their satellite dish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels 0 00 and 00 did empire demand a fortune for the games what about the games on fox00 or whatever number it is there in buffalo has anyone phoned to complain besides me  george    george ferguson                 arpa fergusoncsrochesteredu dept of computer science       uucp rutgersrochesterferguson university of rochester         vox  000 0000000 rochester  ny  000000000       fax  000 0000000  
    buffalo is up 00 is the series with boston and the reasongrant fuhr    fuhr is playoff hungry and hes proving once again why they call him   money goaltender fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the   league anymore statistically at least but hes proving that he can   make the big save at the right time   the leafs should have kept fuhr and probably would have had a chance    against powerhouse detroit but againwhere was andreychoke in game 0  i applauded the sabres for making the deal to get fuhr specifically because i thought it would help them win at least one playoff series  however i dont think the leafs can be faulted eitherthere is nothing to say that felix wont be winning playoff series by himself in years to come    anyway does anybody else find it ironic that fuhr is up against moog or at least he was until a guy named alex showed up

  yahooooooooo  the habs tied this sucker at 0 and the teams now head for quebec city to play game 0  btw final score was habs 0nords 0  the score might be a bit misleading  the habs dominated the game from the 000 mark of the first and then on  the score should have been 00 if it werent for some miraculous save from a ron hextall bastard  hes the reason the score was as close  habs winning goal was scored by benoit brunet at 000 of the 0rd  roy had an ok game  he made the first save one way or another and the defense was there to clear any rebounds  this just in espn radio reports that the bruins lost 00 in ot yahooooooooooo  those suckers got what they deserved  life is just great now if my finals would go just as well  nick ill take off my town crier hat now    the czar of mainframe computing  bgk0musicbmcgillca  mcgill university   
   i will also be happy will a good performance  we played ok in vancouver but much better last night as the big guys were going for the jets    yep though my reasons for being relatively quiet are simplelast year i woofed when we went up 00 on the canucksand look where it got me    by the way did domi play last night  i didnt notice him on the ice    domi got tossed in the 0nd with a highsticking major  he had been playing with kris king and stu barnesand it was this line that was arguably the best in the first two games   i am very glad to have found some places in champaign illinois that have satillite dishes to pick up the cbc vancouver feed and im also glad to have found some other hockey fans some jets and some canucks fans to watch the game with    definitely a good thingevery little cheer helps evan   good thing the net doesnt need a voice to operatei wont have one sunday night when i get home i hope  white noise here we come     one thing i will say thoughvancouver can keep steve armitage and john garrett as a broadcast teamthose two are bad especially when you are spoiled by don wittman  at least four or five times steve called barnes selanne  whoops   daryl turner  rsh contact for the winnipeg jets  internet umturne0ccuumanitobaca   fidonet 0000000 or 00000  please route through 000000 tkachuk over to zhamnov up to selnne he shoots he scores  the jets win the cup  the jets win the cup essensa for vezina  housley for norris  selnne for calder  
  its over  the sabres came back to beat the bruins in ot 00 tonight to sweep the series a beautiful goal by brad may lafontaine set him up while lying down on the ice ended it fuhr left the game game with an injured shoulder and lafontaine was banged up as well however the sabres will get a weeks rest so injuries should not be a problem  montreal edged quebec 00 to square their series which seems to be headed for game 0 the habs dominated the first two periods and were unlucky to only have a 00 tie after 00 minutes however an early goal by brunet in the 0rd won it  the islanders won their 0rd ot game of the series on a goal by ray ferraro 00 the caps simply collapsed after taking a 00 lead in the 0nd the isles alltime playoff ot record is now 000   vlad the impaler  
  like many others i too was watching the capsisles game when the went to the baseball game  i too was pissed  how could they interupt such an important game  i understand about contracts but you would think they would have a clause in the contract concerning important games anyway  us blues and hawks fans got shafted worse  while everyone in the us and watched the game on abc  however those of us who live in the central illinois area were subjected to watching the arthritus telethon  the area that was most affected by the telecast did not get to see the game except through hawk vision  this game had it been televised would have been the first home hawks game shown in the area since 0000  this television bull has got to stop  we are not only being deprived of seeing games due to skyrocketing ticket prices but we are also being deprived of watching them on tv  peace  hammer    
  being a a blues fan i dont get to see much else from around the league with the exception of hockey night on espn  i cant get the blues games where i go to school thus i dont get to see a whole lot of other teams play except for the hawks  but last night i got to catch a glimpse of the capsisles game  it occurred to me that turgeon is a stud on skates his moves are quick and brilliant  you ny fans should be proud ps who won the game capsisles   peace hammer    
  bufflo sabres has just finished their great four wins over boston all sabres players contribute to those great wins but those talent players including mogily fuhr kemhlev and lafontin impressed me most their  skills showed the art of sport not like the garbage speech from the coachs corner  go  make hocky popular make hocky more exciting but less violent

   capsisles fans  anyone interested in catching the games from nassau coliseum hopefully there will be another can catch the game at north carolinas original sports bar in chapel hill  im pretty sure they carry hts as well they had all three games on at the same time last night  this is the only place i know to catch all of the stanley cup action  frank salvatore fmsalvateosncsuedu  
    i am sure some bashers of pens fans are pretty confused about the lack of any kind of posts about the recent pens massacre of the devils actually i am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved however i am going to put an end to nonpittsburghers relief with a bit of praise for the pens man they are killing those devils worse than i thought jagr just showed you why he is much better than his regular season stats he is also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoffs bowman should let jagr have a lot of fun in the next couple of games since the pens are going to beat the pulp out of jersey anyway i was very disappointed not to see the islanders lose the final regular season game          pens rule

     by the way i am canadian play a little and watched  hockey night in canada never missed a show  well thats really great pat  i guess since youve played a little you thereby  qualify as an expert  especially since you watch all the games on tv  all  that qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato   not that i condone violence but ill make an exception for mario pat walker  again just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are  truly a  stupid statement  mario is definately one of the best players to play the game im not saying he is the best to ever play the game but he should come to mind when that question is asked  lets face it he just returns from  radiation therapy with around a dozen games left overtakes lafontaine for the scoring lead and then buries him  no i guess he just got lucky speaking of lafontaine now theres a guy who should be considered for the hart trophy as well certainly one of the better players in the league this year

  im a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best i can here in the hockey hinterlands oklahoma  im hoping i can get a reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas  ive been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly the hockey state in the us  so why is the team moving to a city in texas  is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or were the stars really not making a profit  or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging  as much as id like to see the nhl only a 0 hour drive from me i cant help but feel for the people in minnesota unless they truly didnt support the team    opinions please  steve hunter national weather service nexrad radar group norman ok

in a wc for the first time since 0000 and the swiss  now have a small chance of reaching the quarterfinals if austria beats  italy tonight   the swiss took the lead after hakan ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop  pass at his own blue line and celio came in alone with soderstrom and beat  tommy to the stick side the swedes continued to make mistakes as howald  was allowed to skate in between the swedish d and put the puck past tommy  to make it 00 00 was a nice one howald entered the swedish zone slammed  on the breaks and his shot went in by tommys far post one of the lousiest  periods ive seen sweden play this year  second period saw a new swedish team and the swiss had to ice the puck many  times on a pp nylander skated in from the boards pavoni made the initial  save but peter andersson scored on the rebound  then a power play goal  from the swiss a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way  to the goal and past soderstrom also jonas bergqvist made it 00 after a  nice pass from naslund behind the goal jan larsson reduced the lead to 00  just before the end of 0nd period on a pp skated in unattacked in front of  the goal and put the puck through pavonis 0hole   third period sweden equalized on a slap shot from renberg that trickled  through pavonis 0hole then another defensive mistake by the swedes  waeger was allowed to skate around the swedish goal unattacked and from close  range could make it 00 hollenstein then scored 00 on a 0on0 break away  and put it top shelf with no chance for soderstrom   switzerland   goaltender  00 reto

to win against the effective canadians   galley took a slap shot that found dineen by the far post and dineen just  deflected the puck past trefilov in the russian goal then a power play  goal after a couple of deflections eric lindros found kariya alone by the  far post and kariya put the puck high over a sliding trefilov  russia won the shots in the first period 000 and they had the most of  the scoring opportunities but they just couldnt score  second period saw lindros scoring his 00th  goal of the wc kariya  entered the russian zone slammed on the break to get past his defenseman  then made a nice pass to corson who just got the stick on the puck to  deflect it to lindros who onetimed the puck  the russians then finally got their goal karpov broke in from the side  and made a slap shot in tugnutts top right hand corner    player of the game in canada was voted paul kariya and for russia valeri  karpov i agree the difference in this game was lindros and kariya and  in part also tugnutt kariya had a far better game now than vs the swedes  and he was very impressive kariya got the place in the line with lindros  after mike gartner went out with a ribinjury early in the first period   lindros btw lead the point scoring with 00 pts 00 before this game  0 pts ahead of the next player ie double as much as the next player  among those kariya with 00 amazing     group b results

   vzhivovsuperiorcarletonca vladimir zhivov writes game 0 report deleted it bad refing wont affect this  series which should only go two more games all things being equal  wrong  the kings just put on an exibition of hustle team play and consistent  pounding and took it back to calgary with the series tied at 0 games each the final score was 00 with the third goal an emptynetter at 0000 of the third conacher  this is not an official game report just my observations from the stands  0 melrose made a wise decision and put stauber back in goal robb had    something to prove and he did in stopping 00 of 00 while facing a     fierce calgary attack there were numerous highlight film saves  0 kings third and fourth lines rose to the occasion playing rough while    avoiding bad penalties warren rychel scored the gamewinner early in the    second period rookie defenseman alexi zhitnik scored the first from the     blue line late in the first   0 dave taylor is awesome he suffered a broken nose partway through the    second pariod checked from behind into the boards by roberts who got    0 and a game he came back late in the third and was on the ice when    conacher scored the empty netter   actually it was in the third period his return did bring a spark to the crowd and to the players who played awesome defense in the third   0 the kings goto guys still are not producing no goals from kurri granato    sandstrom or robitaille who have a total of 00 points between them   you forgot about gretzky  if any of these guys start scoring the kings will be unstoppable if they continue the great defensive work as well   0 mccreary sucks he called mcsorely for high sticking someone who was already    on the ice and sandstrom for high sticking when he himself was already on    the ice he missed many flagrant stick penalties including one from flame    goalie jeff reese who followed granato out to almost the blue line where he    crosschecked him he called the game very inconsistently with a series of    tickytack penalties in the first and almost none in the third cant the    nhl supply decent officiating  0 i was sitting directly across the ice from ron and nancy reagan when the    empty netter was scored nancy leapt out of her seat with both fists high    in the air way to go nancy   this series is still too close to call tuesdays game may be the deciding one i expect king might put vernon back in even though reese had two good games in la reese has historically been good in la this was only the second time he lost there this move would be good for the kings since vernon is  such a sieve i am sure that stauber will get the call for the kings  stauber will be in net on tuesday  hopefully he will provide another stellar performance and earn the name robb stopper stauber   the firswt two lines of the kings have to wake up while it is great to see you cannot depend on pat conacher and warren rychel for all of your offense i expect sandstrom granato and gretzky might be put back together on a line like they were early in the season this would leave kurri carson and luc as the second on paper these two lines look powerful lets see if they can make it real  i believe this is how they arei know it is gretzky and sandstrom but he has been putting a number of people on left  also the carson robataille kurri line once ignited will light the fire of the other lines hopefully  go kings  dvb     it is evident that the scoring drought is getting to luc after his slight breakaway in the third i think he was steamed on the bench this emotion might help him break his streak  also i have noticed blake has had a few really good chances to score but has fanned or shot wide  is the injury still affecting him     the e     d     g     e  stompkintubacalpolyedu

  in 0000apr0000000000000solctrcolumbiaedu phoenixstartidectrcolumbiaedu ali lemer writes im not even going to bother to reply to your ranting post the letter is  addressed to gary bettman not you he can reply as he wishes  not so  your post is addressed to all  i quote  as she said the letter is addressed to bettman  the post which though having pretty much the same content is an entirely different entity was addressed to all  when she puts the letter in the mail i doubt it will say to all  i figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here  thats an entirely  different purpose than sending the letter to bettman  unfortunately  and i guess i let you know didnt i  you do not represent a large body of hockey fans by any standard you care to use to define large  00 people constitutes nothing more than a tiny  group of fanatics and is in no way representative of a large body of hockey fans on the internet let alone of one of the largest computer networks in  the world   the largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of  the internet not a group as a whole that she claims to represent  as for the business of whether or not it is large it is large compared to say the number of folks on rsh who are sending a letter to thank him for changing the names at least to this point  and just for my own curiosity i thought id look up the official definition of large in the dictionary  it reads  large  0  having more than usual power capacity or scope             0  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size  now i have no idea how many letters bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them  00 people may be up there  thereby validating definition 0  i would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large which would give it a large scope  he might be impressed by the size of the list of names  why would he be impressed with this unless it were large   i am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear yourself speak    i personally dont know whether or not i agree with the letter  i have very mixed emotions about it  i like the names as they are and dont think they make it that difficult to learn the game but there might be a shred of validity to the change      paul w francisco            in the shadow an angel cries catchernetcomcom                       front line assembly  
  again i assume this is not just flame bait by roger but actually a truly held opinion    i would say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that i belong to  and i dont share those views  and i dont believe that the majority of posters on rshockey share those views  and so i have no intention of allowing them to simply go ahead without making my feelings on the subject clear  thanks  for speaking for all those who didnt feel it was important enough to say something themselves    i wouldnt say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that you belong to  it represents a subset that you dont belong to of a larger group which you do if only because this isnt a moderated group  look there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint  three that come to mind are as follows  0 say it subtly  result it may not be clear 0 say it directly yet politely  result probably it will spark some     interesting conversation 0 say it directly and obnoxiously  result validity goes right out    the window  i would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature  you realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be used against you    paul w francisco            in the shadow an angel cries catchernetcomcom                       front line assembly  
   i havent seen any mention of ogrodnick yet in the box scores  does anyone know if hes playing  mike   hes been out but he isnt injured  he played well when he was put into the lineup at the end of the season  murray has to sit somebody out though  if the red wings hadnt played as well as they did in the first game he may have been in the second  why should murray juggle players when the wings are dominating toronto like they are  
   paulfugudataiocom paul brownlow writes   wood played most of his junior career in seattle  he was one of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in 0000  he rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in the whl    wood is fairly small for an enforcertype i mean fleury does a pretty good  job and isnt that large but dody is no fleury   and fleury is no enforcer an agitator for sure but fleury never has and never will have a fight which seems to be what youre saying wood is   the closest fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against los angeles there was a scrum and mcsorley pinched fleurys head under his arm fleury dropped his gloves and gave mcsorley a weak shot to the side of the head mcsorely knowing a good thing when he saw one popped fleury one right between the eyes end of fight fleury got ten stitches for his trouble  the only player i can ever see theo fighting is cliff ronning and even then hed be giving up two inches and 0000 pounds   alan

      i dont think the sharks should dig into the free agent market  most of  the good free agents will require quite a bit of compensation and set the  sharks back as far as player development goes remember the sharks were  unwilling to give up players in addition to the 0 million they offered for  joe murphy and i think thats a good approach  they tried to sign sergei  makarov before this season because makarov wouldnt have required compensation  matching the makarov offer was the only real mistake dave king has made this year i have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 00year old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a 0year 0 million contract  risebrough matched the offer on kings request and makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks not to mention that hes lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes   i think makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract hes ineffective in calgary but he might be able to help a team like san jose with their shortage of talent if theres no takers and makarov doesnt show improvement in training camp i think the flames will just bite the bullet and buy out makarovs contract and release him with his current attitude he is a detriment to the team  alan  
      when you think of the nhl who comes to mind gilmour gretzky mario   ah did i mention mario if you said gretzky you havent really  been following along have you if you said gilmour you are a true  maynard     i dont even think the selection of the hart deserves serious discussion on  this group it is a nobrainer  while i agree that lemieux deserves the hart it is far from a nobrainer  the hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team not to the best player in the league so your above arguement is really worthless   the pens without mario are still a damn good hockey team the leafs without  gilmour would have been fighting tampa bay for the 0rd pick   like i said mario deserves it imho but it is a very close race and a  gilmour victory would not surprise me i dislike doug gilmour with a passion  but i must concede that he is extremely valuable to the leafs  alan  
   i for one am happy about the rangers hiring of keenan  its too bad   that they  didnt hire him when smith fired nielsen maybe he could of staightened   out the  babies on this team and made the playoffs  what this team needs is a   little  fire under their butts    reading through most of these hockey news i dont see many ranger fans   writing     im new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering0000   ranger  fan  but remember suffering builds character    i have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that   last  dreadful stretch    0 knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didnt we   see mike  hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when leetch first   went  down    0 why is joe kocur playing every night  he is not bob probert   who is  tough but also can play    0 how come paul broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of   the  season  at least he plays with some heart and character draws   penalties and  plays 000 when hes on the ice  was he in the doghouse for some   reason    0 joe cirella  enough said    ranger fans may be suffering but were some of the most loyal unlike   islander  fans who only show up when the team wins    as far as the stanley cup goes i think theres only one team that can   test  pittsburgh and thats detroit  this would be the most entertaining and   hard  fought series  mario is amazing    kurt  i think joe kocus should play every night   he is a big physical guy and   he gets the fans into the game with some big hits  both checks and   fists  its a big advantage to get the crowd going  plus he helps   protect the other players  notice there are very few fights when kocur is   on the ice unless he is it  i have seen people start to go after essa   tikkanen only to go slinking away when kocur steps in  i think he is big   asset but should be third line and special situation only play          
  nluxenonstanfordedu nelson lu writes  acquiredc marcus thuresson from n y islanders forrw brian mullen gradei bc  it is not known yet what the impact overall of this trade would be as thuresson is not yet under contract to the sharks and does not appear to be ready to become so anytime soon  mullen meanwhile has had a productive somewhat season with the islanders  thuresson however does not appear to be a big scorer at all if my memory is right he had just 0 points in just 00 games in the swedish elite league in 0000  this season i didnt notice his name frequently at all in staffans reports and he didnt make the national team either it does not appear to be a good sign   marcus thuresson had 0 goals 00 assists 00 points and 00 pim in 00 games  this season for leksand in the swedish elite league this was only 00th  in point scoring for leksand   marcus born may 00 0000 ht 000 cm wt 00 kg is relatively young so he  might still start producing but i think the sharks may have done a bad  trade here   staffan       staffan axelsson      etxonssufsaericssonse  rsh contact for swedish hockey  
  like many others i too was watching the capsisles game when the went to the baseball game  i too was pissed  how could they interupt such an important game  i understand about contracts but you would think they would have a clause in the contract concerning important games anyway  us blues and hawks fans got shafted worse  while everyone in the us and watched the game on abc  however those of us who live in the central illinois area were subjected to watching the arthritus telethon  the area that was most affected by the telecast did not get to see the game except through hawk vision  this game had it been televised would have been the first home hawks game shown in the area since 0000  this television bull has got to stop  we are not only being deprived of seeing games due to skyrocketing ticket prices but we are also being deprived of watching them on tv  peace  hammer    im familiar with the telethon situation an individual on compuserve was also victimized and was equally pissed  that was a local television station contract which could not be broken  for that item i strongly suggest you call that affiliate and vent your anger on them  supposedly one station had told my friend that they have received hundreds of angry calls which will translate into far less incentive to preempt hockey telecasts in future  the contract was written when the pathetic wlaf was in that time slot  tom galvin         galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil   
   okay heres some gripeing griping whatever  i live in santa barbara for reference i think  okay abc showed the kingsflames fine yawn  espn through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the   red wingstoronto game cool  but i swear that the advertisements all week long had said that   espn would show pittnj on tuesday and bosbuff on thursday  i raced home from work early 000 pacific to catch the game but   alas it was the bostonbuffalo game and then they promised that they would   show the pittnj game on thursday  overnight they changed their mind  rest deleted      espn never committed and i never saw advertised to a particular thursday game  they had originally scheduled bosbuf and that was somehow leaked on this net but to my knowledge espn never publicly released a schedule until monday when they announced pittnj thursday and bostonbuffalo saturday  tom galvin         galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil     
  the thing that confuses me most about espn is that they decided to show the  penguins and devils again on thursday night  being that both of the first  two games were dominated by pitt you would think that they would show a  different game  this is in addition to the fact that they should show other  games just for the sake of fair exposure  nesn owns the rights to bruin telecasts  i suspect that nesn was only going to sell one telecast to espn remember espn only owns exclusive rights to the finals not the entire playoffs  since espn bought the sca contract there are less wrangles to untie with showing the devils and penguins   also some of you should know that as far as i can tell espn is not going  to show campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds  i  believe that they are only going to show campbell games in the first two  rounds as those series wear on games 0  0 or perhaps games 0 0 0    i think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it  plus they have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule unless the nhl was willing to make a western club move up their game i think the nhl got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for abc  also does anyone have info on abc coverage for this sunday 000    same exact coverage as last week  pitnj game 0 in the east chistl in the central lacgy in the mountains and west   robert andolina randolinpolisciumnedu   tom galvin      galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil

     bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 00 in   their entire 00year history     which doesnt mean much since the statistics are mostly based on the 0game playoff format but yes it looks dark for the bs what a disappointment     still i think the problem is mental they needed the saves blue came up with perhaps he can offer something to mentally rally around     who do you think gets the start in game three i hope it is going to be blue if the team can rally around him maybe moog can too    jan brittenson    bsongnuaimitedu

  snicholsadobecom sherri nichols writes  of course ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal contributions before he was fired so its not clear that this would have been different  besides they were marginal contributors  lets also not forget that ferreira came this close to trading kelly kisio which if the rumors ive heard are true was over the strong objections of other aspects of shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the threeheaded consensus oriented gm  imagine for a second where the sharks would be today if that fax machine hadnt jammed  on the other hand im hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes fereirra made  imagine indeed but then again we have the benefit of hindsight  lets say that in the view of the sharks upper management the attempt to trade kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire feirerra im inclined to take exactly the opposite view  they should have kept himhes obviously the luckiest man in hockey  wonder what sacrifice he made to the muse of fax  his job i guess  have fun gak   richard stueven       aha 00000  he has erected a multitude of new internet            gakwrscom go offices and sent hither swarms attmail attmailgakhausgak sharx of officers to harass our people cow palace            000h00  and eat out their substance

   terence rokop writes  richard j coyle writes   thats not inner calm  its boredom and its being spoiled  the arenas been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just take winning for granted  its been seemingly forever since the team lost and weve forgotten what its like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory  i dont really agree with this  but it is an entirely different high at any rate  the first cup the pens won i didnt think about anything else i just watched mario and all skate the thing around the ice  now it seems to be more of a question whether or not thirty years from now young hockey fans may there be millions will still ask us what it was like to watch this team  thats what they are playing for now  but i was still as nervous as ever when the devils were blasting shots at barrasso in the final seconds of game three so the fun is far from over yet  im not bored either  most people i know say that winning the second cup was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one but im every bit as excited this year and i am experiencing that inner calm to which susan originally referred  inner calm is not boredom  as far as the arena in general being boring well richards got that right its been that way all season  i attribute it to a lot of new fans who just dont have the same spirit and knowledge as longtime fans  at last tuesdays game i overheard a man express surprise that a goaltender can get an assist  anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen at any time  im confident in the pens but im also not stupid enough to think for one minute that its impossible for new jersey to blow them out of this series  i doubt that will happen but its possible  bored  uhuh spoiled  not in the least  forgot what excitement is like  living through that amazing streak wasnt exciting  i dont take a darned thing for granted  god look at chicago  and i see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway  it isnt gonna last forever and i intend to enjoy it while i can    mom

  cs000000arielyorkuca shawn luddington writes  as for the picks ottawa picks 0 which means it is almost 000 that alexander daigle will  go 0 hell either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec  i dunno about hat i have friends up there on genie who are now saying that ottawas gone soft on daigle and is thinking hard about pronger daigle has shown an attitude the latter part of this season many folks havnet liked and after coming back from his second multigame suspension for being stupid hes really tanked in his performance his stock is dropping like a rock   also remember that a lot of teh draft 0st stuff comes from the assumption hell be traded to quebec for lots of prospects its not clear that  quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current status hes still first round but i dont consider him a first pick lock by any means at this point  its also possible that the senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price since daigle has been taking some lindros lessons during thos suspensions  imo i would take kariya  he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in the world championships  daigle didnt show this for his junior team  san jose will then get kariya  no kariya wont go in the first three for a very simple reason hes not leaving college and i dont believe any of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who wont be around for another year or two not when there is equally good or almost as good stuff available that can make an immediate impact san jose seems to be leaning heavily towards niedermayer for that reason kariya could go 0th or 0th unless a team can convince him to leave school early which i doubt   my cut on things as they stand today  draft order  0 ottawa 00 daigle if not 00 pronger 0 san jose 00 niedermayer unless ottawa skips daigle then its open it depends on if the sharks can get a deal for him i dont believe they draft him to keep him 0 tampa bay whoever ottawa doesnt take or maybe koslov     chuq imho von rospach esd support  training dalaux  chuqapplecom    member sfwa  editor otherrealms   genie macbigot  alinkchuq    minor league fans minorsrequestmedrautapplecom san jose giants a00   san francisco giants fans giantsrequestmedrautapplecom the sticknot    san jose sharks fans sharksrequestmedrautapplecom new seat 000tbd

  joe00pittedu joseph b stiehm writes    come on boston where the hell are you seven wins in a row and what choke  ah well another brian sutter team is ground into the dirt with intensity during the regular season and then is burned out by playoff time yah fuhr has been awesome so far but really youd think sutter would have learned his lesson about pushing his team too far during the regular season  stuart esrock   bowling green state u   how bout them blues  
  is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad  i cant remember how many times during the penguinsdevils game they showed some guy without the puck being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal  in fact i think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner  now the last time i watched a football game they didnt show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown       is it just me  greg   espn has been trying various things to get away from the followthepuck concept of televising hockey games  one of the main problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything that is going on  more happens away from the puck than in any other sport except maybe football and they can do isos on football players to be shown between plays  the problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile other times you get burned  tom galvin        galvinttauruscsnpsnavymil   
  cr000clevelandfreenetedu jim schenk writes    one last point darryl sutter is getting badly out coached by bob berry  the  madder darryl gets the more he reminds me of brian  the hawks are  quickly loosing thier focus i dont think the blues will win in 0 but you  never know  not to sutter bash or anything since i idolized them as players you sure would think the sutters would learn something about burning out their teams in the regular seasonjust too much intensity during the regular  season  i earlier posted a note about brian and got to thinking after i read this itemgee both sutters won their divisions and now both have lost  home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the playoffs  kind of makes you wonder  bottom lineman it is great to be smoking the warthawks agreed jimthis has been damn sweet so far  about the only thing that comes close to this is shutting up all the maple laugh fansdetroit has completely kicked their asses so far  but i will stick with the blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far  stuart esrock  bowling green state u  go you blues  
  with the recent demise of the chicago blawkhawks much to my delight i noticed their 0  game playoff losing streak 0 to the pens last year and now 0 to the blues and i am wondering what the nhl record for consecutive losses is if there even is one  im pretty sure that the hawks have at least a 0 game losing  streak since theyve had to have lost a series since their last championship whenever that was  basically i need something else to rag on my hawksfan friend with   mike the insomniaced  yesrushmarillionemerson lake and palmergenesisdream theater  mike weintraub aka jvi on irc   sig quote du jour   mweintramericanedu            life is like a scissorspaper     jediwavecerfnet               stone game none of the answers    the american university          is always right but sometimes     washington dc                  each one isneil peart rush go philadelphia phillies and vancouver canucks 0 down 00 to go

    have belfour and roenick done another disappearing act at chips are   down time  when i saw them it looked like the blackhawks defense  might carry them along way in the playoffs     well they held st louis to 00 shots in game 0 and lost   looks like maybe keenan had has some insight to me  
    in article 0000apr000000000eaglewesleyanedu  writes  i for one am happy about the rangers hiring of keenan  its too bad    that they  didnt hire him when smith fired nielsen maybe he could of staightened    out the  babies on this team and made the playoffs  what this team needs is a    little  fire under their butts    reading through most of these hockey news i dont see many ranger fans    writing     im new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering0000    ranger  fan  but remember suffering builds character    i have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that    last  dreadful stretch    0 knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didnt we    see mike  hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when leetch first    went  down    0 why is joe kocur playing every night  he is not bob probert    who is  tough but also can play    0 how come paul broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of    the  season  at least he plays with some heart and character draws    penalties and  plays 000 when hes on the ice  was he in the doghouse for some    reason    0 joe cirella  enough said    ranger fans may be suffering but were some of the most loyal unlike    islander  fans who only show up when the team wins    as far as the stanley cup goes i think theres only one team that can    test  pittsburgh and thats detroit  this would be the most entertaining and    hard  fought series  mario is amazing    kurt    i think joe kocus should play every night   he is a big physical guy and    he gets the fans into the game with some big hits  both checks and    fists  its a big advantage to get the crowd going  plus he helps    protect the other players  notice there are very few fights when kocur is    on the ice unless he is it  i have seen people start to go after essa    tikkanen only to go slinking away when kocur steps in  i think he is big    asset but should be third line and special situation only play       this is fast becoming a game without the goons  i admit kocur may get the fans into the game but surely they would rather see broten taking a pass from kovalev and scoring a breakaway goal to put the rangers up 0 magic  goals in the third period rather than seeing kocur take another stupid penalty and the rangers giving up another powerplay goal   the rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure off messier and the first line  nemchinov is a perfect third line center  so who goes beezer or richter  kurt    
  does anyone know if msg will televise any of the binghampton rangers playoff games  even taped replays would be nice     
   rumor has it here in pittsburgh that there is going to be a penguins  broadcasting change before next season  according to the rumor the kbl  leadership the company the broadcasts the pens games wants to limit  loved broadcaster mike lange to radio only and hire don cherry as his  broadcast partner  this would mean paul stiegerwald would be fired  good riddance       does anyone know anything about this  lange is a fun broadcaster to  listen to and pens games wouldnt be the same without him  also i hear  cherry doesnt have high opinions of lemieux ulf sammuelsson or  jaromir jagr  how is he supposed to broadcast their games        i believe that the large number of digits on his paycheck and it would not be binary would help don to be a fan of ulf jaro and mario    nate peters  lifetime penguins fan even from before they were the best  kevin l stamber purdue university top 00 reasons the pittsburgh penguins won the patrick division 0 a strong desire to get the cup back to your neighborhood    eat n park  where theres always something special cooking   
  im personally expecting moog  blue played fairly decent alright spectacular at times in his 00 a game but moog has the experience what did blue have going for him nothing what would happen in a tie game the prssure is then on the goal tender to insure that you keep the puck out at the very least until your team scores  blue didnt face that kind of pressure on tuesday  the bruins will come out storming that is for sure  i really think that this series is up to buffalo boston except for two bad passes in game one really hasnt played that bad   as a believer is statistics you know that your going to get the puck by fuhr sooner or later just keep shooting  there game plan is sound but they need to take the lead first and control the tempo                 imho                       pat ellis  ps  go bruins    go umaine black bears    0000       number 0                     hockey east regulars season champions                    hockey east tournament champions                    paul kariya hobey baker award winner          ncaa div 0 hockey tournament champions                       maine      ggggooooooo    bbbllluueeee

  once again the leafs overcame the red wings in what was possibly the most exciting game played yet in this playoff year  potvin was solid and wendel completely dominated probert  gilmour as usual was the best player on the ice  and to those who claim that andreychuk fades in the playoffs please take note  andreychuk is averaging a goal a game    0 stars   andreychuk  0 goals wendel      all over probert probert     all over everyone else   todd gill also played an excellent game   we cant say enough about doug gilmour  when he is right all is well gilmour brings to mind davey keon from the previous leaf dynasty   predictions so far on track   nyi over buffalo and leafs over la kings   leafs over nyi in the final  i cant let this pass if the islanders get past pitts assuming the isles beat the caps god  willing them im sorry the isles will crush the leafs flame shields up   of course no one asked me i always interject my opinions on matters i have no  concern over   go islanders 0 down 0 to go go jets for 00            cordially as always                      maynardramseycslaurentianca                                             so many morons rm                                                 and so little time

  from matthew rush but hes starting to push it over the edge imho  of course holiks chop to barrassos neck wasnt too sportsmanlike either it seems that he was following the the only way to beat the penguins is to injure them philosophy  its pretty obvious that holiks hitting barrasso was an accident he was even apologizing for it immediately before the penguins all jumped on him  ralph

  in article randolin0000000000polisciumnedu randolinpolisciumnedu robert andolina writes many people have suggested that fuhrs play is the only reason that the  sabres beat the bruins  while fuhr was a critical factor i would not  overlook the fact that the sabres finally got some scoring from people other  than mogilny and lafontaine khmylev sweeney hawerchuck etc  indeed  lafontaine played hurt and didnt score many goals  also the team played  better defense although not great than in the regular season  fuhr  deserves a lot of credit but not all of it  robert a  i agree with this i also think fuhrs contribution for sabress win is just the same as many palyers in the team mogilny had six goals in four games including two goals for the great comeback in the final win after fuhr had left the key for sabress win over boston is whole teams strong commitment as an underdog and all their talent players including mogilny and fuhr   i think that grant fuhr deserves more credit than that while its true that the entire sabres team played very well i still believe that if it wasnt for grant fuhr the series would now be tied 00 he virtually stole games 0 and 0 for the sabres in both of these games fuhr stood on his head to give the sabres the chance to win especially in game 0 fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 00  even in game 0 when the sabres won 00 the score seemed to indicate that the sabres dominated however if it hadnt been for fuhr the sabres wouldnt have been up 00 i think it was through the 0nd period and the bruins wouldnt have had to open up the game thereby allowing mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game  there is no doubt in my mind that fuhr was the critical factor in the victory   in my opinion neely oates and juneau played as well as lafontaine mogilny and hawerchuk the sabres did get extraordinary efforts from hannan sweeney wood and khmylev compared to that of the bruins checkers however the bruins defense  imo played better than the sabres defense the sabres have ken sutton playing a regular shift afterall  the difference in the series was fuhr who outplayed andy moog   gary  go sabres  
  im a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best i can here in the hockey hinterlands oklahoma  im hoping i can get a reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas  ive been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly the hockey state in the us  so why is the team moving to a city in texas  is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or were the stars really not making a profit  or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging  opinions please   well as a hockey fan i think its terrible its one thing to say hey  lets give a hockey team to cities that dont have one  thats fine its entirely another to say okay lets take a team from a thriving hockey town and move it   of course none of us will ever know the real inside story but from what i know a group of minneapolis businessmen told green repeatedly that they would purchase the remaining 0000  season tickets to get to the 00000 level that green wanted yet he refused every time its pretty obvious that he was determined to get out of minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets thing as an excuse   i was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game and the fans were great people were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the parking lot before the game the attendance was so full as to have sro and the whole atmosphere in the centre was terrific minnesota is hockey usa how the nhl can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond  me i only hope they get a new team soon  just my 000    ali    ali procrastination lemer  i gave nhl commissioner gary bettman a puck columbia university nyc    once he spent the rest of the day trying to  phoenixctrcolumbiaedu     open it  pat williams gm orlando magic  be kind to animalshug a hockey player

  ive been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly the hockey state in the us  so why is the team moving to a city in texas  is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or were the stars really not making a profit  or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging   norman green claims that he has lost money over the last three years that he has owned the team  when he bought the team it seemed kind of obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red before the team started making a profit again  he gave the impression that he was willing to do so  he claimed two years ago that the team needed to average only 0000 fans per game in order to pull a profit but this season the team averaged 00000 fans despite increasd ticket prices  i think the teams attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move  he was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded such as guaranteed season ticket sales cheap rent at the other two arenas in town etc  oh well i guess the bottom line is   green wanted immediate huge returns in dallas and wasnt willing to wait another year or so in mn  dallas gave green a pretty stellar deal to play there although i feel minnesotas was quite reasonable and he also has some cronies down there as well  all this means is that minnesota is without an nhl team for a year or two  too bad for the nhl  kea

  okay the caps again are about to break out the golf clubs but before they do does anyone have the history of the washington capitals futility record in the playoffs i remember that terrys first year was the first year that the caps finally made it to the third round but before under brian i noticed that every other year the caps got to the second round and the years in between they didnt make it past the first round is this trend continuning  the admiral a hopeless caps fan ps we still remember that 0 ot loss to the islanders aurggghhhhhhhhh  admiral steve c liu          internet address admiraljhunixhcfjhuedu 0000 world champions   baltimore orioles  why not  series in the yards          00000000 stanley cup champions   washington capitals            the bangles are the greatest female rock band that ever existed    this sig has been brought to you by frungy the sport of kings      my god man drilling holes through his head is not the answer dr mccoy

  in article 0000apr0000000000000mkscom chuckmkscom chuck lownie writes potvin by the way has played very well  he kept toronto in the game last night during those 0 penalties in the first period by making great saves but they did end up getting to him in the second  the guy has a gaa of 000 in the playoffs and hes played very well hahahahahaa what a joke   did you watch the games          
  in article 0000apr0000000000000mkscom chuckmkscom chuck lownie writes in last nights game toronto received five penalties detroit none  if      which game were you watching  didnt you see the third period when the wings had 0 penalties called on them and then a delayed penalty the leafs had a 0 man advantage for about a minute and a 0 man advantage for another minute or two and the leafs still couldnt score   and i wonder how the leafs scored a powerplay goal if according to you they never had a powerplay   in the detroit paper today it said there were 00 penalties called in last nights game and youre saying detroit had none of those penalties im guessing you only watched the first period i have to admitt the leafs did get alot of penalties in that period where as the wings didnt get many if any at all havent looked at the box scores yet  but the ref more than made up for it in the third period   laurie marshall wayne state university detroit michigan go wings  my apologies for the typo  i meant the wings had 0 power plays in the first period and the leafs none    as well my point isnt that the refs were biased just that they were calling a lot of penalties which works to the benefit of the wings  having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then calling a bunch against the other to make up for it takes a lot away from what could have been a great game           
  what did happen to the swiss team  last year they reached the semifinal and now after 0 matches no points and even no goals  after the 00 against italy it seems they lost any hope and were overrun 00 by the russian team now it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the blevel does anybody know if this wc is the qualification tournement for the olympic games 00 in lillehammer or are some teams already qualified for them  hopp schwiiz            daniel  
  hooray i hear on tsn that the jets have won a game selanne getting a hattrick  of course here in gods country read ontario i couldnt see that game nor any other in the vanwpg series so far because our beloved cbc figures no one out here cares about this series which has looked pretty competitve so far  on monday and wednesday nights cbc could have shown the toronto detroit game done the news then picked up winnipegvancouver they didnt  tonight  you guessed it torontodetroit the news not the end of the jets game then calgaryla  so if its hockey night in canada why cant this ontarian see one of the two series with two canadian teams  is this too much to ask  paul badertscher 000000000uwovaxuwoca   id like to echo these sentiments  this is the worst coverage i can   ever remember seeing on cbc  as soon as the game ends i can count to 00  and by that time theyve signed off the air  no post game interviews  no updating of late scores nothin  tsn is really putting cbc to   shame  i only hope the later round coverage improves i mean who  really wants to see cbc primetime news instead of hockey   my 00   darren     darren reiniger                   reinigerugcsdalca  arishemacdalca  centre for marine geology dalhousie university halifax ns canada  people who wonder where this generation is going should remind themselves     where it came from in the first place                                        
   roger maynard wrote    once again the leafs overcame the red wings in what was possibly the  most exciting game played yet in this playoff year  perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that you have seen  for most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity  it was nowhere near the most exciting game  paul stewart called the single worst game ive seen this year   federovs major was obvious and i dont dispute it  however chaissons  penalty shouldnt even have been a penalty let alone a major and a game misconduct  the 0minute game misc call is for high sticking only  there is no blood penalty  just because  chaisson barely touched the  poor sap and he hit the dasher and bled profusely doesnt mean it is a  penalty   unfortunately the instant replay is not used on hits  at first i immediately thought 0 and a game because the hit looked much more severe from an intenttoinjure perspective than it was  after seeing the replay id say it deserved 00 minutes for boarding it was careless any way you  slice it  if stewart had replay i do not think chaisson would have gotten 0 and the game  in the second period behind potvin probert had the puck and was going to get out front and was tackled  i couldnt believe the nocall  this nocall was bullshit i agree i admire stewart for letting them go but probert looked up saying where the hell is the penalty  ive never seen probert whine either he doesnt need to  now if probie decides to put wendel through the boards hes probably gone right  i dont remember who on the leafs touched the puck  on racines shot towards the end of the game 000 seconds left but stewart called it out of play last touched by detroit  everybody in the garden including the linesmen knew it  yzerman protested but stewart just  laughed and really homered the wings  this was also bullshit  but once again no replay  it was rouse btw im really pissed that the linesmen didnt correct the call eitherits bs when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake    but when it all comes down to it wings played like shit  yes  the calls you describe should not have the difference in a detroit loss  i picked the leafs to win game 0 on emotion and adrenalin but the wings have no excuses for game 0  they should be the superior team  the call that pissed me off the most was anderson getting 0 for putting his stick in somebodys eye  that was the most dangerous stick infraction i have seen in a long time and everybody in the damn league knows hes an asshole when it comes to stickwork  four lousy minutes  bullshit call  murray should send the tape in  or a wing should hammer the living shit out of him   dchhabrastplistsca

  how did the leafs turn it around    i couldnt get the leaf games on the weekend in ca  did the leaf defense wise up overnight did the leafs get in the slot or  was it just fluke goals in a goalie duel  did the wings turn off the jets or muscle   what gives here  i caught game 0 on satellite  i figured my leafs were washed this is a major turnaround   very few predicted this  how how how did it happen     wing and leaf perspectives welcomed   jake    
  in berger000000000chaoscsbrandeisedu bergerchaoscsbrandeisedu writes   ive heard rumors recently from reliable sources that abe polin the  moron who owns the washington capitals is looking to move the team  after this season or next  milwaukee was mentioned as the teams  potential destination  the person who told me this is strongly  affiliated with the nhl and has been extremely accurate in the past  with news of this sort  does anyone know if this is so or has  heard anything of the sort  with baltimores ahl team gone that would  leave the area with only an echl franchise in baltimore not good  thanks       david  why dcbaltimore is one of the top media markets the only thing the nhl seems to care about these days theyve been doing far better than the nba bullets at the gate for the last five years the team has been a perennial contender and fan support has been good to excellent    why should pollin move to city thats five times smaller but has as many teams in other pro sports i dont get it           david  marcu

  finns had to do their best last night when they played against norway in world champs after two periods the score was still 00 this game was  quite much similar to the first game finland played  against france the norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky too in the third period juha riihijrvi scored 00 from a rebound the time was around 0 mins or so the second goal was scored by kari harila who shot straight from a faceoff behind the nowwegian goalie saku koivu the 00yearold center got his first point of this tournament saku koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game prize despite the fact that he is quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater  i think that we will hear from this guy in the future   
  in catcherc000j000fnetcomcom catchernetcomcom paul w francisco writes  as she said the letter is addressed to bettman  the post which though having pretty much the same content is an entirely different entity was addressed to all  when she puts the letter in the mail i doubt it will say to all  i figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here  thats an entirely  different purpose than sending the letter to bettman  and it is a damn good thing that she did post it since she claims to represent people in recsporthockey  unfortunately  the largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of  the internet not a group as a whole that she claims to represent  as  her sole purpose in mentioning the net as steve gallichio has already  pointed out is to lend weight to her points through association with the internet  there is no other reason to mention the internet  this is  misrepresentation and if the internet was a private corporation alison would be leaving herself wide open to all kinds of civil suits  for the business of whether or not it is large it is large compared to say the number of folks on rsh who are sending a letter to thank him for changing the names at least to this point  and just for my  this is not a letter  it is a petition claiming to represent a large proportion of recsporthockey users and by implication a significant number of internet users  00 names can in no way be considered a  large proportion of recsporthockey which while we have no way of counting actual readership is accessible to hundreds of thousands of people  00 persons is no more than a flys fart in a windstorm   own curiosity i thought id look up the official definition of large in the dictionary  it reads  large  0  having more than usual power capacity or scope             0  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size  gee  you looked up large in the dictionary  what next  two syllable  words  now i have no idea how many letters bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them  00 people may be up there  thereby validating definition 0  i would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large which would give it a large scope  let me suggest that the only place you are likely to envy the magnitude of  00 is when you are looking for ways to beef up your iq scores  he might be impressed by the size of the list of names  why would he be impressed with this unless it were large   as i said he might be impressed by the size of the list of names  but  it would have to be considerably larger  but even this definition does not account for the original context from which you lifted this sentence  i personally dont know whether or not i agree with the letter  i have very mixed emotions about it  i like the names as they are and dont think they make it that difficult to learn the game but there might be a shred of validity to the change    well then what the hell is your point  you dont really know if you have an opinion about the hockey issue but you do know that you dont like me   is that it      cordially as always                      maynardramseycslaurentianca                                             so many morons rm                                                 and so little time   
   susan dart writes  amongst penguins fans there seems to be an inner calm that ive never experienced before this year with the pens the players and the fans have so much confidence in the team this year were savoring every game and saving our energy for the stanley cup  thats a good way to put it  its a quiet confidence  i dont feel like i have to defend this team anymore   the devils are a puzzle to me  they have long been one of the few teams i always dreaded playing  their d isnt quite what it used to be but they still usually play us pretty tough  i just cant figure it out  at least last night they mounted an attack  0 watching some of the devils players being interviewed i could    see in their faces and eyes that they really dont have any    confidence they are left speechless when asked what more they    can to do to beat the pens they act as though they know its    a hopeless task  bernie nichols was interviewed after game 0 on the late news  he was shaking his head in disbelief over barrasso saying that tommy is like another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him then he got this faraway look on his face his voice started trailing off and he said it just isnt rightit just isnt fair and he tried to muster a smile  im really impressed with bowmans coaching tactics  hes had an answer for every move that brooks has thrown at the pens  as far as coaching goes a pensislanders matchup should be pretty good  one guy i feel sorry for in all of this so far is chris terreri  im sure tom barrasso knows how he feels  for so long tommy would look up and not have a teammate in sight  terreris teammates really left him out in the cold in the first two games  mom   
  news  for the first time all season the flames are now injuryfree the only player remaining on the limp is center carey wilson who even when healthy is not  a major part of the team   trent yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season game against san jose he potted his first of the year in that game and has also scored goals in both game 0 and game 0 against los angeles   thoughts on game 0   the flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with los angeles 00 on sunday afternoon they seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals they physically dominated the kings but that was the only area they dominated in the game plan was to rush the net and  try and take advantage of a young inexperienced la defence and the shaky kings goaltending but those plans fell by the wayside while the flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box particularily stupid was theoren fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming warren rychels face into the dasher while rychel was on his knees   goaltender mike vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the loss despite his wellpublicized poor record in afternoon games he got very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and  sweeping away rebounds in fact marty mcsorleys goal actually went in off chris dahlquists skate in front of the net   thoughts on game 0   the flames came back strong in the second game evidently aware of the potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice the first period was fairly even with the edge going to the kings but calgary came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the kings scoring five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 00 win   the deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams calgary dominated on faceoffs as they did in game 0 but they were able to make better use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one calgary also went 0for0 on the powerplay while la only went 0for0 and gave up a shorthanded goal to joel otto las powerplay goal also came late in the game with the outcome already decided the kings powerplay failed them when they needed it most in the 0st and 0nd periods   the flames lost rw greg paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he was leveled by alexei zhitnik right after scoring calgarys 0th goal charlie huddy left the game for the kings with a groin injury   the game was marred by stupidity in the last minute first craig berube of calgary took a fiveminute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for instigating when he went after tony granato for no apparent reason granato drew a minor for some strange reason turtling perhaps this was followed 00 seconds later by warren rychel drawing a major minor and game misconduct for hitting frank musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a fight musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason hardy and yawney went toetotoe and both got double minors gregson thought that musil  turtling amounted to fighting but that yawney and hardy throwing punches at  each other was just roughing wheres this guy from   upcoming games  friday april 00 at la sunday april 00 at la tuesday april 00 home to la  thursday april 00 at la if necessary

  in 0000apr0000000000000alchemychemutorontoca golchowyalchemychemutorontoca gerald olchowy writes  so whats stopping pocklington from going to a bank and borrowing 00 million dollars to pay off his treasury branch loansi was reading  according to the recent tsn report peter puck is not paying any interest on the treasury branch loans  thats a lot of green  somewhere than pocklington business have gross revenues of about 000 million per yeari dont think he would have much problem borrowing from his visa to pay off his mastercard if he wanted to  again according to tsn virtually everything that peter puck has already  has liens against it  of course we cant really be sure of this   pocklington is at the point of maximum advantage right nowand he is basically right in that northlands which is a creature of the city of edmonton must give him a better deal in the era of escalating salaries  northlands and the city benefitted as much as he did during the eighties from the oilersand wealth generated by the oilers success was sharedbut the finanical viability of small market teams has radically changed in the space of a couple of years and for the oilers to remain viable and competitive they need much more of the revenue stream from concessions parking and building advertising as most every other professional sports franchise in north america has  what was once a fair agreement that shared the wealth is now northlands sucking the blood out of the oilers franchise  the oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is that a deal is a deal  sather has spouted this repeatedly  pocklinton has a contract with northlands until 0000  a deal is a deal  perhaps if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets players such as gretzky and the income he has received in expansion fees with his revenues he wouldnt be losing money  he has admitted pulling this money out of the oiler franchise to put into his other businesses   the oilers have paid several times over what the coliseum cost to build and bring edmonton prestige and recognition throughout the world that is essentially pricelessto nickelanddime the oilers just so northlands can use revenue sucked out of the oilers to  subsidize their horseracing operations is insanity  i think that pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization   i cant really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but  he is certainly not entitled to it  pocklington has sucked revenue out of the oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests pocklington is not to be trusted  i doubt very much that any oiler team will ever again make the playoffs under pocklingtons stewardship as soon as a player shows himself to be a competent nhler and expects to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or draft picks      cordially as always                      maynardramseycslaurentianca                                             so many morons rm                                                 and so little time   
  detroit april 00  most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the detroit red wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to  another easy victory over the best team in the nhl   for the best goaltender in the world felix potvin six was a bad number as he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse to the goon tactics employed by the inferior red wings team   alan  ps we told you this would happen roger didnt we i love it  
   in article 00apr00000000000000vm0mcgillca jbe0 jbe0musicbmcgillca writes aargh  paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the nhl he called a total of 0 penalties on the habs and one on the nordiques the nords penalty came in ot  stewart being an exnordique himself was looking to call penalties on the habs while letting the nords get away with murderwe was robbed  if my powerplay was as bad as montreals id be thanking stewart for calling as few penalties as possible quebecs powerplay is lethal and it is to their advantage to have a penaltyfilled game where they can clean up with their superior powerplay   montreal really lost that game and game 0 because patrick roy is well on his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs the man is truly overrated quebec has scored six goals on roy and four perhaps five  were quite stoppable   alan   
   what is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus wc  i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev zubov and andersson for  binghamton but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play  for springfield while nylander wanted to play for sweden the whalers allowed  the nhl to decide and the nhl chose the wcs how does this differ from the  rangers and oilers did the whalers have to go through the league or could  they have forced nylander to play in springfield  as long as a player is under contract to an organization he is obligated to play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission to play the rangers are certainly within their rights to force zubov and andersson to report to binghampton   it certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the ranger  organization however is having binghampton win the calder cup really more important to them than keeping their players happy   alan  
  and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded  resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other  team captain trivia would be appreciated  brad mccrimmon was the captain of the flames when he was traded to detroit following the 000000 season this was during the offseason though  theres countless examples of captains being traded im sure  alan

  hi guys  what happened 0  potvin didnt let six goals by 0  wendel and andreychuk woke up 0  home ice and lots of yelling in the gardens gave the leafs the emotional edge 0  refs calls especially last night tended to favour leafs  a couple of comments  0  on gilmour  just because the guy isnt one of the three stars doesnt mean he was not leading the team  someone posted the playoff point total and hes in something like fifth or sixth placeplus he walked away with the molson cup given for accumulating points from the three star selection during the regular season  0  on the officiating  ive heard gripes from both ends on this one  emotions are very high in this series  the rivalry is one of the stronger ones i know of  i do have to agree that the officiating last night was proleaf in general except for whoever missed that slash on gilmours hand  0  in general  i still think detroit has one of the better chances vs pittsburgh though i think the leafs would do better against the bluesbut not as well if they made it out of the division problem is i like both these teams though im supporting the leafs on the underdog principle  d  by the waygilmour tiring out is a lot like bob probert not playing aggressive hockey by the wayim not any sort of expert nor do i claim to be i just like watching a good matchup   tee hee heeooops susan

  while i will first congratulate the blues for their victory i think it must be realized that the primary reason the blues were able to win was curtis    joseph  when a goalkeeper gets hot there is little an opposing team can do joseph should be given the entire city of st louis because otherwise there  would probably be a game 0 scheduled    as for the game on sunday  the blues caught a few breaks without a doubt one was the referee constantly watching the blackhawks looking for reasons to give them penalties  second the blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the blackhawks attempted to clear  no linesman no shot for bretti can redirect anythinghull to redirect  on another of st louis goals belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didnt belong in the crease which means it was a st louis player finally the overtime goal was caused because someone kept belfour from getting back to the crease  no goalie no way to stop the shot  i congratulate st louis for beating the hawks  it will be a shame to see bryan murray finally advance to the campbell conference finals because joseph wont be able to stop the powerful red wing attack    the world reknown jason boskey            mail boskuiucedu             known throughout the world as the bosk   christ you know it aint easy all rights reserved all lefts enhanced  you know how hard it can be     the way things are goin         here they come spinning out of the turntheyre gonna crucify me

   i dont think hes shown that hes good enough to carry detroit to the cup the team may be good enough to reach the finals but cheveldae is their  achilles heel  you must have goaltending in the playoffs and  cheveldae looks like an overmatched 0nd or 0rd stringer which he probably    i guess i dont know of too many 0nd or 0rd string goalies that could post  over 00 wins in a season  chevy has done that the past two seasons playing   behind a defense that is not exactly the best in the league  his 00 wins   this year were not all against toronto and for those who look at vincent rien  stats and think he should be starting take a look at the teams he played  against teams like san jose ottawa and tb any nhl goalie could post a decent  record playing teams like that night in and night out   is  look for detroit management to remedy the situation in the offseason    i really dont see this happening  if they didnt think cheveldae could do the  job they would of traded for somebody this year after all why wait until next  year when there were goalies available this year   hey i may be wrong but after watching him kick rebound after rebound into the high slot i dont think he can carry them in the tough games ie those not against toronto    better to kick out rebounds than to let goals in  if st louis gets past chicago watch for joseph to carry the blues past an otherwise vastly superior red wings club   joseph is hot but so are the wings  they have scored six goals in both of  their games so far with toronto supposively one of the leagues best defenses  i guess if they end up playing for the norris title well see what happens       drd the devils advocate        drinkin  women  guns dont mix  v000p0nkubvmsccbuffaloedu  awkorbutacsubuffaloedu                       mark arm      kcs    wings in 00 or hopefully by 00   as far as cheveldae is concerned he is a decent goalie  the most logical trade in the offseason to me would be between detroit and ny rangers  im sure if beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his roots in detroit  he would be a valuable asset to the wings and perhaps the rangers could get a zombo in return  beezer got a few good years in him and the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play

    did anyone see the montreal  quebec game yesterday  it was tight right down to the last second of the third period  in the overtime roy and hextall played like they were gods   ok so montreal won  they deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick  their second goal in overtime was also replayed but i could not tell if it was the montreal player who kicked it in  the puck definitely was not directed in by a stick anyways montreal is back into the series                                                        dave vergolini                                                 michigan state university                                                 vergolineulerlbsmsuedu  
   im just wondering where all the bruins fans are  i mean they woofed it  up with about 0000000 posts during the regular season saying that their  fave team was going to kick everyones  in the playoffs and win the stanley  cup  while i see nothing wrong with a little ranting and raving im just  curious why all the boston faithful have stopped posting  i mean i havent  even see just one little boston fan post cept for the bruins fans that  arent cocky  well maybe theyre all out on the golf course or something  but i dont know id sure like to see where all those bruins fans are at      robbie po           0000s streakers   we do what comes naturally  patrick division semis   pgh penguins  you see now wait for the  penguins 0 devils 0     0000 0000 stanley possibility dont you see a  penguins lead 00       cup champions   strong resemblancedg 00   here in the middle of connecticut there are plenty of bruin fans many who have let me know in no uncertain terms that the rangers choked down the stretch  i think the bruins are doing the same exact thing the rangers did theyre playing too tight  whos responsibility is it to check mogilny  he has gotten off a number of quality shots on goal of which there are many rebounds which are not being cleared by the bs defense  its too bad the bs might not get the opportunity to play pittsburgh again  i would really enjoy seeing ulfie get beat up by neely  we all hate ulfie but would love him on are team

  c liu says okay the caps again are about to break out the golf clubs but before they do does anyone have the history of the washington capitals futility record in the playoffs i remember that terrys first year was the first  dont give up so soon  a lot of burgh fans didnt give up at 00 last year you gotta believe  hard as that may seem  with the caps with the 0 power play in the playoffs and 0 penalty killing according to mike lange all the caps have to do is make sure it doesnt go otas that was bostons and chicagos demise  ot can be a curse   
  good point  there havent even been any recent posts about ulf  secretly im convinced that hes responsible for the bs being down 00 to buffalo somehow  
    ok buffalo fans  i am a red wings fan but am amazed at how the sabres are beating up on the bruins  is there any reason for this  is it grant fuhr or mogilny and lafontaine  i would like to hear from you since i do not know much about the sabres                                                      dave vergolini                                                 michigan state university                                                 vergolineulerlbsmsuedu  
    id like to echo these sentiments  this is the worst coverage i can  ever remember seeing on cbc  as soon as the game ends i can count to 00  and by that time theyve signed off the air  no post game interviews  no updating of late scores nothin  tsn is really putting cbc to  shame  i only hope the later round coverage improves i mean who  really wants to see cbc primetime news instead of hockey   my 00   darren  this was a concession to mansbridge and cbc news they argued that if youre going to play  havoc with the schedule you should  at least make sure that prime time is aired as soon as possible news got a commitment that the postgame show would be scrapped and that the network would go to ptn within one minute or so of the game  ending  as for the earlier comments about cbc being ontariocentric frankly the no doubleheader decison goes both ways people in the west cant  see the leafs  and people in central canada cant see the jets game the reason for the decision was cbcs feeling they couldnt sell advertising for six hours of hockey in  one night   as for who wants to see news over hockey a lot of people cbc always gets plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule       darren reiniger                   reinigerugcsdalca  arishemacdalca  centre for marine geology dalhousie university halifax ns canada  people who wonder where this generation is going should remind themselves   where it came from in the first place   
    there was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams no matter ow bad they are thats bullshit anyone who would follow the pens or the pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are losers its ok to follow and be concerned about your home team but to  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true fana  true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team  when i visit pittsburgh ill refuse to go to a pirates game since i think the management has given pittsburgh a team which could have been much better even if they couldnt sign barry bonds lerts say the pens start doing to their own team what the oilers have done this year and what the whalers have done in recent years i would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the team ill still follow it and bitch about it but i wont waste my money on mediocre teams  pravin ratnam

    oh yeahand i can go to the arena and see not one not two but six championship banners hanging from the rafters  0 stanley cup banners and 0 avco cup banners  my nhl guide says that vancouver has won the cup once as many times as the rockin town of kenora has won it  dont let this confuse anybody  the winnipeg jets have never won the stanley cup or even come that close  these stanley cup championships go back a long way to about the turn of the century  the winnipeg victorias won one or more of these cups the jets didnt win any of them  can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff series going on today than who won more stanley cups around the turn of the century  lets face facts  the canucks are leading the series 00  the canucks dominated the jets in their season series  the canucks did better in the regular season than winnipeg  who is the better team  i think that the facts show that vancouver is better than winnipeg  gregmeister  
  watch out pitsburgh here come the isles    they said we wouldnt make the playoffs and we came in third they said the caps would beat us and theyre not going to they say that pitsburgh has a 00 ratio of winning the cup but well prove them wrong   l e t s   g o    i s l a n d e r s  bring it back home

  ua000freenetvictoriabcca tom moffat says  if the oilers move to hamilton what division will they play in   and wont they have to change their name to the steelers or something the only significant deposits of oil around hamilton are those caused by the tire fire a  few years back  then again if the nba can have the utah jazz or the la lakers think about it what lakes are in la then i guess the nhl can have the hamilton oilers

  shim a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best i can   here in the hockey hinterlands oklahoma  im hoping i can get a   reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas  shive been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly   the hockey state in the us  so why is the team moving to a city in   texas  is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or   were the stars really not making a profit  or was the city or whoever   owned the arena doing some price gouging  shas much as id like to see the nhl only a 0 hour drive from me i   cant help but feel for the people in minnesota unless they truly   didnt support the team  shopinions please  i used to work for the stars  minnesota supported the team to an extent  when i was there we had quite afew sellouts this was the season after the cup run and during the finals  norms main bitch was that there wasnt enough luxury suites  and the ones he had were not always full  he wanted more boxes and wanted them full  he was just asking for too much from people that could go and see other hockey games at high schools for 0 or college for about 00 that would probably be better  mark   þ qmpro 000 000000 þ radioactive cats are very very hot    origin origin line not defined in goedit 00000000  
  here is something crossposted from the ahl mailing list  in a discussion between me and chris lerch the subject of springfields  0st round upset of the providence bruins came up chris basically raised the possibility that the ahl  hierarchy is biased in favor of the indians he noted that the offices for the league are in spring and many exindians are working for the ahl furthermore he also informed me that back a few years ago in the cup  finals between roch and spring that the amerks charged favoritism by the office and that  there were little questionable things liket he ahl president and staff attending all games with the springfield brass including sitting in their box for the game in springfield and according to the rochester media openly cheering for springfield  certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this is true i dont know if this is anything more than whining on the part of the amerks they have pulled this sort of crap against the wings before but if true this is somthing that seriously raises questions about president jack butterfields leadership  btw this was posted with the permission of chris            bri farenellfarenebtcraftcampclarksonedu         ahl ecac and boston bruins contact for recsporthockey         adirondack red wings calder cup champs 00  00  00  00         clarkson hockey ecac tournament champs 00  00  00         glens falls high hockey ny division ii state champs 00  00             ahl fans join the ahl mailing list ahlnewsrequestandrewcmuedu        
   this comes indirectly from al morgani who works in the studio for espn hockey  the management of espn was reluctant to leave the pittnj game  even though the outcome was certain because of fear of the washny game  going to overtime  when the caps scored with 00 left to tie the game al said he heard many people say fk    espn is under contractual obligation to show baseball and could not broadcast the ot of the hockey game  next year espn0 will be introduced so  baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey  get off espns back and stop posting articles on this subject there have been to many fn complainers about this game that its making me sick  geoff filinuk

  caldwell0000mtroyalabca writes   detroit april 00  most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the detroit red wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to another easy victory over the best team in the nhl  for the best goaltender in the world felix potvin six was a bad number as he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse to the goon tactics employed by the inferior red wings team                                                                  alan  ps we told you this would happen roger didnt we i love it            where is roger anyway  havent heard from him in awhile  he must be out on the golf course waiting for the leafs to join him any day now         laurie marshall wayne state university detroit michigan go wings  
  roots in detroit  he would be a valuable asset to the wings and perhaps the rangers could get a zombo in return       wake up and smell the norris  rick zombo was traded to the blues for vince riendo sp last season     mike     
    as far as cheveldae is concerned he is a decent goalie  the most logical  trade in the offseason to me would be between detroit and ny rangers  im sure  if beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his  roots in detroit  he would be a valuable asset to the wings and perhaps the  rangers could get a zombo in return  beezer got a few good years in him and  the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play    only problem is that zombo was traded to st louis last year for goalie vincent riendeau  i think that while chevy is not among the elite class of goalies he is adequate given the offensive firepower of the wings  greg  
  grogersslacvxslacstanfordedu greg rogers writes  hi all  due to living in the bay area i as unable to see vancouvers victory over the jets last night  i know the score but that rarely describes the game could someone please post a brief sonapsis sp of waht happened  how well did each team play  were the cannucks deserving of the victory       well in my opinion the canucks played a really strong game i was especially pleased by a very strong game from linden  i think he could be a key to success for them this year  defensively they really had a strong game  hardly heard selannes name all night craven also played one of his best games since coming over  with a few exceptions they really didnt let the highflying jets do much highflying  i thought the jets defence looked overmatched by the canucks forwards  they will have to improve on that if they want to make this a series      in short it was a great start    chris roney  email chrisroneysfuca  
  the jets gave the canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as vancouver outscored winnipeg 00 the pattern of the first game was repeated tonight with the canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period only to stave off a jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent the jets looked more dangerous in this one but it didnt make a difference in the  numbers that counted goals vancouvers big line produced again with centre cliff ronning and left winger geoff courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to  boost the canucks to a 00 lead on giveaways by the suspect jet defence of bautin and ulanov mental lapses by the defence and goalscoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three canuck goals however as in the first game the jets worked hard to take the game to the canucks in the second period the jets dominated the second checking hard and penetrating the vancouver zone without being challenged by a canuck team that wanted to pack it in early  the hard work paid off late in the second when tie domi caught vancouver goalie kirk mclean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score 00  domis goal gave the jets new life as they began to take the rush to the canucks collapsing defence the canucks were unwilling to do  anything but let mclean take shots and clear the rebounds the jets were allowed to set up and make plays both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably mclean made three great saves in the second off a dancing teammu selanne while essensa was rocked by a pavel bure drive selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the jets pressed a series of attacks into the canuck zone the canucks on the other hand looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead a series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the jets in the early third the jets tempo numminen drove a puck from the point through mcleans legs and into the net to tie the game at 00 the canucks discordant play picked up where it left off this was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the jets and individual rushes into a tight winnipeg defence that were never supported however as in the first and second canuck goals a jet defensive lapse re bonehead play stalled the winnipeg comeback with the faceoff in the winnipeg zone pavel bure was left to stand in the crease with no jet defender anywhere near him bure who had been invisible in the game up to that point took a rebound and managed to roof it with a  backhand even though he was off balance  by then it was too late for the jets to come back essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack canucks 0 winnipeg 0 next game is friday at winnipeg with the jets in the hole by two games  00
