  thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and i am looking at using a couple of the ideas i recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil spec version of exars xr0000 timercounter chip it is stable down to 00 c and sucks very little power they show an application for a ultralong time delay up to several years depending on the rc time constant in this application they have two of them cascaded together the reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled in this configuration the output is high when the system is reset when triggered the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 00000 x the timing cycle of the first chip the total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from to  000 x r x c to 00000 x r x c in 000 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output the beauty of it is the timebase chip would only have to have a 000uf timing cap and a 000k resistor for 000 seconds per timing cycle so i can get a maximum of 00000000 seconds between timing cycles 000 x 00000 or about 00 days  of course thats much more than i need 00 days but the counter allows for 000 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the pellet puker after the first 00 days and it trips it would reset its self for the next 00 day timing cycle and so forth  power is still a problem though a few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow as an insulator and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack i like that idea  this thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 00 volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow anyway i ordered the xr0000s to see what i can do with them should be interesting as long as im not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of antartica freezing my buns off   thanks again everyone   wes

   i have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design  what i am looking for is a stable ultralong solid state timer what they want  to do is to place this thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount  of snow fall over a period of six weeks every two weeks they want to trip a  selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the  snow then by digging down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measured  as they come to the different color pellets    the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold 00 degrees  and a power source that wouldnt drain i have looked at the xr0000 timers and  the standard ne000 dual timers but thier temp specs wont go that low also  two weeks equates to 0000000 seconds per firing which means one big timing  cap  i have found 00 farad yes farad  caps that have a working voltage of  0 volts and are small in size but again the time of discharge at 00 or lower  degrees isnt linear i was thinking of using several timers chained together   to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period but that blasted cold and  the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain one possibility would be to  use solar panels but this is during the six month twilight anyone have any  good ideas     thanks in advance     wes   firstly i would never consider trying to make a oneshot timer your 0f0 cap will have been designed as a ram battery substitute rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current their performance in some respects is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap the other point is that big electros are usually rated with 000 tolerances so calculating exactly what capacitance you have particularly when considering the cold  you should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain that rolls over from zero to maximum count or viceversa once every 0000000 seconds if you were to use something like a 000hz clock you would need a divider chain of 000 to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period of course you could trim the 000hz oscillator to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at 00 is low anyway  i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit  caveat  im not experienced in low temperature electronics so i cant guarantee that this or any other approach is the best for inhospitable conditions  johnh                                         electronics department                            school of mpce                macquarie university                                                   sydney australia 0000      email johnhmpcemqeduau ph 00 0 000 0000 fax 00 0 000 0000

  hi     ive just built a valve preamp and use a diodecapacitor voltage multiplier to step the 00vac supply voltage up to approx  000vdv as the load resistance increases the rc constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops i need as high an output voltage as possible about 000v   the circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages ie 00 diodes and 00 capacitors each capacitor develops about 00v across them and i take the output from across seven capacitors000v   each capacitor is 000mfd at 00v  if i increase each of the capacitors rating 000000mfd that will increase the rc constant and hence alleviate some of the problem these capacitors are going to be a little expensive as i need 00 of them so  0 what would happen if i connected a 000mfd at 000v capacitor in parallel  with the output and hence in parallel with the seven 000mfd capacitors   will it as i assume increase the c in circuit and hence increase the rc time constant if it does and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this then i will have killed two birds with one stone as i am experiencing some 00hz ripple and hence amp hum and this new capacitor will smooth this out  and 0 can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor choke to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 00hz mains hum lowest resistance possible     ive not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is too much of a distraction im at university and ive got to get my  dissertation finished in two weeks  hence im mailing not playing with my solderoing iron itll be cheaper too in the long run especially if 00 new large capacitors dont work as planned  email please cant always read the net  thanks in advance   chris        name  mr chris smith            twang on that ole guitar           addrs scst00ukaclivcsc                                           uni   liverpool university quest to build more and more hardware    dgree computer science                                                  what ever the sun may be it is certainly not a ball of flaming gas    dh lawrence    all views expressed are my own and reflect that of private thought

    telephone systems have the capability of a passband of 00hz to 0khz  the reason they do not implement this is it is not backward compatable  to every telephone system  in addition the most effecent mix of   electrical effecency and intelegability closly mateches a 000hz0khz  passband  close but no banana to paraphrase garfield the reason 0000000 hz is used is that voice channels used to occupy 0khz bands when multiplexed on a trunk line therefore 000hz at the bottom and 000hz at the top of this band were filtered to minimise interference with the next band  nowadays digital trunks have made this less relevant but the phone companies still see no reason to improve quality especially for free therefore digital chunk of a trunk segments still have a guaranteed bandwidth of only 0khz so they can carry the equivalent of one analog line at the clock rate of a standard pcm t0 or e0 digital trunk  its all historical   here in the uk the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to  local lines ie those used by the average domestic client private lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are  usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital  dont quote me on that but i think i remember a bt engineer  saying something to that effect when i was doing some work shadowing a few years ago  byeeeee    chris        name  mr chris smith            twang on that ole guitar           addrs scst00ukaclivcsc                                           uni   liverpool university quest to build more and more hardware    dgree computer science                                                  what ever the sun may be it is certainly not a ball of flaming gas    dh lawrence    all views expressed are my own and reflect that of private thought

   du writes i have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design what i am looking for is a stable ultralong solid state timer what they want to do is to place this thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six weeks every two weeks they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the snow then by digging down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measured as they come to the different color pellets  the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold 00 degrees and a power source that wouldnt drain i have looked at the xr0000 timers and the standard ne000 dual timers but thier temp specs wont go that low also two weeks equates to 0000000 seconds per firing which means one big timing cap  i have found 00 farad yes farad  caps that have a working voltage of 0 volts and are small in size but again the time of discharge at 00 or lower degrees isnt linear i was thinking of using several timers chained together to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period but that blasted cold and the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain one possibility would be to use solar panels but this is during the six month twilight anyone have any good ideas   thanks in advance   wes   just a suggestion take a motorola mc00000b set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten secs with either a rc or xtal clock input then feed to a mc00000b as clock input and decode output for 0000000 sec output might have to add a few and gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the000 to restart cycle trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge the one shot then goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher these ckts require uamps of currentbetween 0  00 volts so a 00 volt gel cell of a few amphours would last the six weeks then take the ckt board  battery wrap in 0 or 0 of foam or build a box of out of the stuffwith plywood or metal exterior build a small heater out of 0000 watt resistors in series to keep the battery and ckts warm 0nd thought use 0 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger  insolateinsolateeven though the chips state that the  al rated devices are good to 00 c the batteries have a considerable reduction in capacityoh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage  hope this helps rw      is this to long winded for the netbe gentle

  situation sometimes called block sync  you can generate such a combined or composite sync in two simple ways  or the h and v syncs together which gives you the nonserrated block sync or exor them which makes serrations  try it  actually the exor doesnt really do kosher serrated sync since it puts the rising and falling for that matter edge of the h  sync pulse off by a pulse width  but that usually makes no difference  sometimes  it depends on your monitor and your timing  if you dont have enough vertical front porch and you use xor composite sync you can get evenodd tearing at the top of the screen which is very sensitive to the hhold control  it looks like what you would expect if you scanned the even fields say onto a sheet of mylar and had pinched the upper left corner with your fingers and started to tear it off the tube  with proper composite sync equalizing pulses the interlace is rock solid       ii      cccccc   jim cathey  ii  sssscc       iscbunker ramo  ii      cc       tafc0  spokane wa  00000  iissss  cc       uucp uunetiscbrjimc jimciscbriscbrcom  ii      cccccc   000 0000000  one design to rule them all one design to find them one design to bring them all and in the darkness bind them  in the land of mediocrity where the pcs lie

    from what i understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive device much like the radio in your car  they work as an antenna picking up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out  therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car     from my rather rusty knowledge of radio most radio receivers use a superhet  circuit so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator giving  a fixed intermediate frequency if that is more easily amplified the detector detectors work by picking up if reradiated from your radar  detector in britain where one hasused to pay for a tv licence there  arewere tv detector vans prowling the streets looking for people who hadnt  paid their licence fee they had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof and i believe could triangulate an operating tv from the if   i wonder how much of the if is radiated back from the detector antenna and  how much from the rest of the module it might be worth putting the detector  in a proper rf shielded enclosure    andrew daviel vancouver canada advaxtriumfca   finger advaxregtriumfca for pgp key  
   i just heard an unbelievable rumor that motorola has decided to drop their  integrated circuit manufacture business  apparently a digikey rep called   one of our production coordinators for out information so that we could  make plans to deal with this that moto was getting out  anybody else  get a call about this    too much for me  its about like intel announcing they were getting out  of the ic business   this rumor didnt happen to appear on april 0st  if this digikey rep was serious i think i will buy my parts elsewhere if that is the way they do business you cannot trust them  mark

  heres a question for all you electrical engineers out there    i bought an infrared detector module at radio shack for 000  it is a  little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal then i hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared led the circuit works like a minature remote control extender in my car  all remote commands are relayed to the cd player hidden in the glove compartment it works fine with my denon cd player but when i tried to build the same circuit for a friends vcr it didnt work   the circuit appears to work for other remotes you can see infrared with a sony ccd camcorder but coincidentally it only seems to work for my cd player  any advice would be appreciated         brian   ubsiler  msuvx0memstedu   
   i agree  i come at this from nuclear physics where one often discusses  particlehole excitations and certain reactions have the effect of  applying an annihilation operator and creating a hole and it is a  subtle question  the longer one works with them the more real they  become  there are also quasiparticles which raise the same sort  of question about how real the entity is  the phenomenon is most  certainly a real one   ok ive asked this before and with a new thread on these lines i ask this again  0 if a large hole current is run thru a resistor will there be    i0  r cooling instead of heating  0 can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies    hole currents over normal electron currents  0 what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of    hole mobility to electron mobility please quote actual    test samples rather than estimates based on theory also    dont be limited to semiconductors consider also insulators    resistors dielectrics piezoelectrics conductors    magnets metal ceramic magnetostrictives etc  notes     to summarize this thread has so far stated that the only area    where holes are not detectable is the vacuum that is hole    particles only exist in the presence of matter    previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain    semiconductors the question that naturally arises is if    the hole currents inside a semiconductor vanish at the point    where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor say copper    i dont want a theoretical discussion here about whether    holes could exist inside metal conductors rather i ask for    an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such    currents if they exist    also note that i have crossposted this to scielectronics    since this is now becoming an electronic discussion  thanx eric    et   a force of nature

   as for adcoms mobil they are going with amps that canb use balanced inputs a very nice toy but im afraid its goig to push their amps beyound resonable price ranges  especialy because taking advantage of those balanced inputs requires a 000 rca to balanced adapter  umm when i was doing sound reinforcement for a living i used to get direct boxes which convert unbalanced 00 jacks to balanced xlrs for about 00 each or a little more for higher quality youll need two for a stereo signal of course and a little adapter thingy from  radio sht to convert from rca to 00 total cost should be around 00 you can also buy transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself total cost there should be under 00 you can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear the benefit no noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component with the balanced inputs even when you run them in bad places like next to power lines   john bell nasa langley research center bellhopslarcnasagov

   i have a new scope and i thought id save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in after having it awhile i noticed two things about the function generator for one there seems to be a bias even when the pulloffset is pushed in that is i have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 00mv bias the other really annoying thing is that the damn output wont go below about 0v pp i am a student  you may have guessed from my previous posts  and i often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits i buildmany of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 000mv amplitude and most have input impedances in the 00s of kohm range the thing is in order to use my function generator i have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable then of course to measurethe input impedance of my circuit i am going to have to throw in another resistor in series with the 00ohm output of the generator i could just ignore it but now with this little divider there i have to figure that in its kind of a pain in  the ass is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem the box would tkae the function generator input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low unchanging number i would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so i could just build a little buffer amp but id like to have this box not be active any quick ideas the scopes not broken for other reasons i had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it the function generator was the same way on that one too  please help as i am feeling very stupid  today  dave  dgj0yvirginiaedu

  just a shot here but ya never know  i once bought a real cheap equalizer  power amp for my car tape player  at one of those motelroom truckload sales and it sounded great  for a  while that is  then one channel quit entirely  i opened it up and the  amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder  joints attaching it to the pcb  i soldered them back and it worked fine   i just had to keep the volume a bit lower than i did before  probably  lousy heat sinking  you said a nice alpine which im sure is a few orders of mag higher in quality than the pos i had  but the point is  look inside before you scrap it since you occasionally find something you can repair maybe even the same thing i found  good luck  
  im no expert at upss but you said something that made it sound like you didnt realize something  on a typical ups well on ours anyway there is no switchover from ac to dc  all the protected equipment is always running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual  condition of also having them on charge  if the power fails big deal   the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but  theres something like 00 carsized batteries in that cabinet so it  takes a while  if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter why not do it all the time  then thered be no switchover to screw things up and no having to sense the failure fast  just keep the dc on charge when the power is on and itll be there in zero time when you need it  just some ideas  cant guarantee whatll work or not but hope at least some of this helped

  olsenvetmedcvmuiucedu aartolsen writes   i noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the  000 with ground and that on these circuits the ground  wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral white wire  this is contrary to the electrical code and should be fixed  sorry but this is exactly according to the nec  no need to be sorry i blew it on this one  at the main breaker box where there is a thick wire ground leading to the earth both neutral and ground are hooked to this bus  in any other breaker box or an outlet box etc the ground and neutral must not be connected together

    anyone know of any good suppliers of chips one that could have almost any chip i need i dont want to hunt down all the chips i may need so it would be greatly appreciated if anyone knows of a good distributor  thankyou   paul  unfortunately there are not too many retail outlets thatll stock just about every chip made  the stuff they will stock are the ones thatll sell like standard drams 00000s 00000s etcetc ie  i cnat think of any onestopshopping store  the closest you can get is to pick up a copy of byte magazine or the circuit cellar popular electronics and the like and flip through them  distributors like wyle electronics hamilton avnet pioneer electronics etc etc dont normally deal with endusers like ourselves where we only a couple of everythingthey only deal with people who buy by the hundreds or more  each distributor represents and sells a variety of different noncompeting manufacturers  what do i mean by this suppose abc electronics sells intel 00000s  its a pretty good bet that they wont be selling any of amds 000s or viceversa they also can obtain just about any chip you want from a manufacturer they represent  who knows  you might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them but id be suprised if you do  also bear in mind that the 0 or 0 qty prices they will charge you will be much greater than what a mail order outlet will charge  my advice  if youre gonna be designing anything try to stick with offtheshelf stuff  youre going to get stuck if you use too many esoteric parts sooner or later  good luck  aaron

  engp0000nusunix0nussg soh kam yung writes  i understand the need for a ground plane in a digital system however i would like to know if such a ground plane is also necessary in an analog system  note this ground plane will not be connected except at one point to the signal ground  i keep getting conflicting answers over this does having a ground plane in an analog system help reduce noise also my system only deals with low frequency signals up to 000hz only  well one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on what you want the ground plane to do  a continuous conductor is a good  electrostatic shield  do you have signals on your board that need shielding rom other things  this shielding wont do much good for magnetic fields unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded like a faraday cage  the flip side of the coin  if you are working with very high impedances you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems you arent likely to encounter this at 000hz but at 00khz it can be a real problem one that bit me once

    just a thought of mine here   since an onhook line is aprox 0000v and offhook it usually drops below 0   how about an led in series with a zener say around 00v   onhook  led on   offhook  led off   would this work if anyone triestried it please let me know     aye theres the rub  if you draw enough current to light an led the   equipment at the phone company will think youve gone off hook   in the onhook state youre not supposed to draw current    which means you should just use your digital voltmeter you can use an  old vom but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think  theres something wrong with the cable      look guys whats the problem here  if you want a light that goes on when   the phone is off hook all you need it to run it in series with the   line as i mentioned in my previous post  if you want a light that goes on   when the phone is on hook all you need is a voltage threshold detector  if youre going to do the series diode thing which is the easiest just make sure that the led can take the current i cant recall it offhand but its something like 000ma or more  careful now folks also consider the 00vac 00hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phones supposed to ring  even with a simple zener and led setup you might end up with some carbon real quick  whatever scheme you use make sure youve got at least 000vrated components on  the frontend  also remember that if im not mistaken the phone line is a 000ohm equivalent circuit  any current you draw from the 00v or so gets dropped across that 000ohms  thats fine until youre down to roughly 00v when ma bell considers it to be offhook  but dropping it that far down is probably a big nono  the easiest implementation to accomplish the above      tip                 rectifier  resistor                           diode                                                               v                                     zener            resistor                                                                                                                                          v   led                                                                                                ring   this is only a suggestiongo ahead and blow holes in it but you get the idea  choose a highefficiency led so you dont need much current to get it to light up  choose values for the other components as required  aaron   
  im no expert at upss but you said something that made it sound like you didnt realize something  on a typical ups well on ours anyway there is no switchover from ac to dc  all the protected equipment is always running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual  condition of also having them on charge  if the power fails big deal   the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but  theres something like 00 carsized batteries in that cabinet so it  takes a while  if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter why not do it all the time  then thered be no switchover to screw things up and no having to sense the failure fast  just keep the dc on charge when the power is on and itll be there in zero time when you need it   actually its a bit more complicated than thati sounds to me your ups takes in ac rectifies it to dc to charge the batteries and then takes the battery dc and chops it to ac again feeding your equipment  this approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since as you mentioned nothing will know about what happened down the line  another way to do the ups scheme is to use the mains until you lose power and then kick in the battery backup with its inverter to replace the lost power  the problem here is the switchover time and youve got to resync the ac in no time flat  unfortunately most everything is built around the assumption that ac is available so the ups guys have to provide and ac output to be usableya sorta have to make it work with what there already  similar story with our telephone system  it was first invented back in the 0000s  were still using the same damn system media as they did back then  if i have a phone from back then i can assure you itll work on todays phone system  it costs too much to overhaul everyone to a new system so they make it work with what is out there    
  i had a ge emerson 00 color tv for about 0 years and one fine day while we were watching something i doubt if the program was the cause we heard a mild explosion   our screen went blank but there was sound so we thought oh we have special effects on the program  but soon the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the tv the brilliant ees we are we unplugged the tv and called customer service only to be thrown around by please hold i will transfer u to blah blah   finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the tv and got a new one we wanted a bigger one too  after all the story what i wanted to know is is my problem an isolated incident or a common one i recall reading about russian tvs exploding but not here in the us why would the picture tube explode or even smoke  i still have the left over tv set i might dig into it this summer any idea where i can get parts for these things probably will cost more than tv   heh heh heh hehi laugh because i have the same damn tv and it did the same thing  actually it is a goldstar but its essentially the same tv and electronicsjust a different face plate and name  0  fortunately tv tubes dont explode  id think the tv mfrs want to make this possibility remote as possible  if at all theyll  implode and the glass that blows out would be the result of the glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion in any case dont kick it around    0  i fixed the tv after getting a hold of some schematics  it turned out to be a blown 0w resistor feeding the flyback transformer  i guess the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it created burning itself out  i checked to make sure the flyback wasnt shorted or anything first  oh luckily i had a resistor handy lying around that had just the right value for what i needed  i cant see it being more than 00 cents  well needless to say the tv still works today  so go get a set of schematics and have some funjust dont get shocked poking around the flyback   
   i would like to digitize the output of a squid magnetometer range 00 v to 00 v and do digital signal processing in a computer say a macintosh ii or a 000 pc  i would like a good 00 bit adc with good linearity and a high conversion speed at least 00 khz preferably 000 khz  other concerns  0  must i use an adc external to my computer to avoid digital noise      feedback into my sensitive squid electronics  might be a good idea  the resolution you requested is about 00mv in order to get what youve paid for noise level better be lower than that  it is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a pc  before you pay  for a pc card test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave i think there is a sine wave on a cd  digital domain   there are possibly other low thd sources  run the digitized waveform through a fft transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum  thats should give you a good indication of the design thats what i am doing to test a data acquistion system i have designed  i got the idea from maxim data sheet  if you can live with 00 bit resolution i would recommend looking at the max000 from maxim  it is a high speed 000khz complete sampling ad with dsp interface  the input range is  0v and it uses a serial interface which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source  the analog design guide i got from them shows a 000db noise level  they claim a 00db max 00 typ thd  looks pretty good for the 00  0000 pieces  a evaluation kit is available  might want to give these nice folks a call  00000000000 or fax 0000000000 and 000 0000000 ext0000 for application assistance  this assumes that you can build your own das and write your own software hey you can get the max000 as a free sample just by calling the 0000   i would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a mac or pc based adc system  i would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level otherwise you might be throwing out your money  charles cunningham cecimagerllnlgov  k c lee elec eng grad student  i have no connection with maxim except i do in general recommend companies that give samples to students to others  i feel they deserve that for being nice to me

   im considering modernizing some old wiring in my home and  i need a little advice on outlet wiring  several outlets  are the old two prong type without the ground  naturally  the wire feeding these outlets is 000 without the ground  wire  i noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the  000 with ground and that on these circuits the ground  wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral white wire    so  heres my question  it seems to me that id have the  same electrical circuit if i hooked the jumper from the neutral  over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets  whats wrong with my reasoning here    no  no  nooo  the ground green wire is for safety  no current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions  this means that theres normally no voltage drop in it either  it is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire even if youre grounded in some other way at the same time    the neutral white wire is as dave vanderbyl correctly said the return for the hot wire  since current flows in it theres a voltage drop  if you plug a heavy load into a properlywired grounded outlet you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground    they are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel but nowhere repeat nowhere else  well almost  there are strange exceptions for things like subpanels  what you can do if you want threeprong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a gfci outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper  in fact depending on where you are putting your new outlets a gfci may be required  there is a faq on electrical wiring posted regularly to recwoodworking and newsanswers  it goes into great detail on these issues including gfcis and you should probably read it before asking any more questions  ill mail a copy to you append a copy here and will ask the writers to crosspost it here in the future    jamie hanrahan kernel mode systems san diego ca internet  jehcmkrnlcom  uucp uunetcmkrnljeh  cis 000000000

wiring where do i buy stuff    although weve done a fair bit of wiring we are not electricians and we cannot be responsible for what you do  if youre at all uncertain about what is correct or safe dont do it  contact someone qualified  a licensed electrician or your local electrical inspector  electricity is no joke mistakes can result in shocks fires or electrocution  furthermore our discussion is based on the us national electrical code nec and the canadian electrical code cec to the best of our abilities we have confirmed every detail with the electrical code but we dont quote sections simply to keep this thing readable  if you think were wrong we invite you to correct us but please  quote references  the nec and the cec do not in and of themselves have the force of law  many municipalities adopt it en toto  others however do not  check your with your local building department and provincial hydro inspection offices in canada to find out what applies in your area  also your local electrical utility may also have special requirements for electrical service installation  bear in mind too that we say here applies primarily to ordinary singlefamily residences  multifamily dwellings mobile homes commercial establishments etc are sometimes governed by different rules  also note that contrary to popular belief in the us and in some parts of canada canada is not a whollyowned subsidiary of the us  consequently the nec does not apply in canada lots of things are the same including voltages line frequencies and the laws of physics  but there are a number of crucial differences in the regulations  where we can weve noted them flagging the relevant passages with nec or cec  remember that the cec and nec are minimal standards  it is often smart to go beyond their minimal requirements   the nec is a model electrical code devised and published by the national fire protection association an insurance industry group its revised every three years  the 0000 version has been released you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by calling them directly at 0000000000  the code exists in several versions  theres the full text which is fairly incomprehensible  theres an abridged edition which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses and theres the nec handbook which contains the authorized commentary on the code as well as the full text  thats the recommended version  unfortunately theres no handbook for the abridged edition  and the full handbook is expensive  us00 plus shipping and handling   the canadian standards association is an organization made up of various government agencies power utilities insurance companies electrical manufacturers and other organizations the csa publishes csa standard c000 which is updated every two or three years  each province adopts with some amendments this standard and publishes a provincespecific code book since each province publishes its own slightly modified standard it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the csa standard itself  in this faq cec really means the appropriate provincial standard  in particular this faq is derived from the ontario hydro electrical safety code 00th edition 0000  which is in turn based on csa c0000000 00th edition  while differences exist between the provinces an attempt has been made to avoid specifictoontario detail  the appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical inspection offices of your provincial power authority  in ontario its ontario hydro  the ontario hydro book isnt overly fat  its about c00 and includes mailed updates  i hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the equivalent nec publications  dont bother asking in quebec  diy wiring is banned throughout the province   in most places homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring in some theyre not  check with your local electrical inspector  most places wont permit you to do wiring on others homes for money without a license  nor are you permitted to do wiring in commercial buildings  multiple dwellings eg duplexes are usually considered semicommercial or commercial  however many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semicommercial wiring if youre supervised by a licensed electrician  if you can find one willing to supervise  if you do your own wiring an important point  do it neat and well  what you really want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do  after all its your own home and its you or your family that might get killed if you make a mistake  an electrician has time pressures has the skills and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast safe job in this faq weve consciously given a few recommendations that are in excess of code because we feel that its reasonable and will impress the inspector  the inspector will know that youre an amateur  you have to earn his trust  the best way of doing this is to spend your time doing as neat a job as possible  dont cut corners exceed specifications  otherwise the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions  dont try to hide anything from the inspector  use the proper tools  ie dont use a bread knife to strip wires or twist wires with your fingers  the inspector wont like it and the results wont be that safe  and it takes longer  and youre more likely to stick a hunk of 00ga wire through your hand that way  dont handle house wire when its very cold eg below 00c or 00f  thermoplastic house wire particularly older types become very brittle   first theres the obvious  a hammer a drill a few screwdrivers both straight and phillipshead  if youre  lucky enough to live in canada or find a source of csaapproved devices you need robertson square recess screwdrivers 0 and 0 instead of phillips  for drilling a few holes a 00 or 0 spade bit and 00 or 00 electric drill will do  if youre doing a lot or are working with elderly lumber we recommend a 00 drill rightangle drills are wonderful  can be rented and 00 or 0 screwpoint auger drill bits  these bits pull you through so theyre much faster and less fatiguing even in 00 year old hardwood timbers  screwdriver bits are useful for drills expecially if you install your electrical boxes using screws drywall screws work well  for stripping wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinary wire cutters  dont buy the 0 kmart combo stripper crimper and bottle opener types  you should expect to pay 00 to 00 for a good pliertype pair  it will have sized stripping holes and wont nick or grab the wire  it should be easy to strip wire with it  one model has a small hole in the blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals  there are fancier types autostripcut but they generally arent necessary and pros usually dont use them  a pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends in constricted places  dont use these for stripping wire  you will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts  you should have a pair of needlenose pliers for fiddling inside boxes and closing loops but its better to form wire loops with a loop former hole on your wire stripper  more accurate  if youre using nonmetallic cable get a cable stripper for removing the sheath  or do what some pros do they nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a zipper and cut the sheath off  you shouldnt try to strip the sheath with a knife point because its too easy to slash the insulation on the conductors  apparently stanley utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters hooked blades can be used to strip sheath but there is still the possibility that youll gouge the conductors  for any substantial amount of work with armored cable its well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter us 00 hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire or the insulation  threeprong outlet testers are a quick check for properlywired outlets  about 0  multimeters tell you more but are a lot more expensive and probably not worth it for most people  a simple voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulated wire not supplying any devices is extremely helpful they cost about us 00 at radio shack  you should have a voltage detector  to check that the wires are dead before doing work on them  neonbulb version are cheap 00 and work well  if you get more serious a audible alarm type is good for tracing circuits without a helper  though ive been known to lock the drill on and hit breakers until the scream stops   for running wires through existing walls you need fish tape often two tapes are needed though sometimes a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice  fish tapes can be rented  electrical tape  lots of it   seriously a good and competent wiring job will need very little tape  the tape is useful for wrapping dicy insulation in repair work  another use is to wrap  around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination screws  i dont do this but drywall contractors prefer it to prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that has no cover plate   the ul stands for underwriters laboratory  it used to be an insurance industry organization but now it is independent and nonprofit  it tests electrical components and equipment for potential hazards  when something is ullisted that means that the ul has tested the device and it meets their requirements for safety  ie fire or shock hazard  it doesnt necessarily mean that the device actually does what its supposed to just that it probably wont kill you  the ul does not have power of law in the us  you are permitted to buy and install nonullisted devices  however insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to the failure of a nonullisted device  furthermore in many situations the nec will require that a wiring component used for a specific purpose is ullisted for that purpose indirectly this means that certain parts of your wiring must be ullisted before an inspector will approve it andor occupancy permits issued   every electrical device or component must be certified by the canadian standards association before it can be sold in canada  implicit in this is that all wiring must be done with csaapproved materials  they perform testing similar to the ul a bit more stringent except that csa approval is required by law  again like the ul if a fire was caused by noncsaapproved equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the claim  in canada there is a branch organization of the ul called ulc ul of canada  ulc does not have power of law and seems to be more a liason group between the csa and insurance companies   usa the following three books were suggested by our readers      residential wiring     by jeff markell     craftsman books     carlsbad ca for 0000 isbn 0000000000      practical electrical wiring     residential farm and industrial  based on the national     electrical code    ansinfpa 00     herbert p richter and w creighton schwan     mcgrawhill book co      wiring simplified     h p richter and w c schwan     park publishing co  try to make sure that the book is based on the latest nec revision  which is currently 0000  canada ps knight authors and publishes a book called electrical code simplified  there appears to be a version published specific to each province and is very tied into the appropriate provincial code  it focuses on residential wiring and is indispensible for canadian diyers  it is better to get this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring or answer questions on the net   it is updated each time the provincial codes are  this book is available at all diy and hardware stores for less than c00   most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and inspections of any wiring that is done  amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reasons like insurance companies not liking to have to pay claims a permit and inspections provides some assurance that you your family your neighbors or subsequent owners of your home dont get killed or lose their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job  most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your home or order you to tear out any wiring done without a permit  california for instance is particularly nasty about this  if fire starts in your home and uninspected wiring is at fault insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage claims  in general the process goes like this  you apply to your local inspections office or building   department for a permit  you should have a sketch or   detailed drawing of what you plan on doing  this is   a good time to ask questions on any things youre not   sure of  if youre doing major work they may impose   special conditions on you require loading   calculations and ask other questions  at this point   they will tell you which inspections you will need  if youre installing a main panel you will need to   have the panel and service connections inspected   before your power utility will provide a connection   this is sometimes done by the local power authority   rather than the usual inspectors  after installing the boxes and wiring but before   the insulationwalls go up you will need a   roughin inspection  after the walls are up and the wiring is complete   you will need a final inspection  do i have to upgrade  in general there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings though there are some exceptions ie smoke detectors in some cases  however any new work must be done according to the latest electrical code  also if you do major work you may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all of your system  check with your local electrical inspector   one thing where things might get a bit confusing is the different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of a circuit  one person might talk about 000v another 000v or another 000v  these are all in fact exactly the same thing  in north america the utility companies are required to supply a splitphase 000 volt 0 feed to your house this works out as two 000v  0 legs  additionally since there are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring its not unreasonable to find 000v has dropped to 000v or 000v has dropped to 000v by the time the power reaches a wall outlet  especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run  for a number of reasons some historical some simple personal orneryness different people choose call them by slightly different numbers this faq has chosen to be consistent with calling them 000v and 000v except when actually saying what the measured voltage will be  confusing  a bit  just ignore it  one thing that might make this a little more understandable is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ie 000v instead of 000v value  what this implies is that the device is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that low  000v is not the same as 000v  000v is the voltage between phases of a 0phase y circuit that is 000v from neutral to any hot   000v is the voltage between phases of a 0phase y circuit thats 000v from hot to neutral  in keeping with 000v versus 000v strangeness motors intended to run on 000v three phase are often labelled as 000v   there are logically four wires involved with supplying the main panel with power  three of them will come from the utility pole and a fourth bare wire comes from elsewhere   the bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded  into the ground or to a wire buried in the foundation or sometimes  to the water supply pipe has to be metal continuous to where the main water pipe entering the house  watch out for galvanic action conductivity breaks often between copper and iron pipe this is the grounding conductor  it is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground  this wire normally carries no current  one of the other wires will be white or black with white or yellow stripes or sometimes simply black  it is the neutral wire it is connected to the centre tap cec center tap in the nec of the distribution transformer supplying the power  it is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place often inside the panel  the neutral and ground should not be connected anywhere else  otherwise weird andor dangerous things may happen  furthermore there should only be one grounding system in a home  some codes require more than one grounding electrode these will be connected together or connected to the neutral at a common point  still one grounding system  adding additional grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house wiring is unsafe and contrary to code  if you add a subpanel the ground and neutral are usually brought as separate conductors from the main panel and are not connected together in the subpanel ie still only one neutralground connection  however in some situations  certain categories of separate buildings you actually do have to provide a second grounding electrode  consult your inspector  the other two wires will usually be black and are the hot wires  they are attached to the distribution transformer as well  the two black wires are 000 degrees out of phase with each other  this means if you connect something to both hot wires the voltage will be 000 volts  if you connect something to the white and either of the two blacks you will get 000v  some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them this is either because the neutral and ground are connected together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one wire is doing dualduty as both neutral and ground or in some rare occasions the service has only one hot wire 000v only service   inside the panel connections are made to the incoming wires these connections are then used to supply power to selected portions of the home  there are three different combinations 0 one hot one neutral and ground 000v circuit 0 two hots no neutral and ground 000v circuit 0 two hots neutral and ground 000v circuit  neutral    andor two 000v circuits with a common neutral  0 is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and lighting within your house  0 is usually used for supplying power to major appliances such as stoves and dryers  they often have need for both 000v and 000v or for bringing several circuits from the panel box to a distribution point  0 is usually for special 000v motor circuits electric heaters or air conditioners  note in the us the nec frequently permits a circuit similar to 0 be used for stoves and dryers  namely that there are two hot wires and a wire that does dual duty as neutral and ground and is connected to the frame as well as providing the neutral for 000v purposes  three prong plugs instead of four only for stovesdryers connected to the main panel when connected to most subpanels 0 prong plugs and receptacles are required  in our notsohumble opinion this is crazy but the nfpa claims that this practice was reevaluated for the 0000 nec and found to be safe  check your local codes or inquire as to local practice  there are restrictions on when this is permissible  0 is usually wired with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for grounding  0 and 0 have one hot wire coloured red the other black a bare wire for grounding and in 0 a white wire for neutral  you will sometimes see 0 wired with just a black white and ground wire  since the white is hot in this case both the nec and cec requires that the white wire be permanently marked at the ends to indicate that it is a live wire  usually done with paint nail polish or sometimes electrical tape  each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse  there are in a few locales circuits that look like 0 0 or 0 except that they have two bare ground wires  some places require this for hot tubs and the like one ground is frame ground the other attaches to the motor  this may or may not be an alternative to gfci protection   according to the terminology in the cec and nec the grounding conductor is for the safety ground ie the green or bare wire  the word neutral is reserved for the white when you have a circuit with more than one hot wire  since the white wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the panel the proper term is grounded conductor  however the potential confusion between grounded conductor and grounding conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistakes  you should never use the bare wire as a grounded conductor or white wire as the grounding conductor even though they are connected together in the panel  but not in subpanels  subpanels are fed neutral and ground separately from the main panel  usually  in the trade and in common usage the word neutral is used for grounded conductor  this faq uses neutral simply to avoid potential confusion  we recommend that you use neutral too  thus the white wire is always except in some light switch applications neutral  not ground   fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels  for example if your toaster shorts out a fuse or breaker should trip protecting the wiring in the walls from melting  as such fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the wiring  ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself wont cause a fire  fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt safely when the current exceeds the rated value thereby interrupting the power to the circuit  fuses trip relatively fast  which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have large startup current surges  for motor circuits you can use a timedelay fuse one brand is fusetron which will avoid tripping on momentary overloads  a fusetron looks like a springloaded fuse  a fuse can only trip once then it must be replaced  breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices  they usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched into position against another contact  when the current flow through the device exceeds the rated value a bimetallic strip heats up and bends  by bending it trips the latch and the spring pulls the contacts apart  circuit breakers behave similarly to fusetrons  that is they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses  with high overloads they trip quickly  breakers can be reset a finite number of times  each time they trip or are thrown when the circuit is in use some arcing takes place which damages the contacts  thus breakers should not be used in place of switches unless they are specially listed for the purpose  neither fuses nor breakers limit the current per se  a dead short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time which can often cause severe damage   statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher risk of causing a fire than breaker panels  this is usually due to the fuse being loosely screwed in or the contacts corroding and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse being installed or the proverbial replace the fuse with a penny trick  since breakers are more permanently installed and have better connection mechanisms the risk of fire is considerably less  fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload  when a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting path  result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel melted service wiring through fires in the electrical distribution transformer and having your house burn down breakers dont do this  many jurisdictions particularly in canada no longer permit fuse panels in new installations  the nec does permit new fuse panels in some rare circumstances requiring the special inserts to key the fuseholder to specific size fuses  some devices notably certain large air conditioners require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel  the fuse is there to protect the motor windings from overload  check the labeling on the unit  this is usually only on large permanently installed motors  the installation instructions will tell you if you need one   for a 00 amp circuit use 00 gauge wire  for a 00 amp circuit you can use 00 gauge wire in most locales  for a long run though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid voltage drops  00 gauge is only slightly more expensive than 00 gauge though its stiffer and harder to work with  heres a quick table for normal situations  go up a size for more than 000 foot runs when the cable is in conduit or ganged with other wires in a place where they cant dissipate heat easily  gaugeamps 0000 0000 0000 000 000  we dont list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent on the application and precise wire type   there are two considerations voltage drop and heat buildup the smaller the wire is the higher the resistance is  when the resistance is higher the wire heats up more and there is more voltage drop in the wiring  the former is why you need highertemperature insulation andor bigger wires for use in conduit the latter is why you should use larger wire for long runs  neither effect is very significant over very short distances there are some very specific exceptions where use of smaller wire is allowed  the obvious one is the line cord on most lamps  dont try this unless youre certain that your use fits one of those exceptions you can never go wrong by using larger wire   this is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors in a cable  the first number specifies the gauge  the second the number of current carrying conductors in the wire  but remember theres usually an extra ground wire  000 means 00 gauge two insulated current carrying wires plus bare ground  0 wire usually has a black white and bare ground wire  sometimes the white is red instead for 000v circuits without neutral  in the latter case the sheath is usually red too  0 wire usually has a black red white and bare ground wire usually carrying 000v with neutral  used  a wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy thats used to connect wires together  marrette or marr connector are trade names  youll usually use a lot of them in diy wiring  in essence you strip the end of the wires about an inch twist them together then twist the wirenut on  though some wirenuts advertise that you dont need to twist the wire do it anyways  its more mechanically and electrically secure  there are many different sizes of wire nut  you should check that the wire nut youre using is the correct size for the quantity and sizes of wire youre connecting together  dont just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or your fingers  use a pair of blunt nose linesman pliers and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly  sometimes its a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it goes in the wirenut properly  some people wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical tape  this is probably not a good idea  the inspector may tear it off during an inspection  its usually done because a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut  instead of taping it the connection should be redone   a gfci is a groundfault circuit interrupter  it measures the current current flowing through the hot wire and the neutral wire  if they differ by more than a few milliamps the presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other path  this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance or to the ground lead or through a person  any of these situations is hazardous so the gfci trips breaking the circuit  gfcis do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks  if for example you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral leads of a circuit and no part of you was grounded a gfci wouldnt help  all of the current that passed from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead keeping the gfci happy  the two pairs of connections on a gfci outlet are not symmetric one is labeled load the other line  the incoming power feed must be connected to the line side or the outlet will not be protected  the load side can be used to protect all devices downstream from it  thus a whole string of outlets can be covered by a single gfci outlet   the nec mandates gfcis for 000v 00a or 00a single phase outlets in bathrooms kitchens within 0 of the sink garages unfinished basements or crawl spaces outdoors near a pool or just about anywhere else where youre likely to encounter water or dampness  there are exceptions for inaccessible outlets those dedicated to appliances occupying fixed space typically refrigerators and freezers and for sump pumps and laundry appliances  the cec does not mandate as many gfcis  in particular there is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets or most garage or basement outlets  basement outlets must be protected if you have a dirt floor garage outlets if theyre near the door to outside  bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have gfcis  even if you are not required to have gfci protection you may want to consider installing it anyway  unless you need a gfci breaker see below the cost is low  in the us gfci outlets can cost as little as us0  costs are a bit higher in canada  c00  evaluate your own risk factors  does your finished basement ever get wet  do you have small children do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools  does water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage   gfcis are generally not used on circuits that a dont pose a safety risk and b are used to power equipment that must run unattended for long periods of time  refrigerators freezers and sump pumps are good examples  the rationale is that gfcis are sometimes prone to nuisance trips  some people claim that the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary current imbalance tripping the gfci  note though that most gfci trips are real if youre getting a lot of trips for no apparent reason youd be welladvised to check your wiring before deciding that the gfci is broken or useless   for most situations you can use either a gfci outlet as the first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with a builtin gfci  the former is generally preferred since gfci breakers are quite expensive  for example an ordinary ge breaker costs us0 the gfci model costs us00  there is one major exception  if you need to protect a multiwire branch circuit two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire such as a canadianstyle kitchen circuit youll need a multipole gfci breaker  unfortunately these are expensive the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars depending on what brand of panel box you have  but if you must protect such a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice  one more caveat  gfci outlets are bulky  you may want to use an oversize box when installing them  on second thought use large actually deep boxes everywhere  youll thank yourself for it  incidentally if youre installing a gfci to ensure that one specific outlet is protected such as a bathroom you dont really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom and not gfci anything upstream of it  but protecting the whole circuit is preferred  when you install a gfci its a good idea to use the little ground fault protected stickers that come with it and mark the outlets downstream of the gfci  you can figure out which outlets are downstream simply by tripping the gfci with the test button and see which outlets are dead   apart from their use in electronics which we wont comment on and for certain fluorescent lights they wont turn on without a good ground connection theyre intended to guard against insulation failures within the device  generally the case of the appliance is connected to the ground lead  if theres an insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case the ground lead conducts the electricity away safely and possibly trips the circuit breaker in the process  if the case is not grounded and such a short occurs the case is live  and if you touch it while youre grounded youll get zapped  of course if the circuit is gfciprotected it will be a very tiny zap  which is why you can use gfcis to replace ungrounded outlets both nec and cec  there are some appliances that should never be grounded  in particular that applies to toasters and anything else with exposed conductors  consider  if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster and youre not grounded nothing will happen  if youre slightly grounded youll get a small shock the resistance will be too high  but if the case were grounded and you were holding it youd be the perfect path to ground   nowadays many twoprong devices have one prong wider than the other  this is so that the device could rely not guaranteed on one specific wire being neutral and the other hot this is particularly advantageous in light fixtures where the the shell should neutral safety or other devices which want to have an approximate ground reference ie some radios  most 0prong extension cords have wide prongs too  this requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right way around  you want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow one hot  most outlets have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter coloured screw for the neutral if not you can usually figure out which is which by which prong the terminating screw connects to   the nec requires at least two 00 amp small appliance circuits for kitchens  the cec requires splitduplex receptacles  outlets must be installed such that no point is more than 00 nec 000 mm cec from an outlet  every counter wider than 00 nec or 000 mm cec must have at least one outlet the circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except in the kitchen pantry or dining room  furthermore these circuits are in addition to any required for refrigerators stoves microwaves lighting etc  nondedicated outlets within 0 of a sink must be protected by a gfci nec only  split duplex receptacles are fed with a 000v circuit  the tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot goes to the upper outlet and the other hot goes to the lower outlet the neutral connects to both outlets through one screw  when carrying through to another outlet the neutral must be pigtailed such that removing the outlet or having the neutral connection fall off doesnt cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlets   there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in the light fixture  all such outlets must be gfciprotected   romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire sometimes called nonmetallic sheath  the formal name is nm this is suitable for use in dry protected areas ie inside stud walls on the sides of joists etc that are not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat  most newer homes are wired almost exclusively with nm wire  there are several different categories of nm cable  bx cable  technically known as armored cable or ac has a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is fairly resistant to damage  teck cable is ac with an additional external thermoplastic sheath  protection for cable in concealed locations where nm or ac cable is run through studs joists or similar wooden members the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least 00mm000 cec  nec from the edges of the wooden members or the cable should be protected from mechanical injury  this latter protection can take the form of metal plates such as spare outlet box ends or conduit  note inspectorpermitted practise in canada suggests that armored cable or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection but this is technically illegal  additional protection recommendations these are rules in the canadian codes  they are reasonable answers to the vague references to exposed to mechanical damage in both the nec and cec       nm cable should be protected against mechanical damage       where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls       in exposed locations under 0 feet from the floor       ie use ac instead flexible conduit wooden guards etc      where cable is suspended as in connections to furnaces       or water heaters the wire should be protected  canadian       practise is usually to install a junction or outlet       box on the wall and use a short length of ac cable       or nm cable in flexible conduit to jump to the appliance       stapling nm to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used      where nm cable is run in close proximity to heating       ducts or pipe heat transfer should be minimized by       means of a 00mm0 air space or suitable insulation       material a wad of fiberglass      nm cable shall be supported within 000mm0 of every box       or fitting and at intervals of no more than 00m0       holes in joists or studs are considered supports       some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to       each box  while fishing cable is technically in violation       it is permitted where proper support is impractical      0 conductor nm cable should never be stapled on edge       knight also insists on only one cable per staple referring       to the workmanship clause but this seems more honoured       in the breach      cable should never be buried in plaster cement or       similar finish      cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards      cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists       or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more       than 0m 00  whenever bx cable is terminated at a box with a clamp small plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through the insulation  bx is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by solid wall coverings  in places where damage is more likely like on the back wall of a garage  you may be required to use conduit a ul or csa approved metal pipe  you use various types of fittings to join the pipe or provide entranceexit for the wire  service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit  in damp places eg buried wiring to outdoor lighting you will need special wire eg cec nmw00 nec uf  nmw00 looks like very heavyduty nmd00  you will usually need short lengths of conduit where the wire entersexits the ground  see underground wiring section   thermoplastic sheath wire such as nm nmw etc should not be  exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that  purpose  many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through furnace ducts including cold air return plenums constructed by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces   the reason for this is that if theres a fire the ducting will spread toxic gasses from burning insulation very rapidly through the building teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas   canada appears to use similar wire designations to the us  except that canadian wire designations usually include the  temperature rating in celsius  eg ac00 versus ac in the us nmb is 00 degrees celcius  note local codes vary  this is one of the items that changes most often  eg chicago codes require conduit everywhere there are very different requirements for mobile homes check your local codes especially if youre doing anything thats the slightest out of the ordinary  wire selection table incomplete  the real tables are enormous uncommon wire types or applications omitted

nonmetallic cable only  the reasoning is simple  with armored cable the box itself provides ground conductor continuity  us plastic boxes dont use metal cable clamps  the cec is slightly different  the cec never permits cable armor as a grounding conductor  however you must still provide ground continuity for metallic sheath  the cec also requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes  the advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for nonmetallic sheathed cable  you can avoid making one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little less  on the other hand plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts  for exposed or shop wiring metal boxes are probably better   a junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together  junction boxes must be located in such a way that theyre accessible later  ie not buried under plaster  excessive use of junction boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation and inspectors may get nasty   in general one can replace fixtures freely subject to a few caveats  first of course one should check the amperage rating of the circuit  if your heart is set on installing half a dozen 000 watt floodlights you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box  but there are some more subtle constraints as well  for example older house wiring doesnt have hightemperature insulation  the excess heat generated by a ceilingmounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad results some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high temperature wire only  you may find in fact that your ceiling wiring already has this problem in which case replacing any devices is a real adventure  other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixtures and making sure that the ceiling box and its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan  you may need to install a new box specifically listed for this purpose  a 0x0 across the ceiling joists makes a good support  metal brackets are also available that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and mounted between the joists  there are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as pot lamps or heat lamps  when these are installed in insulated ceilings they can present a very substantial fire hazard the cec provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated ceilings provided that the fixture is boxed in a coffin usually 0x00x00  made by making a pair of joists 00 high and covering with plywood that doesnt have any insulation  yes thats 0 feet long  nec rules are somewhat less stringent  they require at least 0 clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation the rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement which means that a cecstyle coffin might be worthwhile presumably thats up to the local inspector  the cec doesnt actually mandate the coffin perse this seems to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture cant get accidentally buried in insulation  ie if you have insulation blown in later  there are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation  they are usually limited to 00 watt bulbs and are unfortunately somewhat more expensive than the older types  before you use them you should ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such uses follow the installation instructions carefully the prescribed location for the sensor can vary  there does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved for use in insulation  the coffin appears the only legal approach   this usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is loose  depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up being more than 000v and the other less than 000v with respect to ground  this is a very hazardous situation  it can destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fires and in some situations electrocute you ie some us jurisdictions require the stove frame connected to neutral  if this happens contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem  note a brief  0 second brightening is sometimes normal with lighting and motors on the same 000v with neutral circuit  a loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness far longer than one second  in case of doubt get help   three phase power has three hot wires 000 degrees out of phase with each other  these are usually used for large motors because it is more efficient provides a bit more starting torque and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper  youre most likely to encounter a 0 phase circuit that shows 000 volts between any hot and ground and 000 volts between any two hots  the latter shows the difference between a normal 000v000v common neutral circuit which is 000 volts between the two hots  there are 0 phase circuits with different voltages  bringing in a 0 phase feed to your house is usually ridiculously expensive or impossible  if the equipment you want to run has a standard motor mount it is much cheaper to buy a new 000v or 000v motor for it  in some cases it is possible to run 0 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor as a autogenerator  these are tricky but are a good solution if the motor is nonstandard size or too expensive or too big to replace  the taunton press book the small shop has an article on how to do this if you must  note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using such a converter  the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that   theoretically it doesnt make any difference  however there is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply wiring  all things being equal a 000v motor will lose 0 times less power in the house wiring than a 000v motor  this also means that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor will get to speed quicker  and in some circumstances the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life  this is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more than 00 feet long   it is a universal physical law that 0 hp is equal to 000 watts  given heating loss power factor and other inefficiencies it is usually best to consider 0 hp is going to need 00000000 watts  a 000v 00a circuit can only deliver 0000 watts to a motor so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 0 hp  given rational efficiency factors 00hp is more like it  some equipment manufacturers sears in particular most router manufacturers in general  advertise a hp rating that is far in excess of what is possible  they are giving you a stall horsepower or similar  that means the power is measured when the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load what they dont mention is that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker will trip otherwise the motor will melt  its drawing far more current than it can continuously  when comparing motors compare the continuous horsepower  this should be on the motor nameplate  if you cant find that figure check the amperage rating which is always present   older homes frequently have twoprong receptacles instead of the more modern three  these receptacles have no safety ground and the cabling usually has no ground wire  neither the nec or cec permits installing new 0 prong receptacles anymore  there are several different approaches to solving this     0 if the wiring is done through conduit or bx and the        conduit is continuous back to the panel you can connect        the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle        box  nec mainly  cec frowns on this practise     0 if there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby and        its continuous to the main house ground point you can        run a conductor to it from the third prong     0 run a ground conductor back to the main panel     0 easiest install a gfci receptacle  the ground lug        should not be connected to anything but the gfci        protection itself will serve instead  the gfci        will also protect downstream possibly also two prong        outlets  if you do this to protect downstream outlets        the grounds must not be connected together  since it        wouldnt be connected to a real ground a wiring fault        could energize the cases of 0 prong devices connected        to other outlets  be sure though that there arent        indirect ground plug connections such as via the sheath        on bx cable  the cec permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the u ground with a nonconducting goop like caulking compound  this is not permitted in the nec  should the test button work  were sure about what the nec and cec say  remember though that your local codes may vary  as for the test button  theres a resistor connecting the load side of the hot wire to the line side of the neutral wire when you press the test button  current through this resistor shows up as an imbalance and trips the gfci this is a simple passive and reliable test and doesnt require a real ground to work  if your gfci does not trip when you press the test button it is very probably defective or miswired  again if the test button doesnt work somethings broken and potentially dangerous  the problem should be corrected immediately  the instructions that come with some gfcis specify that the ground wire must be connected  we do not know why they say this  the causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet or with the formalities of ul or csa listing  perhaps the device was never tested without the ground wire being connected  on the other hand ul or csa approval should only have been granted if the device behaves properly in all listed applications including ungrounded outlet replacement  one of us called leviton their gfcis are labeled for installation on grounded circuits only  the technician was surprised to see that he agreed that the nec does not require it and promised to investigate   as with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all devices that will be on simultaneously  the code specifies that you should stay under 00 of the nominal capacity of the circuit  for typical home shop use this means one circuit for the major power tools and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac  use at least 00 gauge wire  many power tools have big motors with a big startup surge  if you can use 00 amp breakers nec though cec requires standard 00a receptacles which means youd have to replug all your equipment  lights should either be on a circuit of their own  and not shared with circuits in the rest of the house  or be on at least two separate circuits  the idea is that you want to avoid a situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand rpm while youre groping in the dark for the off switch  do install lots of outlets  its easier to install them in the beginning when you dont have to cut into an existing cable its useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you really want  but use metal boxes and plates and maybe even metalsheathed cable you may have objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit wrong  note that some jurisdictions have a no horizontal wiring rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used for working  what this means is that all wiring must be run along structural members  ie stapled to studs  other possible shop circuits include heater circuits 000v circuits for some large tools and air compressor circuits dont overload circuits and dont use extension cords if you can help it unless theyre rated for high currents  a coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gauge  also the insulation wont withstand as much heat and heat dissipation is the critical issue  if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop wiring from it  if you have young children you may want to equip this panel with a cutoff switch and possibly a lock if you want to install individual switches to safe particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high enough for example ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the startup surge generated by a table saw  buy horsepowerrated switches instead  finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply  and even if you know that youd never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might have a different idea  note fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop wiring  april 0000 is one place to start   you will need to prepare a trench to specifications use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber dont use creosoted lumber it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead  the transition from inhouse to underground wire is generally via conduit  all outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets fittings etc  if the location of the box is subject to immersion in water a more serious style of waterproof box is needed  and of course dont forget the gfcis  the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation  a hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed   during the 0000s aluminum instead of copper wiring became quite popular and was extensively used  since that time aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations we recommend even if youre allowed to that do not use it for new wiring  but dont panic if your house has aluminum wiring  aluminum wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as copper aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper installation  we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems and what you can do to make your wiring safe  the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as cold creep  when aluminum wiring warms up it expands  when it cools down it contracts  unlike copper when aluminum goes through a number of warmcool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each time  to make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance of the connection goes up  which causes it to heat up and corrode oxidize still more  eventually the wire may start getting very hot melt the insulation or fixture its attached to and possibly even cause a fire  since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the 00s we will cover basic points of safe aluminum wiring  we suggest that if youre considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things      0 fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to        aluminum wiring should be rated for it  the device will        be stamped with alcu or coalr  the latter supersedes        the former but both are safe   these fixtures are somewhat        more expensive than the ordinary ones      0 wires should be properly connected at least 00 way around        the screw in a clockwise direction  connections should be        tight  while repeated tightening of the screws can make the        problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug        up each connection         note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the        main service entrance cable  it should be inspected      0 pushin terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire        any connections using pushin terminals should be redone with        the proper screw connections immediately      0 there should be no signs of overheating darkened connections        melted insulation or baked fixtures  any such damage should        be repaired          0 connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be        handled specially  current canadian codes require that the        wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting        aluminum to copper  the nec requires that the wire be        connected together using special crimp devices with an        antioxidant grease  the tools and materials for the latter        are quite expensive  not practical to do it yourself unless        you can rent the tool      0 any nonrated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring        by means of a short copper pigtail  see 0 above          0 shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped        not nicked wire etc      if when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wiring safe  if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere  if the wrong receptacles are used you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails  having this professionally done can range from 0 to 00 per receptacleswitch you can do this yourself too   congratulations  but  its generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as well  if an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any minor problems are fixed  if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere  heres some hints on what to look for  obvious noncode wiring can include   zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls  hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without   proper marking  ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of   a gfci  splices hanging in midair other than proper knobandtube  switched neutrals  unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines  certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one time sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations   switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps    not properly terminated wiring  a wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are   separately controlled by other wall switches  except when   its really convenient   switches and outlets in bizarre locations  great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps  junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them  wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or   ceiling  backwrapped grounding wires   in the years since edison invented electricity several different wiring styles have come and gone  when you buy an older home you may encounter some of this stuff  this section describes the old  methods and some of their idiosyncrasies  the oldest wiring system youre likely to encounter is called knob and tube kt  it is made up of individual conductors with a cloth insulation  the wires are run along side structural members eg joists or studs using ceramic standoffs knobs wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes  connections were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping with tape  since the hot and neutral were run separately the wiring tends to be rather confusing  a neutral often runs down the centre of each room with taps off to each fixture the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next  in some cases kt isnt colourcoded so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wires  youll see kt in homes built as late as the 00s  comments on kt   the people installing kt were pretty paranoid about   electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good  the wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up   very well  most kt ive seen for example is in   quite good condition  no grounding  grounding is usually difficult to install  boxes are small  receptacle replacement particularly with   gfci can be difficult  no bushing on boxes either   so wiring changes need special attention to box entry  sometimes the neutral isnt balanced very well between   separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to   overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on   any circuit  building code does not permit insulation in walls   that contain kt  connection to existing kt from new circuits can be   tricky  consult your inspector  modern wiring practise requires considerably more   outlets to be installed than kt systems did  since kt tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isnt necessary to replace it simply because its kt  what you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit loading  in many cases its perfectly reasonable to leave existing kt alone and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern techniques  after kt they invented multiconductor cable  the first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation  it looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or two  this stuff was used in the 00s and 00s  again no grounding conductor it was installed much like modern wiring  its major drawback is that this type of insulation embrittles  weve seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch  bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems  this stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become bare  this wiring should be left untouched as much as possible  whenever an opportunity arises replace it a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heatshrink tubing  after this wiring technique the more modern romex was invented its almost a asphalt impregnated cloth  often a bit sticky this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesnt present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work with  it does not need to be replaced  it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff  thermoplastic insulation wire  just dont abuse it too much   try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you  their prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or diy centres have better quality materials have wider variety including the odd stuff and have people behind the counter that know what youre talking about  cultivate friendly knowledgeable sales people  theyll give you much valuable information   chris lewis clewisferretocunixonca phone canada 000 0000000 psroff 00 info psroffrequestferretocunixonca ferret list ferretrequestferretocunixonca

   i want to upgrade my system and was thinking of buying adcom seperates  i have heard from alot of people though that adcom sounds great but  that the components are made cheaply and therefore wont last very long  the time estimates ive heard are like only 0 or 0 years  is this true  i own the adcom 00w power amp  as far as im concerned theres no   amp which can touch it at the price range the build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other    amps in the price range  the whole amplifier is extremely solid   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing if you open the amp up there are only very good quality components    in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well  perfect   symmetry for both channels and two transformers  one for each   channel  the binding posts on the back of the amplifier are   virtually the same as those on the classe model 00 ie very good  i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast   or whereever  but if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant i cannot see why people say the amplifier wont last  not with   those quality components inside  sure the amp runs very fairly   hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good  my last point i recently auditioned the adcom preamp something like   the 000 or something  it was two years old and it still sounded   like new  if you build an amplifier decently like the adcoms they will   sound brilliant and last a long time  period  just my thoughts but then  i do own one of adcoms amps        alan webber                                                                           webbitu0sunacza                                                 webbitu0sunacza                                                                                                the path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high    the ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by            apprehension creeping like a chootrain up your spine               will the tightrope reach the end will the final couplet rhyme

  hi i am looking for some help in choosing a package for a highspeed silicon adc 000mhz currently being  fabricated this is a phd research project and i have to test the chip at speed on a pcb i expect to have roughly 000 packaged circuits and will do dc lowspeed and highspeed testing using 0 different setups for the test chip   i know for sure that a dip will not work the long lead lines have too high an inductance getting a custommade package is too expensive so i am trying to choose between a flatpak and a leadless chip carrier the flatpack would be hard to test since it has to be soldered on to the test setup and i would spend loads of time soldering  as i kept changing the test chip the leadless chip carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may not work at high speeds   does anyone out there have experienceknowledge of this field  i would greatly appreciate help any ideas names of companies manufacturing holderssocketspackages would help    ps the multilayer fancy gaas packages seem like a bit of overkill    seema varma

  so  heres my question  it seems to me that id have the same electrical circuit if i hooked the neutral jumper from the neutral over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets whats wrong with my reasoning here  first go to the local hardware store and pick up a copy of wiring simplified by hl richter  now if your house is wired with metal conduit you dont need a seperate ground wire assuming the house is wired correctly and the pipes are connected to a cold water pipe in your basement  the outlets that have a neutral hooked to the ground screw seem wrong  anyone else think so  back in the 00s i was a service technician for a cash register company the cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were very susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise  the biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded  in almost every place we went to do an installation we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral  for 000 of the things you can plug into one of these they work fine  for our cash registers they were a nightmare  line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically  with modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem  even the company i used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment  i imagine if you check most household wiring you will find that the ground and neutral are connected  although not ideal it should be ok for most applications     slmr 00  my reality check just bounced                                   the ozone hole bbs  a private bulletin board service  0000000000 0 full service nodes  usrobotics 000k bps  00 gigs  000000 files skydive new orleans  rime network mail hub  000 usenet newsgroups please route all questions or inquiries to  postmasterozoneholecom

  one thing to consider is time division multiplexing the emg channels to reduce the number of rf carriers you have to generate if you multiplexed the emg inputs at 00khz that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies youd have  000 hz per channel sampling rate  that level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish  combining a lot of rf carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation  a system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced  a commercial handheld transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth obviously this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws govern the use of transeivers in your location     bill mayhew      neoucom computer services department rootstown oh  000000000  usa    phone 0000000000 wtmuhuraneoucomedu 00000000    000000 n0wed

   what you can do if you want threeprong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a gfci outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper  in fact depending on where you are putting your new outlets a gfci may be required  you still need to supply a proper ground for a ground fault circuit interrupter  oddly enough you dont at least according to the wiring faq that is regularly posted on miscconsumershouse  a gfci senses discrepancies between the live and neutral wire currents and cuts them both off if a discrepancy is found  no ground connection is needed for it to function        michael a covington associate research scientist               artificial intelligence programs      mcovingtaiugaedu      the university of georgia              phone 000 0000000           athens georgia 000000000 usa     amateur radio n0tmi

  acollinsuclinkberkeleyedu andy collins writes  how thick do i need to make a pcb trace for 00 amps of current and does anybody have any other thoughts on the process what kind of pcb to use materials thickness of copper any advice graciously accepted  in four replies ive seen no hard numbers so here goes  for traces on the outside not inner layers expect in 0 oz copper at 00 amps the following temperature rises versus width  this is from sams reference data for engineers seventh edition pg 000 which claims in turn to be from milstd000c      width   temp rise     inches  degrees c             000000      00 00      00 00      00 00      00 00      00 00  at 00 amps the rise for the 000 width is only about 00 degrees power goes as square of the current plus the copper resistance goes up as temperature goes up  certainly 00 0mm traces should be  ample for what you want to do  and 0 ounce copper almost cuts the  required width in half  id do 0 oz at about 000 width myself  i thinkgiven that the rated current is 00 amps and the 00 is a transient or fault condition  theres another question will the voltage drop be low enough but you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or just the resistivity of copper  keep traces short and use separate sensing traces where appropriate as mentioned by another poster

  crispecsvaxuncecsedu russ crisp writes  so  heres my question  it seems to me that id have the same electrical circuit if i hooked a jumper from the neutral over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets whats wrong with my reasoning here    may i respectfully suggest you not do this  the ground is supposed to be a protective ground and though what you suggest looks good on paper its dangerous to rely on the same wire for power and protection  itd never meet code and if you now own the property and later sell it you may end up with liabilities you dont want and if you dont now own it well  theres a wiring faq that i think addresses this  i believe an alternative is use of a gfci but im really not sure what current code allows in this area  the gfci senses alternate unwanted current paths and doesnt rely on a specific protective ground wire at least not beyond the gfci in the protected circuit  gfci breakers are available but expensive

   stuff deleted  i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast   or whereever  but if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant  good pointalso i wouldnt be surprised that the components they use offshore are of inferior quality  as long as it was properly designed and robust premium components are used it shouldnt matter where it is assembled  i cannot see why people say the amplifier wont last  not with   those quality components inside  sure the amp runs very fairly   hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good  an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how its gonna sound the amp you have probably is running classa the whole day  actually id be wary of excessively hot amps cauz even though the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive  heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component regardless of quality  in fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  hmmmmm  aaron

  there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here  a few points need to be clarified  the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects  it should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load  some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor    much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  orange outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service  anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems  the code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance  where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod  many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either   the grounded conductor of a circuit often called the neutral which is referred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey  this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel  this connection is through the main bonding jumper  in many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel    the grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor  in the case of a 000 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device    since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions  if you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor  since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end  if the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the u ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential  the difference under normal non shortcircuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two  this normally does not present a shock hazard    however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path  if the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire  it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat  with the incorrect non singlepoint grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire    also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction  i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment  the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling  this is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly  the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer  some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground  there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy  dont flame me on this im just telling you where the field comes from not its health effect as far as im concerned the jury is still out on this  note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at any sub distribution panels  this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral  the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor  if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above  the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another  in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire  every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review  these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before u ground outlets and such  the appliance manufacturers dont want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors dont want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances  no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the 000 volt hots except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage  so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings its primarily for lightning protection  people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isnt a legal grounding conductor  obviously the bare wire in romex with ground is  anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor  the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath  you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you dont have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes    greenfield looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is not a legal grounding conductor as it doesnt have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance  you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield  wiremold is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box  i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with 000 volts why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box  you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever  on another issue while you should ground the green wirelug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available  it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you dont install it  the interrupter doesnt depend on the ground to trip  it is desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path  for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfis read in the nec 0000 d exception this is the 0000 code my 00 code is in the city but i know the rule hasnt changed  it might be renumbered though   we have only touched the surface concerning grounding   there is much more to this subject but most of you have fallen asleep by now    john    john h schmidt

  this is a followup post to something ive written previously  several people responded with good information but i dont think i communicated  exactly what i am looking for im working on a custom io device that will communicate with a host via rs000  my custom circuitry will use an 00c000eb or ec cpu and require about 00k of ram preferably flash ram  in looking around i see that lots of people have engineered uartcpuromram subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom io devices  its been done so much that it  would be best if i can avoid reinventing a system  it just needs to use an 00c000 or 000 cpu and be able to load a program from the host then  transfer control to that program  well theres one other thing the rom needs to know how to do  it should have routines to send and receive bytes tofrom the host that utilize the hardware control lines dtrrtsdtscts everything ive seen is in the 00000 and up range  thats too much for this application  i need something around 00000  the cpu has the uart builtin so youre only looking at a few chips  does anyone know a  company that markets a good board in this range or some public domain  circuitry i can use  thanks in advance for the info  rich

  rubincisohiostateedu daniel j rubin writes how hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular  motorola microcontrollers  not hard you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software but this hogs most of the available cpu cycles on a lowend controller ive seen some application note from philips that used one of their 0000 derivatives as a printer buffer with up to 0mb of dynamic ram that was accessed and refreshed with software bitbanging  another alternative would be to use one of those nice dram controller chips that create static ram appearance and all that but they may be too expensive to make it worthwhile  segmented memory helps structure software

  i am making a search for a cad program that does a decent job of making schematic drawings  the program needs to be in msdos windows if possible  what i want the cad program to do is to draw diagrams by dragging elements onto the screen and in this the elements needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ics case with pins it also needs to have provision for adding legends to the components as well as their values  in other words i want to produce quality drawings  printout would be to either 00 pin dotmatrix andor laser printer  if you know of such a cad program that is of reasonable cost please respond  fred w culpepper old dominion university retired fculpeppnorfolkvak00ededu

   so when you turn on the power this causes the bulb to work like a neon  heating up and shorting out thus providing a loop to power the heaters in  the main tube when the tube fires insufficient current runs through the  starter to keep the heat up and the bimetalic strip straightens out  oc  imprecise this description   0 ignores the role of the ballast  0 misrepresents the heating effects in the starter  the bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit because the neon discharge stops and much less heat is generated from the i0r loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge  the starter contacts open before the tube fires  actually the tube fires as a result of the backemf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starters contacts  a capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing  the neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself   mustafa kocaturk   mustafaseassmuedu  ee dept room 000a caruth bldg home 0000000000  office 0000000000  smu box 000000 dallas tx 00000

  naglenetcomcom john nagle writes  great explaination however you left off one detail why do you always see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants  at nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water  as i recall the water isnt as hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination  actually the reasons you dont see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 0 fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller than nuclear plants  000 mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built  the average nuclear plant is 0000 mwe  0 many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted why those old dirt burners cant harm anything let em go   0 powered draft cooling towers low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from offsite are quite popular with fossil plants  0 fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears         actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boilingwater reactor nuclear plants  theres a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 0000 vintage steam technology  so its more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible  hence big cooling towers           oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient  some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one canadian official asked about thermal  pollution deicing a river said up here we view heat as a resource    actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size  the issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from  condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine  the condenser pressure is normally waters vapor pressure at the condensing temperature  it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes  the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best    a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes  since the condenser is at a very low pressure the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity  if the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate  this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs    the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps  how much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell  typically hotwell temperatures run between 000 and 000  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped  when the river water temperature is high in the summer operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head  there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area  at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air  the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers  the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity  it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 00 degrees  a vast difference from the typical 0000 days 00 degrees 00 humidity we see routinely in the east it is not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure         everybody runs closedcycle boilers  the water used is  purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils  purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than  cooling it so the boiler water is recycled  true  actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water  by impure i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity andor a few ppm of dissolved oxygen  secondary water is now typically the most pure one

   i recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the pickup  the result was noisy and distinctly lofi but much louder than a conventional phonograph  it tended to wear the disks out pretty quickly though  this was the pathe you are thinking of although there were other imitators it didnt wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs but it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air there are a lot of them still operating and they are pretty ingenious  there was a pneumatic amplifier designed by alexander graham bell as well but i dont know if it was ever constructed scott  
   greetings                situation  i have a phone jack mounted on a wall  i dont                     know the number of the line  and i dont want                     to call up the operator to place a trace on it          question   is there a certain device out there that i can                     use to find out the number to the line   call a friend long distance collect  ask to speak with yourself  when the operator asks for you you wont be there so ask the operator to leave your number  shell read it out in the clear scott  
   hi  i was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology  paper and i read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the  tv screen at 0000ths of a second  is that possible  i thought the  maximum rate the tv was even capable of displaying images was 000th  of a second  or 000th of a second for an image composed of only odd  or even scan lines  you are correct the fastest complete image that could be presented on tv would be one field which is 000 of a second approximately  of course the phrase tv screen is often thrown around in reference to any crt display so perhaps this researcher wasnt using normal tv rates  might even be a vector strokewriter display in which case the lower limit on image time is anyones guess and is probably phosphorpersistence limited  actually a lot of this work used to be done with a crt that had a beamsplitter mounted in front and a tachistoscope driving it  the tachistoscope is really just a slide projector with a very fast shutter  low tech but it does the job scott

   i understand that the new gps boxes now have an option known as differential ready  apparently landbased beacons tranmit gps correction information to your gps  receiver with differential option installed  how does this system work  what frequency is used for the landbased beacons  thanks in advance  charlie thompson   heres a rough sketch of how the system works  a reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming gps signals  these errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion sa selective availability time dithering etc  the reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to back out the errors in its position since it knows where it is already  it then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers  if the receivers are nearby 000km and are using the same satellites as the reference unit the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit  thus the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit  the us coast guard is currently as far as i know installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential gps  these stations will use existing radio towers  i believe the frequency is to be approximately 000 khz  there are many other private corporations offering dgps signals on different frequencies  for example pinpoint 0000000000 offers correction signals and receiver units using an fm broadcast system which has stations all across the us  the correction codes are usually transmitted using the rtcm 000 format advertised accuracies espouse 0 to 0 meter errors    john p baker                    my opinions are my own  i dont know johns hopkins university         anyone else who wants them anyway applied physics laboratory laurel md  00000                bakerjp0aplcommjhuapledu

   i dont know why my fpu has an xc my original 00mhz fpu was label mc0000000 but it seems to work fine on my system ps or does it mean experimental chip instead of motorola chip   the rule for the designations is that if it says mc that means it works exactly the way the datasheetbook specifies  if it says xc that means there is at least one known bug  often these bugs are small and obscure you might never run into them in practice  at least motorola admits it unlike certain other companies   all work is one mans work              henry spencer  u of toronto zoology                      kipling             henryzootorontoedu  utzoohenry

  i have never worked with really small signals before and have a few  questions about low level noise  i have noticed that the waveform  synthesizer that i am using analogic 0000 has some relatively large common mode noise on it  i am using this synthesizer to null out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference 000uv several hundred  times  the 0000 has about 00 mvpp of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat  the noise is not quite in sync with  line frequency and on a spectrum analyzer the main component is about 00hz  how can i get rid of the noise  when i look at the spectrum using an hp 0000a audio range analyzer the noise goes away the minute i switch to  isolation on the input  i am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the  input since it will read accurately down to dc  also if i use a differential amplifier ia to solve the problem  how important is it to use one of these shield drivers an amp connected  to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused  by different cable capacitances  if anyone can suggest a good ic ia for  use with transient signals with content from 0khz to about 000khz i would appreciate it

       just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles on your electronic odometer with an oscillator      i wouldnt expect to be able to do this  not because the engineers at bmw are putting in antifraud logic but just because an automobile is a noisy hostile environment for electronics and i would expect the software to be conservative     if i were to design a microprocessorbased odometerspeedometer program it would have the following features  just off the top of my head             debouncingdeglitching   is this a real pulse or just a glitch            smoothing  the rateofchange of speed cannot be too high                                 this is a car not an electron            top speed limit  anything above 000mph is ridiculous must be                                         electrical noise or contact bounce      as for getting in and presetting the pins  if this is the circuit board out of a bmw dashboard i seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the middle of the card  good luck getting at the counter       i wouldnt expect a high input frequency to damage the meter  remember its probably damped so it cant move too fast and is probably protected  after all a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics  there used to be an app note in the national semiconductor linear databook that went into this in good detail                                  jerry kaidor  tr0jerrydragomancom jkaidorsynopticscom                                       jerry kaidor

  hi i was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related subjects i am currently learning about amfm receivers and recieving circuits i understand a lot of things but a few things i am confused abuot the first is the mixer to mix the rf and local oscillator frequencies to make the if does anyone have any cicruit diagrams as simple as possible for this kind of mixer i have come across a mcsbl mixer chip but i have not been able to find it in any catalogs activeetc   along the same note are there any simple fm receiver circuits anyone may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see  ps any really good books on amfm theory along with detailed electrical diagrams would help a lot i have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of circuit books with no theory but one without the other does not help  thanks  mark musone

  i built a little project using the radio shack 0vdc relays to switch audio  i got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched  i was doing most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks   my question is  is there a good relayrelay circuit that i can use for switching audio so that there will be no noise of any kind on the audio lines   i will appreciate any advice or references to advice  also exact part numberscompany names etc for the relays will help  are you switching high level signals or low level signals like preamp out level signals  also are the clicks you mentioning the big clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact bounce  how are you driving the relays  ttl gate output  switching transistor  how are the relays connected to what you are driving  need more specifics to answer your question

   i am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from a mc000000a real time clock  has anyone out there had some experience in doing this  the specs call for a few sequences to be met before standby mode is activated and are a bit hard to decipher on that but i thought that i had it worked out  however with a 00khz crystal the lowest current drain i can acheive at 00v vcc is 000ua  this is three times the specified maximum under the conditions i am attempting to create  i have done the following things  0 made sure that reset is asserted for trlh after powerup and as is    low during this time   0 made sure that there is a cycle on as after the negation of rd or    wr during which stby was asserted  what am i doing wrong  thanks very much  martin

   the fujitsu 0000 uses what is known as an smd interface storage module device  a lot of older minis used it  sun still does on their server models  there are several different speeds of smd and i think that the  fuji drive you have is rated at about 00 mbsec thats megabits  there used to be several companies that made couplers for the pc interphase in texas being one but i think that the market pretty much has dried up controllers for this type of drive are readily available for vme buses though  rumor has it that there is a smd to scsi adapter available but i think that it was designed for slower smd devices  in other words if you have a pc or mac that drive is pretty much dogmeat cheers corwin  
   currently i am using the 0000 microcontroller with external eprom  in order to drive the dc motor with direction i use the pulse width modultion   thru software controlassembly language programming however i am afraid that  they will be overheads and thus alter the pulse timing my question is   is the software pwm control reliable i understand that port 0 is a latch  and so i vary the duty cycle by setting it high first and at the desire   duty cycle then i set low any improments

   hi all  im an assistant manager at a local art theater here in columbus  id like to expand our show automation a bit namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up  our current automation consoles date from the early 00s and dont provide this function  we already have the combo failsafecontact rollers to read the cuetapes and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fadeup control circuit 000 vac is momentarily closed for at least 00 second  ive tried wiring the dimmer control to a 00v relay activated when the cue tape completes the circuit  low tech and simple but theres one problem  in order to get the 00 second pulse there needs to be a shload of cuetape on the film  00mm runs at 00 feet per minute so to get a 00 second pulse there needs to be at least 0 inches of solid cuetape  ideally i would like to use a single crosscue to accomplish this function a single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film this would give a pulse of approximately 0000 of a second what i need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 00 second  the ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice  i figure this would require an rc circuit of some sort  im sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads  any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated   thanks  mark fontana     of all the arts the cinema is    mark a fontana   the most important              computer and information science                     vi lenin    the ohio state university

   i had a similar idea for a faxanswering machine switch to put both machines on one line  you order distinctive ringing from your phone company  this is 0month here you get a second unpublished phone number  when someone calls this number your phone rings with short rings instead of long rings  you set up your answering machine on 0 rings and your fax on six rings  youd give out the new  as your fax  a device would measure the length of rings  when it detects a short ring it turns off your answering machine five rings later your fax picks up the call  this should be cheaper and more elegant than the 00 switches now available  but thats not what i did  im giving out the new  to my friends and customers  this should leave the old  for telemarketers etc  i wont pick up the phone when i hear the long rings   why my thoughts are my own when they are in but when they are out they are anothers  susannah martin hanged for witchcraft 0000 thomas david kehoe          kehoenetcomcom         000 0000000

  yes you increase the rpm slip of a boxer type fan by installing a capacitor in series with the fans power supply  the air flow of small 00 inch fans can be reduced by about 00 by using a 0 to 0 uf capacitor  use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 000 volts  note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application  for dc powered applications try the radio shack 00 volt box fan it can run and start reliably from as low as about 00 vdc  it is exceptionally quiet but at admittedly low flow  i wish i knew who made the fans for radio shack     bill mayhew      neoucom computer services department rootstown oh  000000000  usa    phone 0000000000 wtmuhuraneoucomedu 00000000    000000 n0wed

  it is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business  or for an illegal use  jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor   the results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed the federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not  a lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding  when you buy a radar detector amongst the guarrantees instructions  explanations and other detritus is an invitation to join an association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector i promise i am not making this up  i do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any  headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed  laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund raiser aspect of tickets    mike coyne

    i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video vs a blank screen by monitoring the rg and b outputs of a graphics card  it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 00 mhz which would mean detecting a 00 ns pulse  it should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen about 000 mv and a dim screen say around 000 mv  oh yes it also needs to be cheap    my first circuit was a dismal failure  i used 0 compariators each compariator had the  input going to one of the guns the  input went to a reference created by a voltage dividera potentiometer  the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow i needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators so i could have a whole screen full of text but my circuit would not detect it     the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen  in fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 000 mv  i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work    there are faster compariators but they are expensive and require  split supplies   i would need to replace my 00 quad compariator with three 000 compariators and create a whole new power supply circuit    at this point i think what i need is some sort of transistor circuit  transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick  unfortunately i am way out of my league when it comes to designing transistor circuits so i am appealing to the net for help  any ideas tips circuits pointers references etc would be greatly appreciated    oh yes i only sample the output of this thing every second or so so i dont need a fast response time at all however i havent found a way to take advantage of that fact  thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give of course you will have my undying gratitude   steve verity            steve verity                                  maxed on midi                                                    verityjacksnscom

      gstovallcrchh00nosubdomainnodomain greg stovall writes    anyway over the weekend i was resting on the sofa in between chores    and noticed that i briefly picked up what sounded like ham radio traffic    over my stereo and television even though both were off  also all the    touch sensitive lights in my house start going wacko cycling through     their four brightness states     i presume that some ham operator with an illegal amplifier drove past    my house i live on a busy thoroughfare would this be a correct presumption    what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects      the affected equipment is about 000 feet from the road  hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp  and are also unlikely to have a dirty amp     hams can legally run up to 0000 watts  it is very unlikely however    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  ham rigs  not possible either  youd need about a 000 amp alternator for just the amplifier  i can just see it  you need to slow down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button     for cars put out around 000 watts  it is possible that a 000 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 000 feet     away  most tvs stereos and vcrs have very poor rf shielding    if you experience the problem frequently it may be     caused by a ham cber or other radio operator in a base station    nearby    the interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes such as police fire    etc  if you heard voices over your stereo i think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter     if you have frequent trouble you may want to try the rf ferrite    chokes available at radio shack  the interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily without cutting them    good instructions are included with the chokes    if that does not solve the problem you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator  look for antennas on the roof    or car  talk to himher about your problem  there are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference  and please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator  this person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles  and youll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful most are  it was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as i grew up  we were blamed for skip ghost pictures on the tv that occur at sunspot peaks  cb interferance  dead grass   you name it    btw the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible  it is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the fcc views it too bad they dont require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions  last you can usually tell ham radio vs cb  ham operators are required to declare their call sign every so many minutes no more than 00  so if you hear this is wa0qt or some other call starting with a w or k and no more than 0 total characters you heard a ham cbers probably wont sign i dont know that theyre even required to and firepolice have other private ids        douglas s rand drandosforgosfmotif dev snail         00 cambridge center  cambridge  ma  00000 disclaimer    i dont know if osf agrees with me lets vote on it amateur radio kc0kj

    i was wondering what copy protection techniques are avaliable and how effective are they  has anyone have any experience in this area                        with highest regards                            babak   sehari  uh oh umm there are a number of copy protection schemes  some involve modifying the physical media and some involve encryption schemes c all of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have been successful for a time  i recall however near monthly releases of new ways to crack the copy protection scheme of the latest releases  the fact is none of them are completely secure or anywhere near it  some are more or less difficult to crack and some have already been cracked i guess what i am saying is that your question is difficult if not impossible to answer  what exactly do you want to know  do you need a good one for a project you are working on  how secure must it be  are you trying to crack one that someone else has used  i can probably make suggestions assuming the activity is strictly legal  in general it is a bad idea legally to tamper with copy protection  it can also lead to corruption of files which you necessarily do not have back ups of being as they are copy protected which can be devestating  do you have absolutely no ideas for practical applications and are merely curious please clear up those questions and ill try to help as much as i can  incidentally the uh oh at the top is indicative of the dread anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels when they are asked how to hack  the area you are broaching is wrought with dangers many of which include breaking the law or at least addressing it from one side or the other  matt

  one other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about nearuv light being cheaper to get at than actual uv light does anyone know what he was referring to  i dont want to get into a semantic argument but contrary to some other postings near uv light is actual uv light  the near means that it is close to the visible spectrum ie of relatively long wavelength not that it is nearly uv  im sure you can figure out now just what far uv is  regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of uv in the near end of the spectrum such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak uv source  stronger sources are going to require gas probably mercury vapor discharge tubes such as fluorescent tubes with uv phosphor  be careful though strong uv sources can cause physiological damage especially to the eyes  the shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous  it wouldnt project a beam like a flashlight but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source  it would be bright enough to be useful but not dangerously so  ed hall edhallrandorg

   could someone please tell me if a 00 decoder is the same as a 0 to 0  demultiplexer i know how to link 0 of these to get an 0 output circuit  but how do i link 0 of these to make a 000 multiplexer sorry if this  seems like a lame question but im only a newbie to electronics and i  have to do this circuit please make any mail as droolproof as possible     thanx  taro ogawa  u000000studentcanberraeduau  a 0 of 0 decoder need not be the same as a 0 to 0 demultiplexer although many commercial ssi implementations allow you to use one as such strictly a 0 of 0 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state according to the inputs  a demux on the other hand uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal so there are three inputs required  a decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable input since this can be used as the data input eg when high all outputs are high when low only the selected by control inputs output will be low  an eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit bit 0 to select which of two four way demuxes is enabled thus you achieve your aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits note that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux since you have no data input the enable line on a four way decoder left once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose  a sixteen way decoder obviously requires four fourway decoders plus a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time therefore use the fifth decoder attached to the two high order bits to provide the four enable lines  of course the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the four final stage decoders  please give me the credit when you submit your homework  johnh                                         electronics department                            school of mpce                macquarie university                                                   sydney australia 0000      email johnhmpcemqeduau ph 00 0 000 0000 fax 00 0 000 0000

  suppose we have a boolean function which is a minimal sumofproducts derived from a kmap or something like this  fabcd  bcd  acd  abc  abc  the books on logic design i have consulted all seem to imply that this is where the analysis ends    but by factoring out the a term in the function we can get fewer gates  fabcd  bcd  acd  bc  bc  which yields 0 gates   yes but the minimization of gates is important in part because of timing considerations  a ttl gate has the basic structure of andorinvert and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly one gate delay  the reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization  a positiveor gate such as the 0gate solution uses has two gate delays and theres another gate delay in the second term so that the second solution while simpler in logic symbols can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world ecl is similar to ttl in that it can support an orand gate with the minimum delay unlike ttl you get both true and inverse outputs for free when using ecl  pals are basically large programmable andorinvert gates with your choice of internal connections between the various sections and perhaps some latches so a minimum sum of products also is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few pals  its not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates but some software packages claim to allow you to do so and will take just about any mess of gates as a nodelist with 00xxx series logic ics and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job  xilinxs xact software does this by treating each logic block as a macro and expanding it all out then simplifying  john whitmore

  i am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and ive hit a snag in my application i want to be able to change the gain of an op amp amplifier from 0 to 0 controlable via a digital input the most obvious way ive come up with is to use analog switches to adjust the gain of the op amp the only analog switch i have experience with it the 0000 unfortunately i want to switch an ac signal which goes from about 0v to 0v and the 0000 is only for positive signals   i have a carrier signal which varies between 0v and 0v i want to demodulate an input signal by feeding the input signal thru a amp with a gain of 0 when the carrier is at 0v and thru a amp with a gain of 0 when the carrier is 0v the output is then low pass filtered i believe this is called lock in detection as well as synchronous demodulation  look at the 0000  this is a triple 0to0 transmissiongate analog multiplexer with positive and negative power supplies can be run from a singleended supply as well  with dual supplies the logic inputs still range from ground 0 volts to vdd  this is a neat well i think so design for a switchablepolarity amplifier                                                                                  input                                    opamp  output                                                        controlx analog switch                                                                      gnd  all resistors are equalvalue  when the analog switch is closed the amp is invertinggainofone  with the switch open it is noninvertinggainofone  you can clean up the circuit to trim out input offset current if this hurts the balance this would show up as carrier feedthrough  for high frequencies the slewrate of the opamp might cause problems especially if it isnt symmetrical and it usually isnt         paul elliott  dsc optilink  petaluma ca usa           uunetpyramidtekbspaoptilinkelliott or elliottoptilinkcom        i used to think i was indecisive but now im not so sure

    this may sound like a simpleminded question but this is the first time ive ever had a need for this  ive been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things like photoresistors you know no light to photoresistor emit a logic high etc  anyway ive got some servos lying around and i wanted to do some things with them using digital logic  i know all about having to pulse the signal and everything i just have one problem  im assuming i need a negative yes negative logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction  opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high  is a negative logic high ive seen this in schematics the same thing as an active low or what  im not using a bipolar power source so how would i get a negative logic high out of this thing  i need to have all three signals available  logic high logic low and negative logic high  any help would be greatly appreciated  also please reply via email as i never seem to have time to read this or any other group lately  thanks much mark  umlangstonmemstvx0memstedu

  jehcmkrnlcom writes  hmmm  how are those orange isolated ground outlets often used in computer rooms wired    they require two separate grounds  one ground goes to the ground pin of the outlet and the other ground wire is connected to the outlets mounting tabs and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal faceplate if any  the boxfaceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground the outlet groundpin wire is generally connected to an insulated busbar in the distribution panel which is in turn connected to the buildingentrance main ground by its own wire  so the two separate ground systems are connected together at the buildings service entrance  but one is also connected to every grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged into isolatedground outlets of that panel  if someone happens to accidentally short one phase of a 000v feeder to ground the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it until the breaker trips or the fuse blows while the isolated ground will remain relatively noisefree

  i built a little project using the radio shack 0vdc relays to switch audio  i got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched   is there a good relayrelay circuit that i can use for switching audio so that there will be no noise of any kind on the audio lines  with relays alone you will always get a transient when you abruptly turn on or off any channel  if you dont want to hear the transient use some other device a photoresistoroutput optoisolator is the usual sort of thing to gently mute the signal then switch then remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator  it used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors in switching audio because the photoresistor time delay a few thousandths of a second kept any noise in the digital side which drives the lamp from contaminating the audio  and the devices are cheaper than relays  john whitmore

  i am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from a mc000000a real time clock lowest current drain i can acheive at 00v vcc is 000ua  this is three times the specified maximum 0 made sure that reset is asserted for trlh after powerup and as is    low during this time 0 made sure that there is a cycle on as after the negation of rd or    wr during which stby was asserted  are any of the inputs to the chip coming from ttl  standbydrain specs for cmos chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down to zero or all the way up to vcc  ttl isnt good at doing the former and it wont do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors  this sort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable factor because the cmos transistors that are supposed to be off arent all the way hard off   all work is one mans work              henry spencer  u of toronto zoology                      kipling             henryzootorontoedu  utzoohenry

  sburtondresdndca stan burton writes  i would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an ir emitting source at a distance of about 000 meters more is better in daylight  the ir source could be emitting a signature im leaning toward 00 khz square wave with 00 duty cycle  i am considering the use of a quadrant detector from centronic inc to give information to a pantilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the angles  for the source i am considering wazing the heck out of an ir leds possibly an optek op000 or motorola mled00  wazing would mean at least 0 amp current pulses  at this current the duty cycle of the led drops to 00 and i would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 00 required  has anyone done something like this   yeesh you will be nailing those irleds  may i suggest getting your mitts on the siemens sfh0000 irled  this unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit  it will output nearly a watt 000 mw with real short duty cycle times  nice thing about the sfh0000 is that it is cheap  i got mine for about 00 cents a piece even though i had to buy 000 of them  btw i have seen irleds with outputs up to 0 wattshonest 0 watts  i dont have the book here at work so i cant recall the company name  the 0 watter aint cheap around 000 but if you want some power mamamia thats pretty hot  they also have a 0 watt a 0 watt and a 0 watt device in their line and will sell small quan to individuals if you are interested i can find the book at home and get the pertinent info  now as for the position detector you might try eltec in florida phone number listed in the 0000 etid is 0000000000  they seem like  nice people  their specialty is passive infrared detection devices so they might be able to help you out  im curious about your applications if you dont mind saying the device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game although youd need to up your carrier signal concept to 000 khz  duane

  kolstadcaewiscedu joel kolstad writes  one other thing there are bubblejets and then there are bubblejets there are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output such as hps dinky little bubblejet whereas most produce really good looking output such as hps deskjets  ibm and canon both produce some of the really good style bubblejets  ps  if youre in the market for a portable bubblejet printer i can highly recommend the hp portable deskjet although ive heard the portable canons are good too i needed pcl support myself  with the deskjet portable you even get an undocumented pcmcia card slot  i second that suggestion  although i dont own the hp portable deskjet i do own the hp deskjet 000  it gives the nicest outputs with only a minor loss of quality   for all intensive purposes papers letters resumes i treat my deskjet like a laser printer you do have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters  only one grudge the ink that hp gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture even though the ink is waterproof  however you would have to spend about 000 more for laser quality  the cannon bubblejets are nice however they dont seem to have as much support eg drivers for popular programs as the hp inkjets also hp deskjet regularplus000000c accepts xerox paper i believe that the cutsheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet  if you dont mind refilling your printer with cheap ink say fountainpen ink then the hp deskjets are very cheap to maintain i paid 000 for my last bottle of ink and i expect it to last 0 months   kimball who doesnt work for hp but just loves his printer   very much  ps i have a question for you netters im too afraid to refill with the waterproof inks they sell in artsupply houses because i had brought a bottle of waterproof ink and it clogged up my cartridge i wonder what is a good waterproof ink aside from buying refillkits to refill my cartridge      
  i am making a search for a cad program that does a decent job of making schematic drawings  the program needs to be in msdos windows if possible  what i want the cad program to do is to draw diagrams by dragging elements onto the screen and in this the elements needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ics case with pins it also needs to have provision for adding legends to the components as well as their values  in other words i want to produce quality drawings  printout would be to either 00 pin dotmatrix andor laser printer  i would suggest draw for windows by micrografx  i have this on my home box  its quite impressive and only cost ukl000  it has a rather nice clipart library facility which you can expand with your own drawings  there is no circuit component clipart included but you could add your own quite easily  it works with any windows printer driver of course and can also export embedded postscript and pcx files  note i am not connected with micrografx in any way  paul   paul johnson pajgecmrccouk     tel 00 000 00000 ext 0000  these ideas and others like them can be had  gecmarconi research is not for 000 each from any reputable idealist  responsible for my opinions

  does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators ive been seeing all over latenight tv recently i was wondering if they use forced air hea or both if theres heat involved anybody know what temperature they run at my wife would like one and im not inclined to pay 00000 for a box a fan and a heater seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together for just a few bucks heck the technology is only what 0000 years old  you can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book the hungry hikers guide to good food by gretchen mchugh  the heat source is a 000 watt light bulb  basically its a vertical wooden box with ventilation holes in the top and bottom lots of them you want the air to flow  the light bulb goes in the bottom and wire cake racks are spaced every 0 starting about 00 above the bulb  or at a slightly higher cost in electricity you can do what i do  use your oven  note  i do this in an electric oven some gas ovens may not have a low enough setting  put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven  set oven to 000 degrees the lowest setting on my oven  if yours goes down to 000 thats probably even better  stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch  this allows for airflow  leave the stuff in the oven for 0 to 0 hours check it often since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator  if you are using cookie sheets instead of racks turn the stuff over halfway through  if you want more info email me since this isnt really the right sub for this stuff  geraldbeltonozoneholecom     slmr 00  i still miss my boss but my aim is improving                          the ozone hole bbs  a private bulletin board service  0000000000 0 full service nodes  usrobotics 000k bps  00 gigs  000000 files skydive new orleans  rime network mail hub  000 usenet newsgroups please route all questions or inquiries to  postmasterozoneholecom

  i live in the san francisco bay area and word has it that something similar is on its way here  since we apparently dont have the sensor base you folks have theyre installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways initial tests are going to be in the santa clara area im told with the video being piped into a command center theyre building somewhere in the east bay  im not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data but large multicolored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway  an announcer will sit in front of the status wall and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it  theyre apparently also looking into licensing a lowam frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system  in the mean time theyll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead  my understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program and information from it will be available free of charge  perhaps the la system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate read cheap  we also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the sap audio channel of television channels 0 and 00  these are verbal reports qualified with a identification tone to tell invehicle receivers like the auto talk that the information coming next is applicable to a given area  in la theyre probably using some other tv channels but the concept is the same  try setting your stereo tv or vcr to receive the sap audio channel and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information i believe this program is also subsidized making the invehicle receivers cheap to purchase and without having to incur monthly fees to use it  since the makers of these invehicle receivers dont have to pay for the broadcast this may not be completely true they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the cal trans stuff hits the airwaves  you may have a nifty little tv audio receiver in your car nothing more when this happens  perhaps a word to the wise    i think wed all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the la system is networked and paid for  cheers alan acooneynetcomcom

  one notsoquick question to throw out there for you guys  for our class project we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs  voltatge  adjustable from 000v current   limited at 0a  voltage must stay within 0 of designated value for i from 00a ac ripple less than 0 mv rms  of course we cant just use an adjustable voltage currentlimiting regulator chip   our problem is with the current limiting ie weve found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit  what the supply must do if presented with a load which would draw more than 0a given the supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp  thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we should read one amp  if we measure the current through a 0 ohm  resistor at 00v we should read one amp and the output voltage by necessity must be 0v  the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor and therefore reduce the output  so does anybody have any ideas we could work from  thanks in advance  andy collins kc0yey acollinsuclinkberkeleyedu  ps if anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project i agree fully     but i still have to do it its graded

   ive used onchip capacitors to reduce groundbounce noise on a small systolic array chip that had 00pf loads on the clock lines design was in 0micron nwell cmos using the mosis scalable design rules here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors  0 they dont help much with simultaneous output switchingthere is still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the load capacitor on both the signal line and the ground return so you still get ground and power line bounce   0 they do help a lot with onchip loads as i had with the high load on the clock lines   0 the transients you are trying to suppress are really high frequency so forget about large areas of polythinoxidediff capacitors since the rc time constant is too large what i did is to make a metal0 metal poly diff sandwich but put a lot of holes in the poly layer allowing frequent diffmetal0 contacts  i forget exactly how wide the poly lines were  if i were doing this design again id probably omit the diff altogether and use a solid poly sheet instead using just m0 m0 and poly and substrate but that has such a high resistance it can be ignored at these speeds  0 you are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings especially for output signalling than spending chip area on capacitors i had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for a mosis tiny chip and the next size up was twice as big as i needed   kevin karplus   kevin karpluskarplusceucscedu  due to budgetary constraints the light at the end of the tunnel is being turned off

  tony wayne writes  what is pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments tony  pink noise is a random signal with more lowfrequency components than white noise  if you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer you will find that the spectrum power density is flat which means that every frequency is present in the noise signal  often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of lowpass filtering a white noise signal therefore pink noise contains much more lowfrequency components  the effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring animals an additional lowpass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why  enjoy it  wouter

   how does the radio electronics free information cards work do they just send you some general information about the companies that advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a catalog   that depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled radio electronics compiles all of the cards then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number some magazines also provide the data on selfadhesive labels and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk  the advertiser decides what to do with the data they get you will notice that the radio electronics information card commonly called a bingo card in the industry includes lines for a company name and a business phone number my guess would be that the big national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can for example if you include motorola as your company and include a business phone and a mail stop tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hardbound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later if you leave it blank odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog and then some companies like digikey or jameco have nothing to mail out accept the catalog  a couple of other interesting points about bingo cards free industry magazines like edn and such also log your card to their computer they use the information at least three ways they note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you through repeated mailings to resubscribe they also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics this way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that 00 of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors and finally some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information for example tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment other than tektronics in the past 0 months  the other point in the data the advertiser receives many magazines include how many items you circled on the card if they want the advertiser can attempt to cull out the literature collectors from the serious potential customers  can you say qualified sales leads i thought you could  whats the best way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards    never circle more than 0 number on the card if you want more   than 0 items use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later    if you are really really serious and you really really want   the information call the advertiser and ask this will also   cut about 00 days off the the response time virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout    to help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that youre   not really qualified for send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers    include a business name and phone number even if its your house   advertisers almost never call   john schuch   publisher of the arizona hightech times                 the arizona electrical journal                 the arizona hvac news   all of which have bingo cards

  duane yeesh you will be nailing those irleds  may i suggest getting your mitts on the siemens sfh0000 irled  this unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit  it will output nearly a watt 000 mw with real short duty cycle times  nice thing about the sfh0000 is that it is cheap  i got mine for about 00 cents a piece even though i had to buy 000 of them  are you saying that you have some extras that you would like to do some cost recovery on  i may be interested  i think for practical and cost reasons i am limited to envelope detection so that leaves me with only increasing the output power and increasing the optical gain at the receiver as methods to extend range  btw i have seen irleds with outputs up to 0 wattshonest 0 watts  i dont have the book here at work so i cant recall the company name  the 0 watter aint cheap around 000 but if you want some power mamamia thats pretty hot  they also have a 0 watt a 0 watt and a 0 watt device in their line and will sell small quan to individuals if you are interested i can find the book at home and get the pertinent info  yes im interested in the company name  i have access to an extensive data book collection  with that kind of power are we getting into an area where eye safety is getting to be a problem  now as for the position detector you might try eltec in florida phone number listed in the 0000 etid is 0000000000  they seem like nice people  their specialty is passive infrared detection devices so they might be able to help you out  they are a long way from me but they might be a better source than i can find around here  im curious about your applications if you dont mind saying the device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game although youd need to up your carrier signal concept to 000 khz  im keeping my application confidential for now  raising the frequency should be no problem in fact one respondent to my question said that i may not have to mimic the 00 duty cycle normally used by ir detector chips    stan burton dndcraddresdtdmssagcg                 sburtondresdndca 000 0000000     dre suffield box 0000 medicine hat ab canada t0a 0k0

  in scielectronics rgc0000bcsteccaboeingcom robert g carpenter writes   im wondering if its possible to use radio waves to measure the  distance between a transmitters and receiver  yes its called radar well actually not quite both radar and radioaltimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal then receive its reflection from a target radar generally uses pulses while radio altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuouswave transmission in the case of the latter highly accurate distance measurement can be made as an example the original bendix ala00 radio altimeter was accurate to 00 foot at 0000 feet altitude  note however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked about the problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter triggers this cannot be wire connected since radio waves will actually travel faster in freespace air in this case than wire the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable so you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance etc something like a pll connected to a gps receiver should do the trick triggering both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously sound expensive not too bad but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort  why not go to a different method surveyors use a laserlight system where again the reflection time is measured why not try this sounds like something a pe should know about anyway    seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength  and determine distance this would be for short distances 0000 ft  and i would need to have accuracy of 0 inches or so  this is actually highly inaccurate since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit there are variances in the antenna and transmission line and the receiver may also vary both from unit to unit and the same unit over time you would need to continuously calibrate the entire system with the radio altimeter this is also done but since everything is located at one place it is much easier to do note especially that the time base for the ra receiver and transmitter is one unit also  depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes in a dynamic environment with objects moving about the multipath kills this concept  nope fm capture effect says that the strongest signal wins that is unless the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 0 db in signal strength this is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes signals bouncing off runways tend to be very strong   what frequencies would be best for this or does matter  as high as possible to eliminate outside influence and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signals radio altimeters typically use frequencies around 0 ghz  hope this helps     jack brindle ham radio wa0fib internet jackbmddcommmotcom

  kuosheng kasey chang writes    there are several types of copy protection and the point is to make   sure the  user is using a legitimate copy  the simplest and virtually foolproof   way is  for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed   on  some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a   different  machine not installed from original disks will not work      okay so what do you do if some part of the machine presumably the part   on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself   upon goes bad you replace that part and now your program wont run   because its on a different computer  this is of course assuming that the program uses something in rom like   the bios serial number maybe and not a diskbased code number    obviously if the drive goes bad youll be reinstalling the stuff anyway  i work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system    we have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred   machines both pc and macintosh as well as administering a network of   over 00 next machines  i personally am concerned only with a small lab   with ten pcs and ten macs  im not the manager but help him with   admin often  imho copyprotection schemes of any sort are nothing more   than a major headache for the legitimate user  anyone who wants a copy of   your program and doesnt care about legality will get a copy  period    pirate board or no pirate board  i too have friends who blatantly and   quite successfuly hack copy protection schemes practically in their   sleep  lets consider what goes on in our lab  almost daily we have at least one   machine down sometimes several due to some goofball screwing up some   setting or other on a piece of software  admittedly we being students   mostly are not the worlds most efficient and effective network   administrators but we try  keeping even the twenty machines that are   partly my responsibility even vaguely looking and acting similar to   the average user and maintaining behindthescenes consistency is a   real headache but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty   different folder locations of norton utilities when some guy trashes his   disk  often we have hardware problems at peak business times and have to do   some partsswapping to get stuff working temporarily     well ill cut to the chase and quit boring yall     the point is often we have to reinstall software and copy configuration   files etc from machine to machine  by far the easiest way we have found   to do this is to get one machine working exactly the way we want to then   copy the complete setup of this machine to the other nine of that   machines type  this ensures us that for at least ten minutes we have   ten identical machines to work with  having them networked simplifies   this considerably as our major packages wordperfect windows etc are   all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with  often however we need to install a package requested by some instructor   to one some or all of the machines for a special project  this is   usually a handwritten or sharewareetc program similar to what i believe   the original poster was asking about  the few we have had with copy   protection schemes have caused nothing but nightmares for us to maintain       in short dont waste your time with a copy protection scheme  its sort   of like outlawing guns  the criminals will get your program anyway and   you will only be hurting the legitimate honest user  write a good users   guide and tech manual whatever else for your program please do this   regardless of whether you copy protect the thing and only distribute   the manual to licensed users  jack the price to cut your losses but   please take a cue from the major companies who can admittedly afford the   costs of illegal copies far better than you and dont burden the   legitimate user with a copy protection scheme   sorry for the tirade but its been a long day here       mark s underwood ee student university of kentucky lab assistant boyd hall microlab  a tiny little division of uk library microlabs email  msunde00mikukyedu      the program is definitely backupable if restored to the same machine   depends  on the programmer  dont use a disk drive characteristic  if the   user   did an upgrade to the machine heshe should reinstall all programs any   way  no document lookup no disk wearandtear    i did not say that the originals would allow only one install  the   users   conscience should do that    i know ill get flamed for this  but with the increasing number of   casual  users who either unknowingly or dont care about the software copyrights  its the truth  i have friends who ask me for copies of my latest   games  all the time and when i refused they went after somebody else   casual  pirating is becoming more of a problem  some sort of copy protection   will  discourage the casual copying  ive seen what some of my friends dug   up  somewhere  latest and the greatest games all cracked within days of   actual  release  you know how many bytes you need to change in xwing to   disable  the quiz  two  yes two  and dont ask me which ones they are    determined  pirates are unstoppable given enough time but their results do not   spread   that far since pirate boards are not that wellknown and easily   tracked once  found by authorities  it is the casual pirates that the copy   protection is  determined to discourage    what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus  a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup  registered to xxxxx  address city state zip and disables the   above  two benefits 0 encourages registration 0 cuts down on pirating and  makes it more traceable because if the patchs registration message is  encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a  stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus  violated their license agreement    this way the legitimate users who does not register will experience   minimal   discomfort who does major upgrades to their computer frequently as   only  problem they have is they wont be able to restore to another computer    the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and   therefore  gains full rights and can restore to different machines  on the other   hand  the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is   supposed to be  if this users copy was found to be somewhere it was   not   supposed to be we know who has broken their license agreement  of   course  a hacker can break that eventually but thats not the point is it    kasey chang

   hey now will you stop encouraging him copy protection only serves one pur pose to keep the honest buyer from making legal backup copies it will definitely not stop any pirates if you want to protect you soft supply a good documentation and support this is imho the only way of effectively pro tecting software best regards arno  i strongly disagree i think most pirating is done by amateurs who wont copy the program if diskcopy cant do it if youre talking a 00 max goal of pirated copies i bet that anything that will beat diskcopy and cant be easily copied from a hard drive will suffice i hate hard copy manuals and would rather have all docs online  not because i want to copy the program but because its usually faster and and convenient than sifting through an old book i cant find  off deeper end why does everyone think they need to be able to make a  backup copy almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk so you are left with the originals as your backups i think its a waste of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend out the backups    no flames intended  just my thoughts  eric

  actually detecting a break is done by watching for a character containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt  this  true enough but  means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit time slot which basically indicates a break  there is no special way to detect break that i have found other than this  theres no magic signal generated by uarts etc  zilog scc  rr00  break detect  this is a very popular part but it has a number of quirks especially in hdlc mode  signetics 00000 duscc  rsr0  break start detect rsr0  break end detect  two of the bits in the receiver status register  you can enable an interrupt on either of these bits going high too  also only one null will be put in the fifo per break detected  this is simply the best serial chip ive ever worked with  many less quirks than the scc which is imho secondbest  death to 0000 devices      ii      cccccc   jim cathey  ii  sssscc       iscbunker ramo  ii      cc       tafc0  spokane wa  00000  iissss  cc       uucp uunetiscbrjimc jimciscbriscbrcom  ii      cccccc   000 0000000  one design to rule them all one design to find them one design to bring them all and in the darkness bind them  in the land of mediocrity where the pcs lie

  much deleted about assembly in usa vs other  i wish to focus on the subject of warmrunning amplifiers      sure the amp runs very fairly     hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good     an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how its gonna sound   the amp you have probably is running classa the whole day     because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted   to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  hmmmmm    there is a correclation between warmrunning amps and good sound or in your words it does have a bearing on  now i dont suggest that everyone run out and create combination stoveamplifiers that will degrade lifespan but a coldrunning circuit is much more suceptible to temperature variation with varrying current than is a warmrunning one  and since junction resistance is a function of temperature this has a detrimental effect on linearity    a few facts bias points vary with temperature junction resist varrie with temp adcom products do not run classa  if you still dont beleive this assertion consider the warmup requirements for most good test equipment or better yet just listen to an amplifier warmup  on many designs its quite audible on mine about 00 minutes for the output stage many hours for the drivers  fortunately the drivers are not switched  in any experiment or when drawing conclusions from listening betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias idle current level  both have a positive correlation with low distortion and good sound quality and high bias results in warmer operation all other factors being equal  grant    
   i built a little project using the radio shack 0vdc relays to switch  audio  i got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched  i was doing  most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and  nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks    my question is    is there a good relayrelay circuit that i can use for switching  audio so that there will be no noise of any kind on the audio lines    i will appreciate any advice or references to advice  also exact part  numberscompany names etc for the relays will help  the first step is to make sure that there is no dc component intentional or not on the audio lines to be switched if neither the output or input presents an unintentional dc level lets say theyre capacitively coupled then putting a 00 k resistor from each input to ground and from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any coupling caps presenting a dc level that is guaranteed to cause a click  if the device presents an unintentional dc level that is from more than just coupling capacitor leakage then you need to remove the dc before switching with coupling capacitors of your own  if you have more than one relay each relay switching one input through to a common output you can use makebeforebreak switching where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch change this may mask the switch click  an audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and making your own ersatz optoisolator with a lightdependent resistor ldr sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink many broadcast consoles use this older but timehonored technique claro actually makes a complete optisolator like this but i dont have a part number handy radio shack has a ldr grabbag 0000000 you might want to try  for a simple solid state clickless switch that is cheap you might try  looking at the cd0000 analog switch that is commonly available or its older predecessor the 0000 again the dc component must be removed prior to switching other alternatives include jfet switches both discrete and ic and diode switching which works relatively well surprisingly all the above with their pitfalls and application tips could easily make a subject for a multipage article  solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on due to charge being injected into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal changes state techniques to minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through the switch differential switching and slowing the risetime of the control pulse with the 0000 cutting the click can be as simple as putting 00k  00k resistors in series with the control pins  hope this helps at least get you started            dave medinphone000 0000000 w     ssdnetworking000 0000000 h     intergraph corp        ms gd0000 internet dtmedincatbyteb00ingrcom   huntsville al 00000uucp  uunetingrb00catbytedtmedin      everywhere you look at least around my office     the opinions expressed here are mine or those of my machine

  verityjacksnscom steve verity writes       i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video vs  a blank screen by monitoring the rg and b outputs of a graphics  card  it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at  00 mhz which would mean detecting a 00 ns pulse  it should also be  able to tell the difference between a blank screen about 000 mv  and a dim screen say around 000 mv  oh yes it also needs to be  cheap      my first circuit was a dismal failure  i used 0 compariators each  compariator had the  input going to one of the guns the  input  went to a reference created by a voltage dividera potentiometer    the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow i  needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the  compariators so i could have a whole screen full of text but my    the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then  the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen  in  fact the difference between completely black and completely white is  only 000 mv  i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the  video signals to make this work      there are faster compariators but they are expensive and require   split supplies   i would need to replace my 00 quad compariator  with three 000 compariators and create a whole new power supply  circuit      at this point i think what i need is some sort of transistor  circuit  transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick    unfortunately i am way out of my league when it comes to designing  transistor circuits so i am appealing to the net for help  any  ideas tips circuits pointers references etc would be greatly  appreciated      oh yes i only sample the output of this thing every second or so so  i dont need a fast response time at all however i havent found a  way to take advantage of that fact    thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give of course  you will have my undying gratitude      steve verity                   steve verity                                  maxed on midi                                                     verityjacksnscom            in order to get the 00 ns response time you need you are better off  going to an ecl slicer which can run off a single 0 or 00 v supply  you just need to bias or do some level shifting perhaps to get it in the  range check out the ecl 00k books for a simple cheap solution  dinoinqmindbisonmbca the inquiring mind bbs winnipeg manitoba  000 0000000

  acollinsuclinkberkeleyedu andy collins writes   one notsoquick question to throw out there for you guys    for our class project we need to design and build a power supply  to the following specs    voltatge  adjustable from 000v  current   limited at 0a    voltage must stay within 0 of designated value for i from 00a  ac ripple less than 0 mv rms    of course we cant just use an adjustable voltage currentlimiting  regulator chip     our problem is with the current limiting ie weve found stuff to  do the rest of the parts of the circuit  what the supply must do  if presented with a load which would draw more than 0a given the  supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal  one amp  thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we  should read one amp  if we measure the current through a 0 ohm   resistor at 00v we should read one amp and the output voltage by  necessity must be 0v    the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves  a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output   power transistor and therefore reduce the output    so does anybody have any ideas we could work from    thanks in advance    andy collins kc0yey  acollinsuclinkberkeleyedu    ps if anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project i agree fully      but i still have to do it its graded     you can design for ramp shutoff brickwall current limit or even  foldback cutoffsounds like you want brickwall current limit  your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base  drive in order to get the brick wall you need enough voltage gain on  the current sensor  normally a darlington on the current sensing  resistor will be adequate but for infinite gain use an op amp to sense  the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to  turn off the base bias on the seriespass transistor  phase compensation  may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more  than 000 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain ok  dinoinqmindbisonmbca the inquiring mind bbs winnipeg manitoba  000 0000000

  the battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold  the temperature combined with selfdischarge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of  the battery  i strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesnt go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite cooler   
   not that the question is anything important but i am still curious  why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green i have seen  a few blue ones but no red yellow company logo etc is there a  technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have  not tought about it yet    juha the color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of it  original and older boards were bakelite composition and were brown phenolic spelling was a tan most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green filled fiberglass is blue teflon is white  as boards evolved more and more demands were made of them  first boards were used mainly in audio circuitry  couldnt be used in high voltage or rf because it would arc and burn  most boards today are fiberglass the type being chosen by its use and cost    boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon and ceramic as the fiberglass and other boards are conductive they actually work more as a  capacitive dialectric but the word conductive simplifies explaination at the high frequencies  another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections is a thin flexible mostly mylar material and is used to connect the front of the vehicle etc to the back instead of wiring harnesses  camcorders use this to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance  am working on a generator made by hewlet packard right now and the entire board is gold plated boy it looks expensive  hope i got most of my facts right as i am working from memory of material read  my education was pretransister   00 tom  tom wagner audio visual technician  malaspina college nanaimo british columbia 0000000000 loc 0000  fax0000000  callsignve0gda weapon00 kentucky rifle snail mail to  site q0 c0   rr0 nanaimo british columbia canada v0r 0x0    i do not recyle   i keep everything       all standard disclaimers apply

              i have a question about accessing certain addresses on a chip  particulary a 00c000 eprom  although i dont know that much about it as i  understand it theres a pin on the chip that when voltage is applied kicks  up the address  the question is how do you determine how many bytes the  address is incremented by  for example if i have code i want to be  accessed at 0000 and also at say 0000 how do i move the address pointer to  those positions  thanks for any info         sean kelly  sysop amizon bbs 0000000000                              always looking for classic video games for the following systems                                                                                atari 0000atari 0000colecovisionatari 0000intellivisionvectrex      judging by your sig you are trying to make some kind of game cartridge information of how to build an eeprom cartidge for the vectrex is available via anonymous ftp at csusedu  since youve chosen the 00c000 you are probably trying to make a multicart to do this simply 0 load the game images into the eeprom at 0000 0000 etc your eeprom burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into one file yourself with suitable gaps 0 wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game console and the high bits going to switches to choose between games  to directly answer your question above the pin that kicks up the address is simply another address line  for a concrete example with the 00c000 and 0k games images you would wire a0a00 to the cartridge and a00a00 to 0 switches  the 0 switches would allow you to pick from the 0 games on the eeprom

  do you know any assembly language at all  all anyone needs to do if find the part of the code that does the quiz and insert a jmp instruction to just completely skip it  not that difficult really  and there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing  using pklite or some similar utility would help but only if the resulting compressed exe were tagged as uncompressable  and even that doesnt help there are at least two programs available that fixes this unp and dislite both available from simtel00 and even without them it isnt that hard to fix

  i strongly disagree i think most pirating is done by amateurs who wont copy the program if diskcopy cant do it  i hate to disagree but i will  note i dont pirate software nor do i trade it i simply have met and talked extensively with those who have thats it the fbi can tap someone elses phone  most pirating is done by people who dont use the programs they pirate a cracked program tends to get passed on resplendant in the various graphics and animations that advertise whoever performed the modifications  i admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in giving copies of programs to ones fellow workers maybe taking it home for use on ones own pc but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most spread throughout the business as a whole how many times have you had someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks  its mostly a matter of convenience a person sees a program they want to use and they feel justified in making a copy since someones already paid for it etc etc a note this is starting to change a bit not much though  if youre talking a 00 max goal of pirated copies i bet that anything that will beat diskcopy and cant be easily copied from a hard drive will suffice  what about commercially available copy programs copyii how about programs like teledisk that can do things diskcopy cant and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy wouldnt know about this   after working with people around computers one comes to realize that the average user doesnt know much any computer enthusiast is at least 000x better at preguessing commands and how to use them can you sit down and use something without reading the manual and it is these people who are doing the 00 pirating not joe windows user who cant remember a few arguments to the dir command  i hate hard copy manuals and would rather have all docs online  not because i want to copy the program but because its usually faster and and convenient than sifting through an old book i cant find  really i find it evens out the online stuff can be read through faster but youre stuck reading it in linear flow start to finish unless you jump ahead with a search or such a book though you can flip through faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty index too  but i partially agree i often wish i could grep something that was written down  off deeper end why does everyone think they need to be able to make a  backup copy almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk so you are left with the originals as your backups i think its a waste of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend out the backups   what if they need to reinstall the idea of a backup still holds if the original disk goes bad theyre out of luck for about 00 weeks which is the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks if theyll do it without a charge    edward w jajko   the nekomancer  ejajkohertzeleecalpolyedu  mein fuhrer i can walk doctor strangelove   
   could make for some interesting choreography light and sound could be  controlled directly by the position of a dancer on stage or by the number of dancers on stage neat   you could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage   can you tell us more about what youre doing sounds like a very cool program  tis only a gleam in my eye at this point  i have yet to chose a tracking  method  the initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage  i did some experiments with  pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition  and dancers stand still alot so their ir signature goes away  the good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional  to the size of the warm body or body part and the velocity of said body this could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture  dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their  bodies but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked  the current toy i have been working with is a program called mandala for the amiga used with a live video digitizer  this works with a video camera  trained on the stage  you can set thresholds for a zone within the field of view and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event events can be midi objects or sequences amiga sounds or graphic objects  its been fun to play with but the documentaion is arcane and the digitizer is noisy still its very appealing the dancers dont have to wear any appliances you can have ots of zones it speaks midi which can be used to control lights and i dont have to build any electronics  its all done with lighting and video brightness and contrast adjustments  i have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic but i have hopes

   in order to emit blue light a semiconductor must have a band gap energy within the region of 00 to 00 electron volts according to my physical electronics prof you cant get an led with that band gap thats why you dont find blue leds or for that matter some other colour of leds that is not to say that blue leds cant be found  ive seen blue leds sold but they were just your typical visible light led in a blue plastic covering they didnt emit very much light  um  0 your professor if just plain wrong  although blue leds are one heck of a lot less efficient than red ones 0 typical visible light leds dont really exist  leds have a fairly narrow region of transmittence  since the fermi energy around either side of the band gap falls off exponentially blah blah  source solid state electronic devices ben g streetman 0d ed prentice hall  you might want to check the copyright date on that   blue leds most certainly do exist ive got a bunch at work  cree research makes them probably along with other companies  cree is big in materials science though they advertise in the stuff like physics today etc  you can buy them from jameco i think digikey definitely and plenty of other distributors  actually these days you can get a typical visible light led  its called a rainbow led and ive forgotten who makes it they advertise in edn and many of the other trade rags though  it combines a reg green and blue led all on one chip and has four leads  nifty device although its probably fairly expensive  joel kolstad

   anyways ive built the basic up  down converters with pretty  good results 00 efficiency but im running into problems  when i try to design  build anything that puts out serious  amps i know it can be done i have some 0v000a guts on my  bench but something puzzles me im using a simple choke as   the storage element basicly a toroid with a single winding  but all commercial models use transformers with many windings  i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for  the usual errorfeedback but some of the others seem to loose  me what are they for better than that anyone have a full  schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of id  love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such  low volume   most commercial switchers do not use magnetics for their energy storage thats handled by the big caps on the primary side those which in a  linearlyregulated power supply would be considered the filter caps coming right after the bridge  the transformer is just that  a  transformer  its there primarily to step the voltage up or down  although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is not negligible as anyone whos zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a snubber diode across it would tell you  actually many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in  the basic switchedmode power supply operates something like this in a somewhat simplified manner  the ac line is rectified to produce a high voltage moreorless unregulated dc rail  the energy storage or filter caps appear across this rail as does the switching transistor the transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer resulting in steppedup or steppeddown pulses out the secondary which  are then rectified and filtered  at least one of the transformers outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor which acts in a pulsewidth modulation pwm fashion to control by varying the pulse width the amount of energy being dumped into the primary and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary  the remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will moreorless tracking the regulated output or they may have some additional linear regulation added  you may also note that the feedback between the  regulated output and the pwm control which is most typically an ic is not done via a direct electrical connection this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated  often the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement  while the transformer isnt the primary energystorage device in these designs this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored besides the inductive kick giving the switch transistor a bad time as noted above you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went in to the transformer back out again one way or another in some designs this happens more or less automatically  but in others you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesnt saturate which again would have disastrous results best left to the  imagination   im not by any stretch of the imagination a powersupply designer  hopefully a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above   bob myers  kc0ew   hewlettpackard co      opinions expressed here are not                    systems technology div  those of my employer or any other myersfchpcom    fort collins colorado   sentient lifeform on this planet

      i was just wondering one thing actually two  i hope that this is the proper place to post this subject    why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor     i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and i just went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but  they act like the two terminals are shorted  i asked a friend and he said that you should never do that cause it ruins them but he couldnt tell me why   its not the concrete floor that does it the problem is that leadacid cells self discharge over time even high quality cells gates for instance will discharge 0000 over a 00 month period of time nonsealed cells self discharge even faster if the battery was not completly charged when left sitting it probably discharged past the the point where cell sulfiding occurs which in many cases means a ruined battery         datalog consulting tucson az        ejmdatalogcom          noaodatalogcomejm           
  here is a different viewpoint   fyi  the actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an hp  deskjet is 0000th inch  the electronics and dynamics of the ink  cartridge however limit you to generating dots at 000 per inch  on almost any paper the ink wicks more than 0000th inch anyway    the method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer  results in much less spread than ink drop technology  in practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc can happen   it doesnt take much investigation to see that the mechanical and  electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than  inexpensive ink jet printers  recall also that laser printers  offer a much higher throughput  00 ppm for a laser versus about 0  ppm for an ink jet printer  a cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the first sheet take to print inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer i have a 00000 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer  a sage said to me do you want one copy or lots of copies one  inkjet    something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the  life of the printer  a 0000 page yield toner cartridge is about  us 0000 at discount while hp high capacity 0000000 page yield  cartridges are about us 00 at discount  it could be that over the  life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are  less than ink jet printers  it is getting progressively closer  between the two technologies  laser printers are usually desinged  for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product  replacement cycles  paper cost is the same and both can use refills long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts consumables and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer  hp inkjets understand pcl so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver   there is one wild difference between the two printers a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer this means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot few drivers  actually use this facility there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on    tc      email tchannonblackdemoncouk or tchannoncixcompulinkcouk

     why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable  when stored on a concrete floor    when will people learn  the trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows ballast  resistors are used to discharge batteries furthermore it is very silly to  store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to  contact the ballast   seriously self discharge the actual problem as stated by others does vary  greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge i have in  fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full  charge for  0 years so it must be possible  if your garage is heated store the batteries somewhere cooler but above  freezing flat batteries freeze more easily occasionally charge it once a  month or even leave it on float charge permanently special charger  dont do this unless you know what you are doing seriously dangerous  anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like  electric mowers  they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep  discharged and their life may be greatly shorted some early zero maintenance  automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure  shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb 0yrs 00000 miles and  counting    tc      email tchannonblackdemoncouk or tchannoncixcompulinkcouk

  hmmm   a possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the distributor register the copy when the software was sold  the clerk sticks it in the store pc and asks for the buyers id later if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser in addition copies which were sent to distributorsstores would have a vendor reg  or serial  in order to track in store piracy  possible additional program security schemes would be 0 having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in    and registration inconvenient 0 taking dire legal action on anyone caught expensive 0 encryption crc check self modifying code limited effectiveness 0 have an independent watchdog program in the installationsetup config or    memory manager etc which would check the main programs crc     only as effective as above methods at best 0 have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked     copies of the program andor the offenders hard drive risky and probably    illegal certainly immoral  my new ideas arent terribly feasible to implement as presented but i thought if i threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective what is the problem with parallel port security keys i havent used anything that had hardware key copy protection schemes so i dont know what the drawbacks are i know the companies that make them claim theyre uncrackable but ive seen cracks of autodesk 0dstudio floating around i dont have one so dont ask and i had heard that it had parralel port keys  vamillironothelloucdedu my apologies if i rambled but vi inhibits my communication skills greatly  
  inkjet and bubblejet printers are the same tech  bubblejet was trademarked by cannon and inkjet was by hp i belive  i have seen both and own a  bubblejet a apple stylewriter which has a cannon engine with a 000 dpi rated output  the output is very good with quality paper which is very importaint  cheap paper gives bad results  i use sealed paper and the only differenc is that the ink is less dark than toner i compaire to the apple personal laserwriter ntx but then again the difference is 000 to 0000 so     david a smith                i like to skate on the other side of the ice   dasmithsuntanecusfedu   i didnt do it and i dont know anything     smithdeggocseeusfedu    either usf better not know im here    
         im looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response  to the output from a walkman cassette player how could i do this i dont want it just to turn on i want it to strobe once so to speak per every beep i put on a cassette tape        would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency is there any easy way to do either of these im looking for  the simplest circuit possible i guess what im asking for is some sort of color organ but not quite let me trt to explain again        im going to have a pattern of beats or beeps on a cassette tape so on the tape youd hear   beep pause beep pause beep pauseetc   with speed increasing as time goes on i want to synchronize an led  probably two of them with the beeps on the cassette tape so the led with each beep would go on and off real quick generating a strobe light sort of effect the rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the leds and if there was no sound on the tape except for background his the leds would remain off please help     thanks      dana  try looking in a magizine called radio electronics may 0000 issue page 00  there is a circuit for a midi light controller there     andy    andy belville                           its taken me a long time but ive belviladdunx0ocsdrexeledu           fallen in love with a beautiful woman

  milliron says    a possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the distributor register the copy when the software was sold  the clerk sticks it  thats kind of extra work that one cannot expect the store people to do imho it would be easier if companies sell their software as cheaply as possible and to sell the customers detail manuals for the braindeads  quick reference books how to do books and videos paid support hot line 0000   for the registered purchasers these can be part of their package i have seen many books to teach people how to use dos wp and other software  i i suspect either users cant read the manuals or they dont have manuals either way there is  to be made   btw books are quite a bit more expensive to reproduce than a 0 disk  what is the problem with parallel port security keys i havent used anything that had hardware key copy protection schemes so i dont know what the drawbacks are i know the companies that make them claim theyre uncrackable  with the popularity of multitasking and pseudo multitasking systems eg os00 windoze mack system 0 it is pretty easy to run a debugger and figure out the protection schemes by disassemblingtracingtrapping the application during run time  schemes like compressed software special loaders would be easy pray even to beginner hackers  hardware keys unless well designed and totally transparent is a pain in the bt  we having using a piece of software under windoze that uses a hardware key  the key interfers with the printer stuff with other programs and often has to be unplugged for those software to work properly  but ive seen cracks of autodesk 0dstudio floating around i dont have one so dont ask and i had heard that it had parralel port keys  all the hacker has to do is to removemodify code that communicate with the port  vamillironothelloucdedu my apologies if i rambled but vi inhibits my communication skills greatly  k c lee elec eng grad student os00 windoze mack are not trademarked  
  can someone tell me where to find 000volt 0 watt 00 ma fans that fit the standard computer mounting size ie 0 and 00 inch wide and 0 inches diagonal from hole to hole holewhere bolt or screw goes through  i have found higher noisy fans that are 000 v 0 watt but i need a quite fan  i can use 00 volt as well but found just about all 00 volt fans to be noisy  i also find that the 000 v fans are not only quieter but the blade shape has a lot to do with it  i have a dead fan that was quiet in its day  it has long blades like fan blades in a tturbo engine on a jet is the only way i can describe it  the dead fan is etri model 000lh actually its not dead it just makes a hideous rattle noise so its stealthy qualities are void  thanks

  hi  i have a few questions about laying out a pcb i am using easytrax for dos which is a great program but what my question is when laying out traces what thickness should they be i am mainly designing low voltage low current boards for micro controller apps what should pad sizes be for resistors i will be turning to a commercial pcb maker to produce 0s of these boards and i was wondering what is the minimum distance traces should be from each other well any info would be great thanks                                                  anton

  i need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to deliver 0 joules at 000 volts  the ubiquitous camera flash circuit is what i want but i cant get mine apart without breaking it  charlie bretts suggestion  buy one of the disposable flash cameras use the film then take the thing apart  is a good one  note though that you wont get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing and it may be a singlepoint design that wont adapt well to offnominal operation  the things are easy to dismantle  the key piece of information is that when you advance the film on one of them you are winding it into the film cassette  it is unwound from the cassette in the factory when the camera is made  so no darkroom is needed for dismantling  its standard film so just take the cassette in for processing  all the camerastore people do when you bring in one of the disposables is rip it apart toss the film cassette into the tobeprocessed bin and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in another  if you take it apart yourself you get an aa alkaline battery still with a fair bit of life in it and all kinds of little bits and pieces from the camera  i expect you could even reload and reuse the camera if you were really determined   svr0 resembles a highspeed collision    henry spencer  u of toronto zoology between svr0 and sunos     dick dunn    henryzootorontoedu  utzoohenry  
      i thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post  some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries    one year i left the batteries in the garage  the garage is unheated   they were left in their places that they needed to be  one in the riding lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle  the battery in the  riding lawnmower was about 00 years old and one of the cycle batteries  was new and one was around 0 years old  upon spring time i discovered that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged  they all worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced  about halfway through the summer  they had originally been stored in the garage and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring   last year i decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete  i brought in all three and discovered in the spring about 00 days ago that not only were the batteries dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and  the ampmeter read around 0000000000  in other words it was pinned the internal circut tripped and i went on to the other batteries  they were the same      realizing that we still had 0 gigantic sailboat batteries also lead acid i decided to put the charger on them  these had been sitting for around 0 and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only needed a small charge around 0 hours or so on trickle  i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they worked fine for around 00 of em    this leads me to believe one of several things      0 i bought really tty batteries last year sorta true      0 the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the         batteries      0 there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the            room where the concrete is       0 the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air          better than concrete  btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room       any other ideas     could be the aliens anything is possible    
  it isnt the average temperature that is the key factor here but rather which is better at transferring the heat out of the presumably warmer than ground temperature battery  uh bob why is the battery warmer than ground temperature  on the time scales in question and with the considerably reduced temperature swings several feet underground there isnt going to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what its sitting on   question  why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the  surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it  because the temperature of your hand unlike that of the battery is determined by the balance between internal heat production and external heat loss  youre feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object your hand which is kept much warmer than its surroundings  in the case of an object with no significant internal heat production this will affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings if it started out not in equilibrium with them but wont affect the final temperature  for the same reason windchill affects whether you will freeze but not whether water will freeze   svr0 resembles a highspeed collision    henry spencer  u of toronto zoology between svr0 and sunos     dick dunn    henryzootorontoedu  utzoohenry

        would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency is there any easy way to do either of these im looking for  the simplest circuit possible i guess what im asking for is some sort of color organ but not quite let me trt to explain again  look for information about 000 tone decoder chip it is an easy to use chip for detecting sound of certain frequency you need only one 000 and some other componets for each led you want to control the chip can take the voltage levels which the casette gives radio shack archer semiconductor reference guide gives good information how to use that chip it should be simplest way to go the chip costs something like 00   tomiengdahlhutfi    lowerys law thenniksulahutfi    if it jams  force it if it breaks                         it needed replacing anyway   this text is provided as is without any express or implied warranty

   this has been an interesting thread to follow and obviously this group wasnt intended as a forum for the discussion of piracy has anyone seen any estimates of the lost revenue due to pirates  i was wondering if piracy is more rampant in home or corporate computing environments  i would tend to think that business environment piracy is the major contributor to this form of lost revenue  so many companies will purchase a few copies of a software package and then employees will internally distribute them as if they owned a sitelicense  what do you guys think

  dplattntgcom dave platt writes    what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects  the affected equipment is about 000 feet from the road    might be a couple of hundred watts from the sound of it  kicking sound  out of the tv and stereo speakers by direct rf rectification requires a  mighty strong carrier  ive heard of linears so powerful that  triggering them while the car was idling would stall the engine by  pulling down the battery voltage  it would take a lot more than that it sounds like the radio equipment is actually not shut completely off  but just goes to a standby situation  i suspect that the stories are just that stories  the voltage can only be sucked down so far instantaneously when you try to jumpstart someones  car when your vehicle is at idle does your car stall no the other car just does not crank well  now the engine might stall because the idle was too low to start with when the extra current is drawn the idle speed will drop  as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the increased amperage requirement   is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company the fcc or both    ultimately its likely to be your problem to resolve im afraid  the  fcc is so understaffed that they dont pay much attention to citizen  complains about rfi or so ive heard theyll just send you a  pamphlet describing how you can apply corrective measures    talking to the power company might help  they might be able to install  filtering devices at your service panel or recommend a type which you  could have installed by a licensed electrician  a transmitter is not going to be affecting house power if surges are occurring there it is due to another cause  not a transmitter   unfortunately theres a fair chance that enough signal is being picked  up by your house wiring that a simple servicepanel filter wont  suffice  you may need to install heavyduty rfi filters at the power  connections of your affected equipment  it is probably not that much of a problem often  toroid coils on the power leads will solve that part of the interference problem it will not solve internal equipment deficiencies   if the problem occurs regularly you may need to stake out the street  in question and watch for trucks or cars with big antennae driving by  at the time interference occurs  if you can identify the vehicle which  is transmitting you may be able to contact its owner and complain  it is probably not the transmitter that is at fault if the person is an amateur then heshe will probably be willing to help  if you explain that the person is causing interference  bill  
  drandspinnerosforg douglas s rand writes       hams can legally run up to 0000 watts  it is very unlikely however     that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  ham rigs    not possible either  youd need about a 000 amp alternator for  just the amplifier  i can just see it  you need to slow  down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button  well  000 amps anyway transmissions are generally for a short interval the battery would supply the rest of course if you transmitted too much you would run the battery down  it really would not be that much of a brake  even at 00 efficiency 0000 watts would only consume 0 horsepower  bill

  brianucsdedu brian kantor writes  while its possible that its a ham radio transmitter that youre  hearing it isnt likely  every bit of signal that doesnt go out the  antenna is wasted as far as a ham is concerned and most hams are  it is the radiated signal that would cause the problem   technically competent to ensure that they dont waste any signal if they  can possibly avoid it  to get their ham license they had to pass a  government exam that tests them on that point among others    however you could be hearing a radio transmitter for sure  there are  lots of other services where the operators arent required to be  technically competent  citizens band cb for example  there is nothing in the amateur radio tests that requires an technical competence at all it is a simple matter to memorize all the questions and answers  however that said most hams that i know do spend quite a bit of time gaining some technical skill   listen to the interference  if you hear voices clearly it almost  certainly isnt ham radio and might well be cb  if you can record a  dont count on that   bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operators house  and ask him for his opinion of what youre hearing  most communities  you cannot do that legally however you can ask a ham over to listen if the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would be possible to do such scheduling  if nothing else you could invite the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes if he does then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to make it immune to rf interference   have a ham radio interference committee whose members are most willing  to help you resolve interference complaints  look in the phone book or  ask at the local ham radio store or call the fcc for contact info  the fcc may or may not have such information they have enough to do without getting calls for such information if nothing else call your city offices or police department general business number they should have the name of a local ham contact   if its a ham hes more than likely willing to help get rid of the  problem  after all it would be his signal hes wasting  if it isnt  the interference committee or the fcc may be able to suggest solutions  see above  your concept of wasted signal is erroneous if his rig is transmitting properly then the chance of interference with the exception of harmonic television interference is the greatest  since he is putting out the strongest signal   it is unfortunately the case that a transmitting station that is  operating perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a  piece of consumer audio or tv equipment just because the manufacturer of  the consumer equipment cut corners on one little section of the device  that wouldnt affect one person in a thousand but which bites you  often that can be remedied for just a few pennies by a knowledgeable  person perhaps even the person operating the transmitter youre  hearing  unfortunately most consumer equipment is succeptable  it is all poorly designed   btw hams are allowed amplifiers cb isnt  illegal ham amplifier  doesnt compute  it does but not for a mobile radio there are very few mobile rigs that could power a 0000 watt amplifier  bill

   stuff about hardware keys  if you put another computer on the port instead of the key you can hack  them by reading what happens so ive been told ive never seen this done  but i think its possible youd need some hardware knowledge and some  software to read the port  true which is why many of the newer keys ship out oh maybe 00 bits or so have the key encrypt them and return them to the pc  making a bunch of these 00 bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure things wont run without the key   anyway then this scheme at least defeats your approach  its a little costly though  personally i dont believe in copy protection and agree with the thought that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs the gains from what few pirates wont be able to copy the program  joel kolstad   
   i just bought a little gizmo that is supposed to be installed in series with the tip or ring lines of the phone wire which ones are those suppose i am holding a regular phone wire such that the little plastic tooth on the little plastic square thing with the naked lead ends that you plug into the phone is facing down and away from me which of the 0 wires that i see is the tip and which is the ring please reply to mlevinhusc0harvardedu  mike levin  mike ring is the red wire tip is the green wire of most standard phone lines they two constitute the two wires most often used for voice telephone the two live lines they are the two innermost connectors of an rj00 phone jack  another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from red to green ring to tip tipgreen being at ground potential of the voltmeter it should read 00 volts in the onhook noring position i am 00 sure its 00 v and not 00 volts doesnt hurt a phone too much if theyre reversed its just bad if one happens to somehow get grounded to earth ground elsewhere  additionally when offhook the voltage drops to about 0 to 0 volts dc i think it is supposed to correspond to a 00 to 00 ma current loop and lastly when ringing the two wires develop an ac potential of about 00 v pp at 00 to 00 hz across them where you get the electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from  hope that clears things squishendorharvardedu     
       where can i buy blinking leds besides radio shack       does anyone sell blinking leds with variable flash rate by voltage     i guess if so what hertz pulse rate are they adjustable or set to       id like blinking leds that can be set for approx 0 hz 00 hz       00 hz or 00 hz something like that im interested in whats      out there for flash rates i like the idea of leds with flasher       circuits already in them i hate soldering ics in general guess i      dont have a hell of a lot of patience          thanks           dana  if you want slow led flash rates adjustable by switches or by a 00000000 digitally controlled switch i suggest looking at a 000 oscillator chip they cost 0 at radio shack much cheaper in quantity at quality places and you will be able to find good info about simple circuits in a 000 oscialltor notebook i think forest mims has one at radio shack youll have to toy with resistorcapacitor values or you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequencies any engineer worth his salt can make a 000 osciallator its in the book and left up to you to see i hate doing ascii circuit graphics the 000 can accurately go from a few hz to about 000 khz i think  about the tape recorder gizmo you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel as a data line for flashing led and one as audio line for voice or music this would eliminate a lot of noise  the data line is probably most easily done by some kind of pll or bandpass filter using just an opamp the 000 chip is a good pll and not hard to work with however if you nothing about how a pll works i suggest you dont try this opamp information can also be found in the forest mims radio shack infobooklets and the popular 000 opamp is a snap to work with setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy so i would suggest the 000 method firstmost i have no idea what this is going into so i am really generalizing  as for manufacturing techniques if youre only goofing with it i suggest you breadboard the thing no need to solder wirewrap would be the next more permanent step and lastly solderingpcb making hope that clears things  squishendorharvardedu

        i thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post    some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries      one year i left the batteries in the garage  the garage is unheated    they were left in their places that they needed to be  one in the riding  lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle  the battery in the   riding lawnmower was about 00 years old and one of the cycle batteries   was new and one was around 0 years old  upon spring time i discovered  that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged  they all  worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced   about halfway through the summer  they had originally been stored  in the garage and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring    last year i decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts  one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete  i brought in all three and  discovered in the spring about 00 days ago that not only were the batteries  dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and   the ampmeter read around 0000000000  in other words it was pinned  the internal circut tripped and i went on to the other batteries  they  were the same       realizing that we still had 0 gigantic sailboat batteries also lead  acid i decided to put the charger on them  these had been sitting for around 0 and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only  needed a small charge around 0 hours or so on trickle  i tested them  by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they  worked fine for around 00 of em     this leads me to believe one of several things       0 i bought really tty batteries last year sorta true       0 the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the          batteries       0 there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the             room where the concrete is        0 the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air           better than concrete    btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room         any other ideas      could be the aliens anything is possible      the leadacid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction   pb  pbo0  0h0so0  0pbso0  0h00   lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water   the standard heats of formation at 00 c 00 f of the various compounds are                 heat of formation compound      at 00 c kcalmole           pb               000   pbo0            000  h0so0           00000  pbso0           0000   h00             000000   the heat of reaction at 00 c is therefore 000 kcal per mole pbso0 produced note that lead sulfate is not very soluble 00000 grams per 000 grams water at 00 c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery  i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but i may be wrong  oh well i dont have a corroded battery to corrobate and i dont feel like thinking through it right now   what is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy discharging  if moisture with dissolved electrolytes acid rain condenses on the battery a conductive path between the terminals may form  this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds the reaction is reversible if electricity from an alternator or battery charger is put back into the battery   leadacid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge  each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction  the nonreacting posts terminals of the leadacid battery are there to remove or add electric energy during a discharge or charge  because the reaction is exothermic it has a tendency to happen though quite slowly under normal circumstances  so while keeping the battery dry is a good idea it is not a total solution   to understand why leadacid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechateliers principle which can be paraphrased as  anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position  here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials

conductivity for dirt diatomaceous earth goes down with temperature  also 000 c is about 000 k and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth  the thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of 00 greater than that of dirt and is 00 times greater than wood   it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood  at any instant the discharge reaction is occurring energy is being released either as electricity or heat  thermal conductivity of air is about 0000 btuhrftftfft during storage except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery this energy is mostly released as heat  the higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface  thus if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 00 times faster than that on dirt   this is where lechateliers principle comes into play  removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion  if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced  a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface  store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have 0 surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction along   also if water evaporates from the battery that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water  this will tend to drive the discharge reaction   jeff white      jhwhit00ulkyvxlouisvilleedu   how do i get

   being in the visualization stage of a circuit design right now i was wondering what the best way to scale an ac voltage using an 0bit digital word is i am thinking of using the common method of sending the word through an adc and then comparing it with the ac voltage converted to a sawtooth wave to get a duty cycle however i am leary of this method because it a requires a lot of parts and more importantly b creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire ac line i realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference but that would require more parts and boost the price further someone mentioned to me that they had seen an ic which input 0 bits of data and directly scaled the ac voltage coming in all onchip unfortunately he couldnt remember the chip number or the manufacturer if anyone else has heard of this chip please email me i am building this project as a dimmer box for a light controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user wishes to control well each channel at least therefor if each box costs 000 i doubt that an end user will want to dish out 000 x 00  0000 for sixteen channels this is something i have noticed about todays dimmer boxes they are so expensive anyway any help which someone could offer on either a method of easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me always the preferred method  will be greatly appreciated  michael carr mcarronuedu

  there is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlettpackard  older original deskjet and possibly deskjet 000 units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side viewed from front of the printer  newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide  the black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out  there was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation  hp placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism  i did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer  i dont have the information handy  i suggest contacting your nearest hp service center for information on obtaining the kit  hp has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade  i upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 000  the kit was fairly expensive  you are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 000 now that prices have declined so much  upgrading an original deskjet to 000 requires a fair amount of skill but no soldering  upgrading a deskjet plus to a 000 is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts  contact your hp service center for further information  the pcl language used by deskjets is considerably different from the pcl used by laser printers especially the newer laser printers  the biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line  this makes no material difference for lasers but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster  as you might guess the result is hideously slow printing  the new dos wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior  from the way wordperfect works this would not be easy to change  windows wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the dos drivers instead of windows  the pcl0 dialect used in the laserjet iiip allows compression that permits a full page 000 dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory  an uncompressed image could be as large as about 000 kbytes but the printer needs about 000k of memory for its internal housekeeping  laserjet iv models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations  deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts  a single page from a laserjet only requires about 00 seconds  this is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer  the presumption of course being that the laser printer has completed its warmup cyle  until ink chemistry is changed wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable  i wont use the word impossible but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely chosing an appropriate paper type helps but does not eliminate the problem  laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components  hp does accept return of spent toner cartridges mitigating the material waste problem to a degree  energy waste could use more work  warmup times have decreased allowing standby current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet iv  kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system  the image drum is good for approximately 000k copies  it is a very nice print engine  i wish hp used the kyocera engine  kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system  the recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of hps laser printers  the pickup pressure rollers are subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out  the usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper the paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from hp service  replacement cost for the transport is almost 000  the feed rollers are not separately replacable though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician i have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer  it depends upon the application which printer is best for you  if you only print 0 or 00 pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output the deskjet is a very good choice  as noted the deskjet 000 is my choice for personal use     bill mayhew      neoucom computer services department rootstown oh  000000000  usa    phone 0000000000 wtmuhuraneoucomedu 00000000    000000 n0wed

  what are peoples opinions about laser detectors  escort makes a laser detector the passport 0000 and claims it works fine  however ive talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you are lucky  ie if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in front of you and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your detector  otherwise it wont work  regular radar of course travels in all directions hence it is more detectable  any comments  escort has a deal till the end of april i think where if you buy their wideband passport 0000  x k ka and laser detectors youll save 00 off of buying them separately  in this case the addition of the laser detector over the passport 0000 is only 00 ie passport 0000 normally costs 000  eddie gornish university of illinois  center for supercomputing research  development  gornishcsrduiucedu

  kuusamakaarnecstutfi kuusama juhavtt writes  not that the question is anything important but i am still curious why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green i have seen a few blue ones but no red yellow company logo etc is there a technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have not tought about it yet  the green layer is a soldermask and is used to make a finished board look neat and to avoid solder bridges especially when using wave soldering or any other mechanized approach ive seen red mask but most that ive seen are green  a bakelite board will look brown in colour and if the solder mask is put on looks like a brown board with green paint on either side or just one side of the board a fibreglass board will look green from the side because the green soldermask makes the board appear that colour if you got a fibreglass board with no mask it would be a whitishgrey colour teflon boards do exist as well but im not sure about that one  id guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green so theyre not about to change also any change in any chemical probably requires a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards a lot of companies do not make their own boards they ship them to a real boardhouse

   why are circuit boards green  the material used to make them goes by two names  if it is used to make circuit boards it is called fr0  the same material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a structural material and is called g00  fr0 and g00 are both green  they are not green because of a solder masking agent  the basic ingredients are a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers  i am not sure what the specs are on the resin but if you are really curious you can call nema national electronics manufacturing association or ciba geigy a major manufacturer of epoxy resins to find out  as an aside i occasionally mix clear epoxy and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments the proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in g00  they are the same green color

  the leadacid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction   pb  pbo0  0h0so0  0pbso0  0h00   lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water heats of formation deleted the heat of reaction at 00 c is therefore 000 kcal per mole pbso0 produced note that lead sulfate is not very soluble 00000 grams per 000 grams water at 00 c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery  i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but i may be wrong  oh well i dont have a corroded battery to corrobate and i dont feel like thinking through it right now  the major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an acid solution pbso0 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out  also h0so0 is in a water solution as 0h00 and so0  thus the heats of formation of pbso0 and h0so0 are for the most part irrelevant  what is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy discharging  as it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic heat producing more about this later  what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this were talking leadacid batteries of course the battery slowly self discharges  as this discharge takes place two things happen the level of pb ions in the acid solution increases ie the lead            and lead oxide plates are dissolved         the level of h00 ions in the acid solution decreases ie the solution            becomes less acidic or more like water if you like now as the post to which i am responding correctly stated pbso0 will precipitate in a water nonacid solution  when the battery dies ie is fully discharged we end up with a high concentration of pb and so0 in water  so pbso0 forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery of course this happens in varying degrees the more discharged the more precipitate forms  the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery  if there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate more common in a newer battery a dead short results  i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition but they are for the most part useless  they can dissolve the pbso0 but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly  you may have some success with these products for a newer battery  stuff deleted to understand why leadacid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechateliers principle which can be paraphrased as  anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position  here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials stuff deleted this is where lechateliers principle comes into play  removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion  if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced  a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface  store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have 0 surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction along  this stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid in fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures  a logical consequence of the above argument is this if you really want your car to start lower the battery temperature to  00 to pull the reaction along  we all know from experience at  least those of us in canada do it gets cold up here that this is not true  if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery  besides which there is not enough energy released through self discharge  to appreciably raise the temperature  the air would amply dissipate any  such heat whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not  this  is of course irrelevant since you would want the battery to be cool  during storage  just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged

   what are peoples opinions about laser detectors  escort makes a  laser detector the passport 0000 and claims it works fine  however  ive talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you  are lucky  ie if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in  front of you and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your  detector  otherwise it wont work  regular radar of course travels  in all directions hence it is more detectable  any comments    escort has a deal till the end of april i think where if you buy  their wideband passport 0000  x k ka and laser detectors youll  save 00 off of buying them separately  in this case the addition of  the laser detector over the passport 0000 is only 00 ie passport  0000 normally costs 000  uniden makes an all in one unit x k ka laser for about 000 colorado radar sells passive radar jammers the passive supposedly being legal for about 000 wont help you with laser however  scott

  i wrote    bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operators house   and ask him for his opinion of what youre hearing  most communities    you cannot do that legally however you can ask a ham over to listen  if the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would  be possible to do such scheduling  if nothing else you could invite  the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes  if he does then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to  make it immune to rf interference  as a coupld of people have pointed out  this is wrong it is not illegal to record or disclose what you heard on the ham bands   bill

  has anyone got an active filter design program that runs on an ibm pc   something that will easily let me specify bandpass filter parameters and it will give me the appropriate component values   it has to be public domain  if anyone has one could you mail it to me  thanks in advance  scott u0000000wraithcsuoweduau  ps it can run under windows if necessary    
     the color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of it    original and older boards were bakelite composition and were brown  phenolic spelling was a tan  most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green  filled fiberglass is blue  teflon is white    rubbish the reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is used older boards bakelite and phenolic rarely used a solder mask these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques and hence are the colour of the compound used to make them these days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during soldering and also to prevent the decomposition of traces under harsh environments the light and dark green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them usually applied as a complete film photographically produced the blue and red or orange boards are a twopart epoxy or a liquidimageable resist formulation and are applied in a different manner theres a lot of info about the pros and cons of each but thats another story      slan go foill                     risky b  geoff swan research  development            swaneemegacomau megadata pty ltd                             000 waterloo rd north ryde                       00 0 000 0000 nsw 0000 australia                       v          fax 00 0 000 0000

   on benzene and acetone not only is benzene a carcinogen it is adsorbed through the skin and cause cumulative damage to the bone marrow which is essential to the production of your blood cells  it is highly toxic one exposure is unlikely to kill you but it will likely do hidden damage  benzene is one compound that chemists try like hell to avoid using acetone is much less toxic but is highly flammable and volatile  it also dissolves lots of things so handle with great care   jonathan g harris department of chemical engineering  mit rm 00000  00 ames street cambridge ma 00000 harrisathenamitedu 0000000000  fax 0000000

  acetone will likely damage the carpet first solvent to try is denatured alcohol do not waste your time with rubbing alcohol you can use methyl alcohol instead of denatured alcohol if you want to have a cocktail while you are removing the goo use pure grain alcohol  if the alcohol does not work try carbon tetrachloride if neither of these work you may need to try a stronger solvent but the alcohol works for most adhesives good luck  jim

  i know this is a long shot but does anyone know what solvent i should  use to clean ducttape adhesive from carpet  yet another suggestion but this one is nontoxic although i would handle it like any other cleaner and it smells nice  the chemical is called dlimonene and it smells like lemon peels i think it is a lemon extract of some kind  you might find it in a hardware store sold as a generalpurpose solvent but your best bet would be any bike store  it is used as a chaincleaning fluid  it works on sticker glue crayons grease oil etc  its clear yellow in the bottle and you can use it straight if you add water it changes to a creamy consistency which is good for some jobs  peter

  the 000cd is one of three oscillators that hp made many years ago  the others were the low frequency oscillator and the wide range  oscillator these are the ones with the 0 diameter chrome dial a wein bridge circuit that used pilot lights as the feedback loop and firebottles that produced many volts of output  ive just acquired a pair of these venerable old beasts  the nonworking one sn 000 owned by crosley radio at one point needs help i know i can likely buy a microfiche copy of the book  from hp but that costs and considering i paid a dollar for the pair in the rain at the dayton hamvention  does anyone have such a book they could copy parts of for me thank you

  just a quick question  what standard lab solvents can be used to clean electronic equipment and components safely ie not corrode dissolve shortout etc the equipment water methanol ccl0  you dont say what kind of electronic equipment you mean  its hard to give a generic answer  there is essentially no solvent that wont do things like washing lubricant out of switches  when weve needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things weve just used distilled water  the key thing to remember is to make sure the gear is completely dry before powering it up again  we let it dry for several days to be damn sure  i doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water  i would be very wary of ccl0 not least because it is dangerous to you even if its not going to harm the equipment  not only is it poisonous but i believe its now known to be carcinogenic   svr0 resembles a highspeed collision    henry spencer  u of toronto zoology between svr0 and sunos     dick dunn    henryzootorontoedu  utzoohenry

    i am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular american phone  on your home system i vaguely remember a few years ago when deutsche  bundespost split into postdienst postbank and telekom there was some  discussion about a new regulation i know that cordless or cellular phones  still have to be approved by the telekom but does that hold true for regular  phones in my areacode in germany 0000  frechen near koeln you can use  yes it does all the equipment has to have that telekom approval number to be legal what has changed is that you can buy the equipment somewhere else im pretty sure the same holds true in sweden at least when i read some information on it about tweo years ago and btw i do know that most of the lines in sweden can handle tonedialing just dont be sure that all can    wolfgang diestelkamp wdcstuberlinde wolfgangfirstgmdde

   ive bothered the rental shops and audio shops about the problem but most of them have precious little experience in dealing with generated power  my suspicion is that i dont really need anything larger than 0kw and this could all be resolved with a transformer of some sort  nope  your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the long cable from the generator or just plain not having enough power  i would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short peaks  you can try using larger and shorter cables to the generator or try strapping the amps for 000v service and running 000v mains cables out which will minimize the line drop  if these dont work though youre going to need a bigger generator  i assume that youre using wellmaintained generators and have watched the voltage output on the generator properly  if you dont have 000v coming out of the unloaded generator youll never get 000v at the other end  can anyone offer any advice  i want to do a lot of outdoor events this summer and it would be nice if this power problem could be resolved easily ive been looking into buying a powerpack so i could tap into junction boxes directly but have no idea where to start  one that would resolve my generator problems as well would be of high value to me  i recommend you talk with an electrician who has experience in this sort of work and not with the proaudio people  also i recommend that you dont try to tap into junction boxes at all but hire a licensed electrician if you dont really know what you are doing  ive had to clean up after two people who nearly killed themselves playing in hot 000a boxes and it wasnt much fun scott  
   basically i am looking for something to operate in the ranges of accelerations found in an automobile environment i would like the device to operate as a trigger for other systems when the cars deceleration reaches a threshold value which is how i assume some seat belt lock mechanisms and air bag deployment systems work  open up one of the airbag control boxes  they have inexpensive piezoelectric accelerometers in them  i know that the gm cars use the setra units  the cheapest way to get such an accelerometer is to cannibalize an existing automotive unit  incidentally these things arent very linear but for the application they would do a fine job scott  
   while i have gotten 00 years out of this digital receiver it has been acting verry strange of late  i hope that  the following symptoms may help someone diagnose the error   i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had  has long died thus if i unplug it  it wont remember the presets   it has given up listening to the remote  i tried changing the remotes batteries when i try a remote function  the receiver registers that it received it a green remote light flashes but the right function doesnt happen  if any function at all  also strange when i hit  the mute button for example the display panel goes black  yikes ive never seen that before    before all the strangeness started the system turned itself off and on again  by itself   sometimes it wont play a radio station so i have to kinda twist it  yes kinda flex the motherboard chasis for it to get the radio tuning back  the aux in function always works however  it is inconvenient but not inconvenient enough to pay an  expensive repair fee  while im not a hardware guy i wonder  if something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix the strange thing is that these symptoms come and go   someone told me this unit series has a bad voltage amp chip  anyway  arghh cjk

  thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and i am looking at using a couple of the ideas i recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil spec version of exars xr0000 timercounter chip it is stable down to 00 c and sucks very little power they show an application for a ultralong time delay up to several years depending on the rc time constant in this application they have two of them cascaded together the reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled in this configuration the output is high when the system is reset when triggered the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 00000 x the timing cycle of the first chip the total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from to  000 x r x c to 00000 x r x c in 000 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output the beauty of it is the timebase chip would only have to have a 000uf timing cap and a 000k resistor for 000 seconds per timing cycle so i can get a maximum of 00000000 seconds between timing cycles 000 x 00000 or about 00 days  of course thats much more than i need 00 days but the counter allows for 000 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the pellet puker after the first 00 days and it trips it would reset its self for the next 00 day timing cycle and so forth  power is still a problem though a few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow as an insulator and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack i like that idea  this thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 00 volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow anyway i ordered the xr0000s to see what i can do with them should be interesting as long as im not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of antartica freezing my buns off   thanks again everyone   wes

   i have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design  what i am looking for is a stable ultralong solid state timer what they want  to do is to place this thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount  of snow fall over a period of six weeks every two weeks they want to trip a  selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the  snow then by digging down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measured  as they come to the different color pellets    the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold 00 degrees  and a power source that wouldnt drain i have looked at the xr0000 timers and  the standard ne000 dual timers but thier temp specs wont go that low also  two weeks equates to 0000000 seconds per firing which means one big timing  cap  i have found 00 farad yes farad  caps that have a working voltage of  0 volts and are small in size but again the time of discharge at 00 or lower  degrees isnt linear i was thinking of using several timers chained together   to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period but that blasted cold and  the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain one possibility would be to  use solar panels but this is during the six month twilight anyone have any  good ideas     thanks in advance     wes   firstly i would never consider trying to make a oneshot timer your 0f0 cap will have been designed as a ram battery substitute rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current their performance in some respects is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap the other point is that big electros are usually rated with 000 tolerances so calculating exactly what capacitance you have particularly when considering the cold  you should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain that rolls over from zero to maximum count or viceversa once every 0000000 seconds if you were to use something like a 000hz clock you would need a divider chain of 000 to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period of course you could trim the 000hz oscillator to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at 00 is low anyway  i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit  caveat  im not experienced in low temperature electronics so i cant guarantee that this or any other approach is the best for inhospitable conditions  johnh                                         electronics department                            school of mpce                macquarie university                                                   sydney australia 0000      email johnhmpcemqeduau ph 00 0 000 0000 fax 00 0 000 0000

  hi     ive just built a valve preamp and use a diodecapacitor voltage multiplier to step the 00vac supply voltage up to approx  000vdv as the load resistance increases the rc constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops i need as high an output voltage as possible about 000v   the circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages ie 00 diodes and 00 capacitors each capacitor develops about 00v across them and i take the output from across seven capacitors000v   each capacitor is 000mfd at 00v  if i increase each of the capacitors rating 000000mfd that will increase the rc constant and hence alleviate some of the problem these capacitors are going to be a little expensive as i need 00 of them so  0 what would happen if i connected a 000mfd at 000v capacitor in parallel  with the output and hence in parallel with the seven 000mfd capacitors   will it as i assume increase the c in circuit and hence increase the rc time constant if it does and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this then i will have killed two birds with one stone as i am experiencing some 00hz ripple and hence amp hum and this new capacitor will smooth this out  and 0 can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor choke to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 00hz mains hum lowest resistance possible     ive not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is too much of a distraction im at university and ive got to get my  dissertation finished in two weeks  hence im mailing not playing with my solderoing iron itll be cheaper too in the long run especially if 00 new large capacitors dont work as planned  email please cant always read the net  thanks in advance   chris        name  mr chris smith            twang on that ole guitar           addrs scst00ukaclivcsc                                           uni   liverpool university quest to build more and more hardware    dgree computer science                                                  what ever the sun may be it is certainly not a ball of flaming gas    dh lawrence    all views expressed are my own and reflect that of private thought

    telephone systems have the capability of a passband of 00hz to 0khz  the reason they do not implement this is it is not backward compatable  to every telephone system  in addition the most effecent mix of   electrical effecency and intelegability closly mateches a 000hz0khz  passband  close but no banana to paraphrase garfield the reason 0000000 hz is used is that voice channels used to occupy 0khz bands when multiplexed on a trunk line therefore 000hz at the bottom and 000hz at the top of this band were filtered to minimise interference with the next band  nowadays digital trunks have made this less relevant but the phone companies still see no reason to improve quality especially for free therefore digital chunk of a trunk segments still have a guaranteed bandwidth of only 0khz so they can carry the equivalent of one analog line at the clock rate of a standard pcm t0 or e0 digital trunk  its all historical   here in the uk the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to  local lines ie those used by the average domestic client private lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are  usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital  dont quote me on that but i think i remember a bt engineer  saying something to that effect when i was doing some work shadowing a few years ago  byeeeee    chris        name  mr chris smith            twang on that ole guitar           addrs scst00ukaclivcsc                                           uni   liverpool university quest to build more and more hardware    dgree computer science                                                  what ever the sun may be it is certainly not a ball of flaming gas    dh lawrence    all views expressed are my own and reflect that of private thought

   i was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when i came across a range of peltier effect heat pumps intended for cooling components  for those who have not heard of this effect you put a current through one of these devices and it pumps heat from one side to the other  reverse the current and you reverse the effect  i think a temperature difference can give you an emf as well  anyway it struck me that you could make a nice coolhot box for picnics with one of these a power regulator a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks  the biggest device can shift 00w with an efficiency of 0000 which aint bad although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour  unfortunately the catalogue didnt list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump  i imagine that you would get a backemf as the temperature gradient across the device increases  if so presumably its power decreases as the backemf increases until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed assuming no leakage  if so then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more although that would be a lousy way to control it  what i would like to know is  0 are the above guesses correct  0 what is the opencircuit thermal resistance of a typical device    i just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when i unplug it  0 how does a peltier effect heat pump actually work  it looks like    magic  0 why dont they use these things in domestic fridgesfreezers   thanks in advance  paul  paul johnson pajgecmrccouk     tel 00 000 00000 ext 0000  these ideas and others like them can be had  gecmarconi research is not for 000 each from any reputable idealist  responsible for my opinions

   i was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when i came across a range of peltier effect heat pumps intended for cooling components  for those who have not heard of this effect you put a current through one of these devices and it pumps heat from one side to the other  reverse the current and you reverse the effect  i think a temperature difference can give you an emf as well  anyway it struck me that you could make a nice coolhot box for picnics with one of these a power regulator a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks  the biggest device can shift 00w with an efficiency of 0000 which aint bad although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour   socalled coolhot boxes have been advetised for several years  i recall damark advertising them in a recent catalog  problem with the units is they do a shy job of keeping food coldwarm  the peliter devices used just dont seem to have enough punch to keep up  if you want something hot you need to heat it up before you put it in the box and end up hours later with food thats only moderately warm  same goes for cold items  unfortunately the catalogue didnt list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump  i imagine that you would get a backemf as the temperature gradient across the device increases  if so presumably its power decreases as the backemf increases until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed assuming no leakage  if so then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more although that would be a lousy way to control it  what i would like to know is  0 are the above guesses correct  0 what is the opencircuit thermal resistance of a typical device    i just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when i unplug it   youde probably be better off getting a good colemantm cooler and stocking up on blue ice blocks   0 how does a peltier effect heat pump actually work  it looks like    magic  0 why dont they use these things in domestic fridgesfreezers   same as above  not enough punch in them to keepget things coldhot  thanks in advance  paul  paul johnson pajgecmrccouk     tel 00 000 00000 ext 0000  these ideas and others like them can be had  gecmarconi research is not for 000 each from any reputable idealist  responsible for my opinions mike behnke              senior techadvisor  quid est illuidin aqua fermi nat accel lab      equipment suuport    batavia il             computing div        pistrix  pistrix behnkefnalffnalgov                          my opinions are my own not of the lab so if you dont like them call  0000uwhiner

    i would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which is output from a thermocouple preferably by a factor of 000 or 0000  so that the resulting voltage can be fed more easily into a personalcomputerbased adc data acquisition card  might anyone be able to point me to references to such circuits  i have seen simple amplifier circuits before but i am not sure how well they work in practice  in this case id like something which will amplify sufficiently nicely to be used for thermocouples say a few degrees accuracy or better  any pointers would be greatly appreciated

  heres a question for all you electrical engineers out there    i bought an infrared detector module at radio shack for 000  it is a  little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal then i hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared led the circuit works like a minature remote control extender in my car  all remote commands are relayed to the cd player hidden in the glove compartment it works fine with my denon cd player but when i tried to build the same circuit for a friends vcr it didnt work   the circuit appears to work for other remotes you can see infrared with a sony ccd camcorder but coincidentally it only seems to work for my cd player  any advice would be appreciated         brian   ubsiler  msuvx0memstedu   
   i agree  i come at this from nuclear physics where one often discusses  particlehole excitations and certain reactions have the effect of  applying an annihilation operator and creating a hole and it is a  subtle question  the longer one works with them the more real they  become  there are also quasiparticles which raise the same sort  of question about how real the entity is  the phenomenon is most  certainly a real one   ok ive asked this before and with a new thread on these lines i ask this again  0 if a large hole current is run thru a resistor will there be    i0  r cooling instead of heating  0 can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies    hole currents over normal electron currents  0 what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of    hole mobility to electron mobility please quote actual    test samples rather than estimates based on theory also    dont be limited to semiconductors consider also insulators    resistors dielectrics piezoelectrics conductors    magnets metal ceramic magnetostrictives etc  notes     to summarize this thread has so far stated that the only area    where holes are not detectable is the vacuum that is hole    particles only exist in the presence of matter    previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain    semiconductors the question that naturally arises is if    the hole currents inside a semiconductor vanish at the point    where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor say copper    i dont want a theoretical discussion here about whether    holes could exist inside metal conductors rather i ask for    an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such    currents if they exist    also note that i have crossposted this to scielectronics    since this is now becoming an electronic discussion  thanx eric    et   a force of nature

   as for adcoms mobil they are going with amps that canb use balanced inputs a very nice toy but im afraid its goig to push their amps beyound resonable price ranges  especialy because taking advantage of those balanced inputs requires a 000 rca to balanced adapter  umm when i was doing sound reinforcement for a living i used to get direct boxes which convert unbalanced 00 jacks to balanced xlrs for about 00 each or a little more for higher quality youll need two for a stereo signal of course and a little adapter thingy from  radio sht to convert from rca to 00 total cost should be around 00 you can also buy transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself total cost there should be under 00 you can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear the benefit no noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component with the balanced inputs even when you run them in bad places like next to power lines   john bell nasa langley research center bellhopslarcnasagov

   i have a new scope and i thought id save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in after having it awhile i noticed two things about the function generator for one there seems to be a bias even when the pulloffset is pushed in that is i have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 00mv bias the other really annoying thing is that the damn output wont go below about 0v pp i am a student  you may have guessed from my previous posts  and i often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits i buildmany of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 000mv amplitude and most have input impedances in the 00s of kohm range the thing is in order to use my function generator i have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable then of course to measurethe input impedance of my circuit i am going to have to throw in another resistor in series with the 00ohm output of the generator i could just ignore it but now with this little divider there i have to figure that in its kind of a pain in  the ass is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem the box would tkae the function generator input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low unchanging number i would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so i could just build a little buffer amp but id like to have this box not be active any quick ideas the scopes not broken for other reasons i had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it the function generator was the same way on that one too  please help as i am feeling very stupid  today  dave  dgj0yvirginiaedu

  just a shot here but ya never know  i once bought a real cheap equalizer  power amp for my car tape player  at one of those motelroom truckload sales and it sounded great  for a  while that is  then one channel quit entirely  i opened it up and the  amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder  joints attaching it to the pcb  i soldered them back and it worked fine   i just had to keep the volume a bit lower than i did before  probably  lousy heat sinking  you said a nice alpine which im sure is a few orders of mag higher in quality than the pos i had  but the point is  look inside before you scrap it since you occasionally find something you can repair maybe even the same thing i found  good luck  
  im no expert at upss but you said something that made it sound like you didnt realize something  on a typical ups well on ours anyway there is no switchover from ac to dc  all the protected equipment is always running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual  condition of also having them on charge  if the power fails big deal   the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but  theres something like 00 carsized batteries in that cabinet so it  takes a while  if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter why not do it all the time  then thered be no switchover to screw things up and no having to sense the failure fast  just keep the dc on charge when the power is on and itll be there in zero time when you need it  just some ideas  cant guarantee whatll work or not but hope at least some of this helped

   i have a new scope and i thought id save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in  hmm now where was that ad for the combination radiohand cranked generatorflashlightsiren i saw   function generator has a 00mv offset and the amplitudes too high  is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem the box would tkae the function generator input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low unchanging number i would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so i could just build a little buffer amp but id like to have this box not be active  sure youve already got the right idea  ignoring the 00 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second just run it into say a voltage divider made of 000 ohms in series with 00 ohms  this new circuit is the thevenin equivalent of one that puts out 0000 of the original voltage and has an output impedence of negligibly less than 00 ohms  you may want to monkey with the values a little depending on whether you care more about the exact dividing ratio or the availability of parts  hows that sound  joel kolstad  ps  this is why those 00000 high voltage probes for multimeters can be accurate but still cheap  they have something like 000 megs in series with 000k which doesnt load the often high impedence source much as well as keeping the probably 00 meg impedance multimeter happy

  mdonahueamiganetchiilus mike donahue writes   i do not know much about adcom mobil audio products but i do know for a fact that adcom does not make its own high end home audio equptment and that 00 of it comes directly out of tiawan  like most highvolume manufacturers adcom has most of its pc boards assembled offshore in their case mostly in the far east  final assembly and testing are done in east brunswick  the products are and have always been designed entirely in the us by their own staff and by audiophile gurus like walter jung  adcom also tends to prefer american and european components over their japanesefar east equivalents  offshore assembly is one reason that adcom is able to make products that perform as well as those from people like audio research and van alstine and better than hafler and forte but at a much lower cost  of course if your musical diet consists mostly of rock you might prefer components from kenwood or pioneer  roger williams most great discoveries are made rogerwworldstdcom  by accident the larger the consulting engineer  funding the longer it takes to middleborough mass  have that accident  
    just a thought of mine here   since an onhook line is aprox 0000v and offhook it usually drops below 0   how about an led in series with a zener say around 00v   onhook  led on   offhook  led off   would this work if anyone triestried it please let me know     aye theres the rub  if you draw enough current to light an led the   equipment at the phone company will think youve gone off hook   in the onhook state youre not supposed to draw current    which means you should just use your digital voltmeter you can use an  old vom but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think  theres something wrong with the cable      look guys whats the problem here  if you want a light that goes on when   the phone is off hook all you need it to run it in series with the   line as i mentioned in my previous post  if you want a light that goes on   when the phone is on hook all you need is a voltage threshold detector  if youre going to do the series diode thing which is the easiest just make sure that the led can take the current i cant recall it offhand but its something like 000ma or more  careful now folks also consider the 00vac 00hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phones supposed to ring  even with a simple zener and led setup you might end up with some carbon real quick  whatever scheme you use make sure youve got at least 000vrated components on  the frontend  also remember that if im not mistaken the phone line is a 000ohm equivalent circuit  any current you draw from the 00v or so gets dropped across that 000ohms  thats fine until youre down to roughly 00v when ma bell considers it to be offhook  but dropping it that far down is probably a big nono  the easiest implementation to accomplish the above      tip                 rectifier  resistor                           diode                                                               v                                     zener            resistor                                                                                                                                          v   led                                                                                                ring   this is only a suggestiongo ahead and blow holes in it but you get the idea  choose a highefficiency led so you dont need much current to get it to light up  choose values for the other components as required  aaron   
  im no expert at upss but you said something that made it sound like you didnt realize something  on a typical ups well on ours anyway there is no switchover from ac to dc  all the protected equipment is always running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual  condition of also having them on charge  if the power fails big deal   the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but  theres something like 00 carsized batteries in that cabinet so it  takes a while  if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter why not do it all the time  then thered be no switchover to screw things up and no having to sense the failure fast  just keep the dc on charge when the power is on and itll be there in zero time when you need it   actually its a bit more complicated than thati sounds to me your ups takes in ac rectifies it to dc to charge the batteries and then takes the battery dc and chops it to ac again feeding your equipment  this approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since as you mentioned nothing will know about what happened down the line  another way to do the ups scheme is to use the mains until you lose power and then kick in the battery backup with its inverter to replace the lost power  the problem here is the switchover time and youve got to resync the ac in no time flat  unfortunately most everything is built around the assumption that ac is available so the ups guys have to provide and ac output to be usableya sorta have to make it work with what there already  similar story with our telephone system  it was first invented back in the 0000s  were still using the same damn system media as they did back then  if i have a phone from back then i can assure you itll work on todays phone system  it costs too much to overhaul everyone to a new system so they make it work with what is out there    
  i had a ge emerson 00 color tv for about 0 years and one fine day while we were watching something i doubt if the program was the cause we heard a mild explosion   our screen went blank but there was sound so we thought oh we have special effects on the program  but soon the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the tv the brilliant ees we are we unplugged the tv and called customer service only to be thrown around by please hold i will transfer u to blah blah   finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the tv and got a new one we wanted a bigger one too  after all the story what i wanted to know is is my problem an isolated incident or a common one i recall reading about russian tvs exploding but not here in the us why would the picture tube explode or even smoke  i still have the left over tv set i might dig into it this summer any idea where i can get parts for these things probably will cost more than tv   heh heh heh hehi laugh because i have the same damn tv and it did the same thing  actually it is a goldstar but its essentially the same tv and electronicsjust a different face plate and name  0  fortunately tv tubes dont explode  id think the tv mfrs want to make this possibility remote as possible  if at all theyll  implode and the glass that blows out would be the result of the glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion in any case dont kick it around    0  i fixed the tv after getting a hold of some schematics  it turned out to be a blown 0w resistor feeding the flyback transformer  i guess the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it created burning itself out  i checked to make sure the flyback wasnt shorted or anything first  oh luckily i had a resistor handy lying around that had just the right value for what i needed  i cant see it being more than 00 cents  well needless to say the tv still works today  so go get a set of schematics and have some funjust dont get shocked poking around the flyback   
   i would like to digitize the output of a squid magnetometer range 00 v to 00 v and do digital signal processing in a computer say a macintosh ii or a 000 pc  i would like a good 00 bit adc with good linearity and a high conversion speed at least 00 khz preferably 000 khz  other concerns  0  must i use an adc external to my computer to avoid digital noise      feedback into my sensitive squid electronics  might be a good idea  the resolution you requested is about 00mv in order to get what youve paid for noise level better be lower than that  it is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a pc  before you pay  for a pc card test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave i think there is a sine wave on a cd  digital domain   there are possibly other low thd sources  run the digitized waveform through a fft transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum  thats should give you a good indication of the design thats what i am doing to test a data acquistion system i have designed  i got the idea from maxim data sheet  if you can live with 00 bit resolution i would recommend looking at the max000 from maxim  it is a high speed 000khz complete sampling ad with dsp interface  the input range is  0v and it uses a serial interface which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source  the analog design guide i got from them shows a 000db noise level  they claim a 00db max 00 typ thd  looks pretty good for the 00  0000 pieces  a evaluation kit is available  might want to give these nice folks a call  00000000000 or fax 0000000000 and 000 0000000 ext0000 for application assistance  this assumes that you can build your own das and write your own software hey you can get the max000 as a free sample just by calling the 0000   i would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a mac or pc based adc system  i would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level otherwise you might be throwing out your money  charles cunningham cecimagerllnlgov  k c lee elec eng grad student  i have no connection with maxim except i do in general recommend companies that give samples to students to others  i feel they deserve that for being nice to me

   im considering modernizing some old wiring in my home and  i need a little advice on outlet wiring  several outlets  are the old two prong type without the ground  naturally  the wire feeding these outlets is 000 without the ground  wire  i noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the  000 with ground and that on these circuits the ground  wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral white wire    so  heres my question  it seems to me that id have the  same electrical circuit if i hooked the jumper from the neutral  over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets  whats wrong with my reasoning here    no  no  nooo  the ground green wire is for safety  no current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions  this means that theres normally no voltage drop in it either  it is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire even if youre grounded in some other way at the same time    the neutral white wire is as dave vanderbyl correctly said the return for the hot wire  since current flows in it theres a voltage drop  if you plug a heavy load into a properlywired grounded outlet you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground    they are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel but nowhere repeat nowhere else  well almost  there are strange exceptions for things like subpanels  what you can do if you want threeprong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a gfci outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper  in fact depending on where you are putting your new outlets a gfci may be required  there is a faq on electrical wiring posted regularly to recwoodworking and newsanswers  it goes into great detail on these issues including gfcis and you should probably read it before asking any more questions  ill mail a copy to you append a copy here and will ask the writers to crosspost it here in the future    jamie hanrahan kernel mode systems san diego ca internet  jehcmkrnlcom  uucp uunetcmkrnljeh  cis 000000000

wiring where do i buy stuff    although weve done a fair bit of wiring we are not electricians and we cannot be responsible for what you do  if youre at all uncertain about what is correct or safe dont do it  contact someone qualified  a licensed electrician or your local electrical inspector  electricity is no joke mistakes can result in shocks fires or electrocution  furthermore our discussion is based on the us national electrical code nec and the canadian electrical code cec to the best of our abilities we have confirmed every detail with the electrical code but we dont quote sections simply to keep this thing readable  if you think were wrong we invite you to correct us but please  quote references  the nec and the cec do not in and of themselves have the force of law  many municipalities adopt it en toto  others however do not  check your with your local building department and provincial hydro inspection offices in canada to find out what applies in your area  also your local electrical utility may also have special requirements for electrical service installation  bear in mind too that we say here applies primarily to ordinary singlefamily residences  multifamily dwellings mobile homes commercial establishments etc are sometimes governed by different rules  also note that contrary to popular belief in the us and in some parts of canada canada is not a whollyowned subsidiary of the us  consequently the nec does not apply in canada lots of things are the same including voltages line frequencies and the laws of physics  but there are a number of crucial differences in the regulations  where we can weve noted them flagging the relevant passages with nec or cec  remember that the cec and nec are minimal standards  it is often smart to go beyond their minimal requirements   the nec is a model electrical code devised and published by the national fire protection association an insurance industry group its revised every three years  the 0000 version has been released you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by calling them directly at 0000000000  the code exists in several versions  theres the full text which is fairly incomprehensible  theres an abridged edition which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses and theres the nec handbook which contains the authorized commentary on the code as well as the full text  thats the recommended version  unfortunately theres no handbook for the abridged edition  and the full handbook is expensive  us00 plus shipping and handling   the canadian standards association is an organization made up of various government agencies power utilities insurance companies electrical manufacturers and other organizations the csa publishes csa standard c000 which is updated every two or three years  each province adopts with some amendments this standard and publishes a provincespecific code book since each province publishes its own slightly modified standard it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the csa standard itself  in this faq cec really means the appropriate provincial standard  in particular this faq is derived from the ontario hydro electrical safety code 00th edition 0000  which is in turn based on csa c0000000 00th edition  while differences exist between the provinces an attempt has been made to avoid specifictoontario detail  the appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical inspection offices of your provincial power authority  in ontario its ontario hydro  the ontario hydro book isnt overly fat  its about c00 and includes mailed updates  i hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the equivalent nec publications  dont bother asking in quebec  diy wiring is banned throughout the province   in most places homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring in some theyre not  check with your local electrical inspector  most places wont permit you to do wiring on others homes for money without a license  nor are you permitted to do wiring in commercial buildings  multiple dwellings eg duplexes are usually considered semicommercial or commercial  however many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semicommercial wiring if youre supervised by a licensed electrician  if you can find one willing to supervise  if you do your own wiring an important point  do it neat and well  what you really want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do  after all its your own home and its you or your family that might get killed if you make a mistake  an electrician has time pressures has the skills and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast safe job in this faq weve consciously given a few recommendations that are in excess of code because we feel that its reasonable and will impress the inspector  the inspector will know that youre an amateur  you have to earn his trust  the best way of doing this is to spend your time doing as neat a job as possible  dont cut corners exceed specifications  otherwise the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions  dont try to hide anything from the inspector  use the proper tools  ie dont use a bread knife to strip wires or twist wires with your fingers  the inspector wont like it and the results wont be that safe  and it takes longer  and youre more likely to stick a hunk of 00ga wire through your hand that way  dont handle house wire when its very cold eg below 00c or 00f  thermoplastic house wire particularly older types become very brittle   first theres the obvious  a hammer a drill a few screwdrivers both straight and phillipshead  if youre  lucky enough to live in canada or find a source of csaapproved devices you need robertson square recess screwdrivers 0 and 0 instead of phillips  for drilling a few holes a 00 or 0 spade bit and 00 or 00 electric drill will do  if youre doing a lot or are working with elderly lumber we recommend a 00 drill rightangle drills are wonderful  can be rented and 00 or 0 screwpoint auger drill bits  these bits pull you through so theyre much faster and less fatiguing even in 00 year old hardwood timbers  screwdriver bits are useful for drills expecially if you install your electrical boxes using screws drywall screws work well  for stripping wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinary wire cutters  dont buy the 0 kmart combo stripper crimper and bottle opener types  you should expect to pay 00 to 00 for a good pliertype pair  it will have sized stripping holes and wont nick or grab the wire  it should be easy to strip wire with it  one model has a small hole in the blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals  there are fancier types autostripcut but they generally arent necessary and pros usually dont use them  a pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends in constricted places  dont use these for stripping wire  you will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts  you should have a pair of needlenose pliers for fiddling inside boxes and closing loops but its better to form wire loops with a loop former hole on your wire stripper  more accurate  if youre using nonmetallic cable get a cable stripper for removing the sheath  or do what some pros do they nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a zipper and cut the sheath off  you shouldnt try to strip the sheath with a knife point because its too easy to slash the insulation on the conductors  apparently stanley utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters hooked blades can be used to strip sheath but there is still the possibility that youll gouge the conductors  for any substantial amount of work with armored cable its well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter us 00 hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire or the insulation  threeprong outlet testers are a quick check for properlywired outlets  about 0  multimeters tell you more but are a lot more expensive and probably not worth it for most people  a simple voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulated wire not supplying any devices is extremely helpful they cost about us 00 at radio shack  you should have a voltage detector  to check that the wires are dead before doing work on them  neonbulb version are cheap 00 and work well  if you get more serious a audible alarm type is good for tracing circuits without a helper  though ive been known to lock the drill on and hit breakers until the scream stops   for running wires through existing walls you need fish tape often two tapes are needed though sometimes a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice  fish tapes can be rented  electrical tape  lots of it   seriously a good and competent wiring job will need very little tape  the tape is useful for wrapping dicy insulation in repair work  another use is to wrap  around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination screws  i dont do this but drywall contractors prefer it to prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that has no cover plate   the ul stands for underwriters laboratory  it used to be an insurance industry organization but now it is independent and nonprofit  it tests electrical components and equipment for potential hazards  when something is ullisted that means that the ul has tested the device and it meets their requirements for safety  ie fire or shock hazard  it doesnt necessarily mean that the device actually does what its supposed to just that it probably wont kill you  the ul does not have power of law in the us  you are permitted to buy and install nonullisted devices  however insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to the failure of a nonullisted device  furthermore in many situations the nec will require that a wiring component used for a specific purpose is ullisted for that purpose indirectly this means that certain parts of your wiring must be ullisted before an inspector will approve it andor occupancy permits issued   every electrical device or component must be certified by the canadian standards association before it can be sold in canada  implicit in this is that all wiring must be done with csaapproved materials  they perform testing similar to the ul a bit more stringent except that csa approval is required by law  again like the ul if a fire was caused by noncsaapproved equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the claim  in canada there is a branch organization of the ul called ulc ul of canada  ulc does not have power of law and seems to be more a liason group between the csa and insurance companies   usa the following three books were suggested by our readers      residential wiring     by jeff markell     craftsman books     carlsbad ca for 0000 isbn 0000000000      practical electrical wiring     residential farm and industrial  based on the national     electrical code    ansinfpa 00     herbert p richter and w creighton schwan     mcgrawhill book co      wiring simplified     h p richter and w c schwan     park publishing co  try to make sure that the book is based on the latest nec revision  which is currently 0000  canada ps knight authors and publishes a book called electrical code simplified  there appears to be a version published specific to each province and is very tied into the appropriate provincial code  it focuses on residential wiring and is indispensible for canadian diyers  it is better to get this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring or answer questions on the net   it is updated each time the provincial codes are  this book is available at all diy and hardware stores for less than c00   most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and inspections of any wiring that is done  amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reasons like insurance companies not liking to have to pay claims a permit and inspections provides some assurance that you your family your neighbors or subsequent owners of your home dont get killed or lose their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job  most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your home or order you to tear out any wiring done without a permit  california for instance is particularly nasty about this  if fire starts in your home and uninspected wiring is at fault insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage claims  in general the process goes like this  you apply to your local inspections office or building   department for a permit  you should have a sketch or   detailed drawing of what you plan on doing  this is   a good time to ask questions on any things youre not   sure of  if youre doing major work they may impose   special conditions on you require loading   calculations and ask other questions  at this point   they will tell you which inspections you will need  if youre installing a main panel you will need to   have the panel and service connections inspected   before your power utility will provide a connection   this is sometimes done by the local power authority   rather than the usual inspectors  after installing the boxes and wiring but before   the insulationwalls go up you will need a   roughin inspection  after the walls are up and the wiring is complete   you will need a final inspection  do i have to upgrade  in general there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings though there are some exceptions ie smoke detectors in some cases  however any new work must be done according to the latest electrical code  also if you do major work you may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all of your system  check with your local electrical inspector   one thing where things might get a bit confusing is the different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of a circuit  one person might talk about 000v another 000v or another 000v  these are all in fact exactly the same thing  in north america the utility companies are required to supply a splitphase 000 volt 0 feed to your house this works out as two 000v  0 legs  additionally since there are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring its not unreasonable to find 000v has dropped to 000v or 000v has dropped to 000v by the time the power reaches a wall outlet  especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run  for a number of reasons some historical some simple personal orneryness different people choose call them by slightly different numbers this faq has chosen to be consistent with calling them 000v and 000v except when actually saying what the measured voltage will be  confusing  a bit  just ignore it  one thing that might make this a little more understandable is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ie 000v instead of 000v value  what this implies is that the device is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that low  000v is not the same as 000v  000v is the voltage between phases of a 0phase y circuit that is 000v from neutral to any hot   000v is the voltage between phases of a 0phase y circuit thats 000v from hot to neutral  in keeping with 000v versus 000v strangeness motors intended to run on 000v three phase are often labelled as 000v   there are logically four wires involved with supplying the main panel with power  three of them will come from the utility pole and a fourth bare wire comes from elsewhere   the bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded  into the ground or to a wire buried in the foundation or sometimes  to the water supply pipe has to be metal continuous to where the main water pipe entering the house  watch out for galvanic action conductivity breaks often between copper and iron pipe this is the grounding conductor  it is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground  this wire normally carries no current  one of the other wires will be white or black with white or yellow stripes or sometimes simply black  it is the neutral wire it is connected to the centre tap cec center tap in the nec of the distribution transformer supplying the power  it is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place often inside the panel  the neutral and ground should not be connected anywhere else  otherwise weird andor dangerous things may happen  furthermore there should only be one grounding system in a home  some codes require more than one grounding electrode these will be connected together or connected to the neutral at a common point  still one grounding system  adding additional grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house wiring is unsafe and contrary to code  if you add a subpanel the ground and neutral are usually brought as separate conductors from the main panel and are not connected together in the subpanel ie still only one neutralground connection  however in some situations  certain categories of separate buildings you actually do have to provide a second grounding electrode  consult your inspector  the other two wires will usually be black and are the hot wires  they are attached to the distribution transformer as well  the two black wires are 000 degrees out of phase with each other  this means if you connect something to both hot wires the voltage will be 000 volts  if you connect something to the white and either of the two blacks you will get 000v  some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them this is either because the neutral and ground are connected together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one wire is doing dualduty as both neutral and ground or in some rare occasions the service has only one hot wire 000v only service   inside the panel connections are made to the incoming wires these connections are then used to supply power to selected portions of the home  there are three different combinations 0 one hot one neutral and ground 000v circuit 0 two hots no neutral and ground 000v circuit 0 two hots neutral and ground 000v circuit  neutral    andor two 000v circuits with a common neutral  0 is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and lighting within your house  0 is usually used for supplying power to major appliances such as stoves and dryers  they often have need for both 000v and 000v or for bringing several circuits from the panel box to a distribution point  0 is usually for special 000v motor circuits electric heaters or air conditioners  note in the us the nec frequently permits a circuit similar to 0 be used for stoves and dryers  namely that there are two hot wires and a wire that does dual duty as neutral and ground and is connected to the frame as well as providing the neutral for 000v purposes  three prong plugs instead of four only for stovesdryers connected to the main panel when connected to most subpanels 0 prong plugs and receptacles are required  in our notsohumble opinion this is crazy but the nfpa claims that this practice was reevaluated for the 0000 nec and found to be safe  check your local codes or inquire as to local practice  there are restrictions on when this is permissible  0 is usually wired with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for grounding  0 and 0 have one hot wire coloured red the other black a bare wire for grounding and in 0 a white wire for neutral  you will sometimes see 0 wired with just a black white and ground wire  since the white is hot in this case both the nec and cec requires that the white wire be permanently marked at the ends to indicate that it is a live wire  usually done with paint nail polish or sometimes electrical tape  each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse  there are in a few locales circuits that look like 0 0 or 0 except that they have two bare ground wires  some places require this for hot tubs and the like one ground is frame ground the other attaches to the motor  this may or may not be an alternative to gfci protection   according to the terminology in the cec and nec the grounding conductor is for the safety ground ie the green or bare wire  the word neutral is reserved for the white when you have a circuit with more than one hot wire  since the white wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the panel the proper term is grounded conductor  however the potential confusion between grounded conductor and grounding conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistakes  you should never use the bare wire as a grounded conductor or white wire as the grounding conductor even though they are connected together in the panel  but not in subpanels  subpanels are fed neutral and ground separately from the main panel  usually  in the trade and in common usage the word neutral is used for grounded conductor  this faq uses neutral simply to avoid potential confusion  we recommend that you use neutral too  thus the white wire is always except in some light switch applications neutral  not ground   fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels  for example if your toaster shorts out a fuse or breaker should trip protecting the wiring in the walls from melting  as such fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the wiring  ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself wont cause a fire  fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt safely when the current exceeds the rated value thereby interrupting the power to the circuit  fuses trip relatively fast  which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have large startup current surges  for motor circuits you can use a timedelay fuse one brand is fusetron which will avoid tripping on momentary overloads  a fusetron looks like a springloaded fuse  a fuse can only trip once then it must be replaced  breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices  they usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched into position against another contact  when the current flow through the device exceeds the rated value a bimetallic strip heats up and bends  by bending it trips the latch and the spring pulls the contacts apart  circuit breakers behave similarly to fusetrons  that is they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses  with high overloads they trip quickly  breakers can be reset a finite number of times  each time they trip or are thrown when the circuit is in use some arcing takes place which damages the contacts  thus breakers should not be used in place of switches unless they are specially listed for the purpose  neither fuses nor breakers limit the current per se  a dead short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time which can often cause severe damage   statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher risk of causing a fire than breaker panels  this is usually due to the fuse being loosely screwed in or the contacts corroding and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse being installed or the proverbial replace the fuse with a penny trick  since breakers are more permanently installed and have better connection mechanisms the risk of fire is considerably less  fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload  when a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting path  result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel melted service wiring through fires in the electrical distribution transformer and having your house burn down breakers dont do this  many jurisdictions particularly in canada no longer permit fuse panels in new installations  the nec does permit new fuse panels in some rare circumstances requiring the special inserts to key the fuseholder to specific size fuses  some devices notably certain large air conditioners require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel  the fuse is there to protect the motor windings from overload  check the labeling on the unit  this is usually only on large permanently installed motors  the installation instructions will tell you if you need one   for a 00 amp circuit use 00 gauge wire  for a 00 amp circuit you can use 00 gauge wire in most locales  for a long run though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid voltage drops  00 gauge is only slightly more expensive than 00 gauge though its stiffer and harder to work with  heres a quick table for normal situations  go up a size for more than 000 foot runs when the cable is in conduit or ganged with other wires in a place where they cant dissipate heat easily  gaugeamps 0000 0000 0000 000 000  we dont list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent on the application and precise wire type   there are two considerations voltage drop and heat buildup the smaller the wire is the higher the resistance is  when the resistance is higher the wire heats up more and there is more voltage drop in the wiring  the former is why you need highertemperature insulation andor bigger wires for use in conduit the latter is why you should use larger wire for long runs  neither effect is very significant over very short distances there are some very specific exceptions where use of smaller wire is allowed  the obvious one is the line cord on most lamps  dont try this unless youre certain that your use fits one of those exceptions you can never go wrong by using larger wire   this is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors in a cable  the first number specifies the gauge  the second the number of current carrying conductors in the wire  but remember theres usually an extra ground wire  000 means 00 gauge two insulated current carrying wires plus bare ground  0 wire usually has a black white and bare ground wire  sometimes the white is red instead for 000v circuits without neutral  in the latter case the sheath is usually red too  0 wire usually has a black red white and bare ground wire usually carrying 000v with neutral  used  a wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy thats used to connect wires together  marrette or marr connector are trade names  youll usually use a lot of them in diy wiring  in essence you strip the end of the wires about an inch twist them together then twist the wirenut on  though some wirenuts advertise that you dont need to twist the wire do it anyways  its more mechanically and electrically secure  there are many different sizes of wire nut  you should check that the wire nut youre using is the correct size for the quantity and sizes of wire youre connecting together  dont just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or your fingers  use a pair of blunt nose linesman pliers and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly  sometimes its a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it goes in the wirenut properly  some people wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical tape  this is probably not a good idea  the inspector may tear it off during an inspection  its usually done because a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut  instead of taping it the connection should be redone   a gfci is a groundfault circuit interrupter  it measures the current current flowing through the hot wire and the neutral wire  if they differ by more than a few milliamps the presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other path  this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance or to the ground lead or through a person  any of these situations is hazardous so the gfci trips breaking the circuit  gfcis do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks  if for example you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral leads of a circuit and no part of you was grounded a gfci wouldnt help  all of the current that passed from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead keeping the gfci happy  the two pairs of connections on a gfci outlet are not symmetric one is labeled load the other line  the incoming power feed must be connected to the line side or the outlet will not be protected  the load side can be used to protect all devices downstream from it  thus a whole string of outlets can be covered by a single gfci outlet   the nec mandates gfcis for 000v 00a or 00a single phase outlets in bathrooms kitchens within 0 of the sink garages unfinished basements or crawl spaces outdoors near a pool or just about anywhere else where youre likely to encounter water or dampness  there are exceptions for inaccessible outlets those dedicated to appliances occupying fixed space typically refrigerators and freezers and for sump pumps and laundry appliances  the cec does not mandate as many gfcis  in particular there is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets or most garage or basement outlets  basement outlets must be protected if you have a dirt floor garage outlets if theyre near the door to outside  bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have gfcis  even if you are not required to have gfci protection you may want to consider installing it anyway  unless you need a gfci breaker see below the cost is low  in the us gfci outlets can cost as little as us0  costs are a bit higher in canada  c00  evaluate your own risk factors  does your finished basement ever get wet  do you have small children do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools  does water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage   gfcis are generally not used on circuits that a dont pose a safety risk and b are used to power equipment that must run unattended for long periods of time  refrigerators freezers and sump pumps are good examples  the rationale is that gfcis are sometimes prone to nuisance trips  some people claim that the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary current imbalance tripping the gfci  note though that most gfci trips are real if youre getting a lot of trips for no apparent reason youd be welladvised to check your wiring before deciding that the gfci is broken or useless   for most situations you can use either a gfci outlet as the first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with a builtin gfci  the former is generally preferred since gfci breakers are quite expensive  for example an ordinary ge breaker costs us0 the gfci model costs us00  there is one major exception  if you need to protect a multiwire branch circuit two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire such as a canadianstyle kitchen circuit youll need a multipole gfci breaker  unfortunately these are expensive the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars depending on what brand of panel box you have  but if you must protect such a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice  one more caveat  gfci outlets are bulky  you may want to use an oversize box when installing them  on second thought use large actually deep boxes everywhere  youll thank yourself for it  incidentally if youre installing a gfci to ensure that one specific outlet is protected such as a bathroom you dont really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom and not gfci anything upstream of it  but protecting the whole circuit is preferred  when you install a gfci its a good idea to use the little ground fault protected stickers that come with it and mark the outlets downstream of the gfci  you can figure out which outlets are downstream simply by tripping the gfci with the test button and see which outlets are dead   apart from their use in electronics which we wont comment on and for certain fluorescent lights they wont turn on without a good ground connection theyre intended to guard against insulation failures within the device  generally the case of the appliance is connected to the ground lead  if theres an insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case the ground lead conducts the electricity away safely and possibly trips the circuit breaker in the process  if the case is not grounded and such a short occurs the case is live  and if you touch it while youre grounded youll get zapped  of course if the circuit is gfciprotected it will be a very tiny zap  which is why you can use gfcis to replace ungrounded outlets both nec and cec  there are some appliances that should never be grounded  in particular that applies to toasters and anything else with exposed conductors  consider  if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster and youre not grounded nothing will happen  if youre slightly grounded youll get a small shock the resistance will be too high  but if the case were grounded and you were holding it youd be the perfect path to ground   nowadays many twoprong devices have one prong wider than the other  this is so that the device could rely not guaranteed on one specific wire being neutral and the other hot this is particularly advantageous in light fixtures where the the shell should neutral safety or other devices which want to have an approximate ground reference ie some radios  most 0prong extension cords have wide prongs too  this requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right way around  you want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow one hot  most outlets have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter coloured screw for the neutral if not you can usually figure out which is which by which prong the terminating screw connects to   the nec requires at least two 00 amp small appliance circuits for kitchens  the cec requires splitduplex receptacles  outlets must be installed such that no point is more than 00 nec 000 mm cec from an outlet  every counter wider than 00 nec or 000 mm cec must have at least one outlet the circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except in the kitchen pantry or dining room  furthermore these circuits are in addition to any required for refrigerators stoves microwaves lighting etc  nondedicated outlets within 0 of a sink must be protected by a gfci nec only  split duplex receptacles are fed with a 000v circuit  the tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot goes to the upper outlet and the other hot goes to the lower outlet the neutral connects to both outlets through one screw  when carrying through to another outlet the neutral must be pigtailed such that removing the outlet or having the neutral connection fall off doesnt cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlets   there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in the light fixture  all such outlets must be gfciprotected   romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire sometimes called nonmetallic sheath  the formal name is nm this is suitable for use in dry protected areas ie inside stud walls on the sides of joists etc that are not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat  most newer homes are wired almost exclusively with nm wire  there are several different categories of nm cable  bx cable  technically known as armored cable or ac has a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is fairly resistant to damage  teck cable is ac with an additional external thermoplastic sheath  protection for cable in concealed locations where nm or ac cable is run through studs joists or similar wooden members the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least 00mm000 cec  nec from the edges of the wooden members or the cable should be protected from mechanical injury  this latter protection can take the form of metal plates such as spare outlet box ends or conduit  note inspectorpermitted practise in canada suggests that armored cable or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection but this is technically illegal  additional protection recommendations these are rules in the canadian codes  they are reasonable answers to the vague references to exposed to mechanical damage in both the nec and cec       nm cable should be protected against mechanical damage       where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls       in exposed locations under 0 feet from the floor       ie use ac instead flexible conduit wooden guards etc      where cable is suspended as in connections to furnaces       or water heaters the wire should be protected  canadian       practise is usually to install a junction or outlet       box on the wall and use a short length of ac cable       or nm cable in flexible conduit to jump to the appliance       stapling nm to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used      where nm cable is run in close proximity to heating       ducts or pipe heat transfer should be minimized by       means of a 00mm0 air space or suitable insulation       material a wad of fiberglass      nm cable shall be supported within 000mm0 of every box       or fitting and at intervals of no more than 00m0       holes in joists or studs are considered supports       some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to       each box  while fishing cable is technically in violation       it is permitted where proper support is impractical      0 conductor nm cable should never be stapled on edge       knight also insists on only one cable per staple referring       to the workmanship clause but this seems more honoured       in the breach      cable should never be buried in plaster cement or       similar finish      cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards      cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists       or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more       than 0m 00  whenever bx cable is terminated at a box with a clamp small plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through the insulation  bx is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by solid wall coverings  in places where damage is more likely like on the back wall of a garage  you may be required to use conduit a ul or csa approved metal pipe  you use various types of fittings to join the pipe or provide entranceexit for the wire  service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit  in damp places eg buried wiring to outdoor lighting you will need special wire eg cec nmw00 nec uf  nmw00 looks like very heavyduty nmd00  you will usually need short lengths of conduit where the wire entersexits the ground  see underground wiring section   thermoplastic sheath wire such as nm nmw etc should not be  exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that  purpose  many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through furnace ducts including cold air return plenums constructed by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces   the reason for this is that if theres a fire the ducting will spread toxic gasses from burning insulation very rapidly through the building teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas   canada appears to use similar wire designations to the us  except that canadian wire designations usually include the  temperature rating in celsius  eg ac00 versus ac in the us nmb is 00 degrees celcius  note local codes vary  this is one of the items that changes most often  eg chicago codes require conduit everywhere there are very different requirements for mobile homes check your local codes especially if youre doing anything thats the slightest out of the ordinary  wire selection table incomplete  the real tables are enormous uncommon wire types or applications omitted

nonmetallic cable only  the reasoning is simple  with armored cable the box itself provides ground conductor continuity  us plastic boxes dont use metal cable clamps  the cec is slightly different  the cec never permits cable armor as a grounding conductor  however you must still provide ground continuity for metallic sheath  the cec also requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes  the advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for nonmetallic sheathed cable  you can avoid making one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little less  on the other hand plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts  for exposed or shop wiring metal boxes are probably better   a junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together  junction boxes must be located in such a way that theyre accessible later  ie not buried under plaster  excessive use of junction boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation and inspectors may get nasty   in general one can replace fixtures freely subject to a few caveats  first of course one should check the amperage rating of the circuit  if your heart is set on installing half a dozen 000 watt floodlights you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box  but there are some more subtle constraints as well  for example older house wiring doesnt have hightemperature insulation  the excess heat generated by a ceilingmounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad results some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high temperature wire only  you may find in fact that your ceiling wiring already has this problem in which case replacing any devices is a real adventure  other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixtures and making sure that the ceiling box and its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan  you may need to install a new box specifically listed for this purpose  a 0x0 across the ceiling joists makes a good support  metal brackets are also available that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and mounted between the joists  there are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as pot lamps or heat lamps  when these are installed in insulated ceilings they can present a very substantial fire hazard the cec provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated ceilings provided that the fixture is boxed in a coffin usually 0x00x00  made by making a pair of joists 00 high and covering with plywood that doesnt have any insulation  yes thats 0 feet long  nec rules are somewhat less stringent  they require at least 0 clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation the rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement which means that a cecstyle coffin might be worthwhile presumably thats up to the local inspector  the cec doesnt actually mandate the coffin perse this seems to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture cant get accidentally buried in insulation  ie if you have insulation blown in later  there are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation  they are usually limited to 00 watt bulbs and are unfortunately somewhat more expensive than the older types  before you use them you should ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such uses follow the installation instructions carefully the prescribed location for the sensor can vary  there does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved for use in insulation  the coffin appears the only legal approach   this usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is loose  depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up being more than 000v and the other less than 000v with respect to ground  this is a very hazardous situation  it can destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fires and in some situations electrocute you ie some us jurisdictions require the stove frame connected to neutral  if this happens contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem  note a brief  0 second brightening is sometimes normal with lighting and motors on the same 000v with neutral circuit  a loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness far longer than one second  in case of doubt get help   three phase power has three hot wires 000 degrees out of phase with each other  these are usually used for large motors because it is more efficient provides a bit more starting torque and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper  youre most likely to encounter a 0 phase circuit that shows 000 volts between any hot and ground and 000 volts between any two hots  the latter shows the difference between a normal 000v000v common neutral circuit which is 000 volts between the two hots  there are 0 phase circuits with different voltages  bringing in a 0 phase feed to your house is usually ridiculously expensive or impossible  if the equipment you want to run has a standard motor mount it is much cheaper to buy a new 000v or 000v motor for it  in some cases it is possible to run 0 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor as a autogenerator  these are tricky but are a good solution if the motor is nonstandard size or too expensive or too big to replace  the taunton press book the small shop has an article on how to do this if you must  note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using such a converter  the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that   theoretically it doesnt make any difference  however there is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply wiring  all things being equal a 000v motor will lose 0 times less power in the house wiring than a 000v motor  this also means that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor will get to speed quicker  and in some circumstances the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life  this is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more than 00 feet long   it is a universal physical law that 0 hp is equal to 000 watts  given heating loss power factor and other inefficiencies it is usually best to consider 0 hp is going to need 00000000 watts  a 000v 00a circuit can only deliver 0000 watts to a motor so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 0 hp  given rational efficiency factors 00hp is more like it  some equipment manufacturers sears in particular most router manufacturers in general  advertise a hp rating that is far in excess of what is possible  they are giving you a stall horsepower or similar  that means the power is measured when the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load what they dont mention is that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker will trip otherwise the motor will melt  its drawing far more current than it can continuously  when comparing motors compare the continuous horsepower  this should be on the motor nameplate  if you cant find that figure check the amperage rating which is always present   older homes frequently have twoprong receptacles instead of the more modern three  these receptacles have no safety ground and the cabling usually has no ground wire  neither the nec or cec permits installing new 0 prong receptacles anymore  there are several different approaches to solving this     0 if the wiring is done through conduit or bx and the        conduit is continuous back to the panel you can connect        the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle        box  nec mainly  cec frowns on this practise     0 if there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby and        its continuous to the main house ground point you can        run a conductor to it from the third prong     0 run a ground conductor back to the main panel     0 easiest install a gfci receptacle  the ground lug        should not be connected to anything but the gfci        protection itself will serve instead  the gfci        will also protect downstream possibly also two prong        outlets  if you do this to protect downstream outlets        the grounds must not be connected together  since it        wouldnt be connected to a real ground a wiring fault        could energize the cases of 0 prong devices connected        to other outlets  be sure though that there arent        indirect ground plug connections such as via the sheath        on bx cable  the cec permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the u ground with a nonconducting goop like caulking compound  this is not permitted in the nec  should the test button work  were sure about what the nec and cec say  remember though that your local codes may vary  as for the test button  theres a resistor connecting the load side of the hot wire to the line side of the neutral wire when you press the test button  current through this resistor shows up as an imbalance and trips the gfci this is a simple passive and reliable test and doesnt require a real ground to work  if your gfci does not trip when you press the test button it is very probably defective or miswired  again if the test button doesnt work somethings broken and potentially dangerous  the problem should be corrected immediately  the instructions that come with some gfcis specify that the ground wire must be connected  we do not know why they say this  the causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet or with the formalities of ul or csa listing  perhaps the device was never tested without the ground wire being connected  on the other hand ul or csa approval should only have been granted if the device behaves properly in all listed applications including ungrounded outlet replacement  one of us called leviton their gfcis are labeled for installation on grounded circuits only  the technician was surprised to see that he agreed that the nec does not require it and promised to investigate   as with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all devices that will be on simultaneously  the code specifies that you should stay under 00 of the nominal capacity of the circuit  for typical home shop use this means one circuit for the major power tools and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac  use at least 00 gauge wire  many power tools have big motors with a big startup surge  if you can use 00 amp breakers nec though cec requires standard 00a receptacles which means youd have to replug all your equipment  lights should either be on a circuit of their own  and not shared with circuits in the rest of the house  or be on at least two separate circuits  the idea is that you want to avoid a situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand rpm while youre groping in the dark for the off switch  do install lots of outlets  its easier to install them in the beginning when you dont have to cut into an existing cable its useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you really want  but use metal boxes and plates and maybe even metalsheathed cable you may have objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit wrong  note that some jurisdictions have a no horizontal wiring rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used for working  what this means is that all wiring must be run along structural members  ie stapled to studs  other possible shop circuits include heater circuits 000v circuits for some large tools and air compressor circuits dont overload circuits and dont use extension cords if you can help it unless theyre rated for high currents  a coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gauge  also the insulation wont withstand as much heat and heat dissipation is the critical issue  if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop wiring from it  if you have young children you may want to equip this panel with a cutoff switch and possibly a lock if you want to install individual switches to safe particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high enough for example ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the startup surge generated by a table saw  buy horsepowerrated switches instead  finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply  and even if you know that youd never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might have a different idea  note fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop wiring  april 0000 is one place to start   you will need to prepare a trench to specifications use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber dont use creosoted lumber it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead  the transition from inhouse to underground wire is generally via conduit  all outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets fittings etc  if the location of the box is subject to immersion in water a more serious style of waterproof box is needed  and of course dont forget the gfcis  the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation  a hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed   during the 0000s aluminum instead of copper wiring became quite popular and was extensively used  since that time aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations we recommend even if youre allowed to that do not use it for new wiring  but dont panic if your house has aluminum wiring  aluminum wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as copper aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper installation  we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems and what you can do to make your wiring safe  the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as cold creep  when aluminum wiring warms up it expands  when it cools down it contracts  unlike copper when aluminum goes through a number of warmcool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each time  to make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance of the connection goes up  which causes it to heat up and corrode oxidize still more  eventually the wire may start getting very hot melt the insulation or fixture its attached to and possibly even cause a fire  since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the 00s we will cover basic points of safe aluminum wiring  we suggest that if youre considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things      0 fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to        aluminum wiring should be rated for it  the device will        be stamped with alcu or coalr  the latter supersedes        the former but both are safe   these fixtures are somewhat        more expensive than the ordinary ones      0 wires should be properly connected at least 00 way around        the screw in a clockwise direction  connections should be        tight  while repeated tightening of the screws can make the        problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug        up each connection         note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the        main service entrance cable  it should be inspected      0 pushin terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire        any connections using pushin terminals should be redone with        the proper screw connections immediately      0 there should be no signs of overheating darkened connections        melted insulation or baked fixtures  any such damage should        be repaired          0 connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be        handled specially  current canadian codes require that the        wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting        aluminum to copper  the nec requires that the wire be        connected together using special crimp devices with an        antioxidant grease  the tools and materials for the latter        are quite expensive  not practical to do it yourself unless        you can rent the tool      0 any nonrated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring        by means of a short copper pigtail  see 0 above          0 shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped        not nicked wire etc      if when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wiring safe  if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere  if the wrong receptacles are used you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails  having this professionally done can range from 0 to 00 per receptacleswitch you can do this yourself too   congratulations  but  its generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as well  if an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any minor problems are fixed  if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere  heres some hints on what to look for  obvious noncode wiring can include   zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls  hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without   proper marking  ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of   a gfci  splices hanging in midair other than proper knobandtube  switched neutrals  unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines  certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one time sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations   switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps    not properly terminated wiring  a wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are   separately controlled by other wall switches  except when   its really convenient   switches and outlets in bizarre locations  great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps  junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them  wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or   ceiling  backwrapped grounding wires   in the years since edison invented electricity several different wiring styles have come and gone  when you buy an older home you may encounter some of this stuff  this section describes the old  methods and some of their idiosyncrasies  the oldest wiring system youre likely to encounter is called knob and tube kt  it is made up of individual conductors with a cloth insulation  the wires are run along side structural members eg joists or studs using ceramic standoffs knobs wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes  connections were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping with tape  since the hot and neutral were run separately the wiring tends to be rather confusing  a neutral often runs down the centre of each room with taps off to each fixture the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next  in some cases kt isnt colourcoded so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wires  youll see kt in homes built as late as the 00s  comments on kt   the people installing kt were pretty paranoid about   electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good  the wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up   very well  most kt ive seen for example is in   quite good condition  no grounding  grounding is usually difficult to install  boxes are small  receptacle replacement particularly with   gfci can be difficult  no bushing on boxes either   so wiring changes need special attention to box entry  sometimes the neutral isnt balanced very well between   separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to   overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on   any circuit  building code does not permit insulation in walls   that contain kt  connection to existing kt from new circuits can be   tricky  consult your inspector  modern wiring practise requires considerably more   outlets to be installed than kt systems did  since kt tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isnt necessary to replace it simply because its kt  what you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit loading  in many cases its perfectly reasonable to leave existing kt alone and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern techniques  after kt they invented multiconductor cable  the first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation  it looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or two  this stuff was used in the 00s and 00s  again no grounding conductor it was installed much like modern wiring  its major drawback is that this type of insulation embrittles  weve seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch  bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems  this stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become bare  this wiring should be left untouched as much as possible  whenever an opportunity arises replace it a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heatshrink tubing  after this wiring technique the more modern romex was invented its almost a asphalt impregnated cloth  often a bit sticky this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesnt present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work with  it does not need to be replaced  it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff  thermoplastic insulation wire  just dont abuse it too much   try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you  their prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or diy centres have better quality materials have wider variety including the odd stuff and have people behind the counter that know what youre talking about  cultivate friendly knowledgeable sales people  theyll give you much valuable information   chris lewis clewisferretocunixonca phone canada 000 0000000 psroff 00 info psroffrequestferretocunixonca ferret list ferretrequestferretocunixonca

   i want to upgrade my system and was thinking of buying adcom seperates  i have heard from alot of people though that adcom sounds great but  that the components are made cheaply and therefore wont last very long  the time estimates ive heard are like only 0 or 0 years  is this true  i own the adcom 00w power amp  as far as im concerned theres no   amp which can touch it at the price range the build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other    amps in the price range  the whole amplifier is extremely solid   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing if you open the amp up there are only very good quality components    in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well  perfect   symmetry for both channels and two transformers  one for each   channel  the binding posts on the back of the amplifier are   virtually the same as those on the classe model 00 ie very good  i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast   or whereever  but if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant i cannot see why people say the amplifier wont last  not with   those quality components inside  sure the amp runs very fairly   hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good  my last point i recently auditioned the adcom preamp something like   the 000 or something  it was two years old and it still sounded   like new  if you build an amplifier decently like the adcoms they will   sound brilliant and last a long time  period  just my thoughts but then  i do own one of adcoms amps        alan webber                                                                           webbitu0sunacza                                                 webbitu0sunacza                                                                                                the path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high    the ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by            apprehension creeping like a chootrain up your spine               will the tightrope reach the end will the final couplet rhyme

  i missed the first articles on this line due to not having a chance to read the news for a couple of days  the idea is commercialized in at least one product the private eye  thats a small cubeshaped device that the user straps around the head similar to a sweat band  there is a boom that comes from the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned in front of the users eye  the private eye we had here for evaluation was herculesmda compatible  the innards are a row 000 leds that are swept up and down by a galvonometerlike movement  the result is that the sweeping led bar forms a fused raster  there is a virtual image projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse with the background  i didnt like the device very much  i found it easiest to use if i looked at a blank white wall  i had problems with focus tracking if i glanced down to look at my keyboard for an outoftheway key the unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which i found annoying  some people didnt seem to mind the buzz  properly used however the image clarity was quite crisp  i dont know if the company has taken the technology any further in the last year or two but it did seem to have promise     bill mayhew      neoucom computer services department rootstown oh  000000000  usa    phone 0000000000 wtmuhuraneoucomedu 00000000    000000 n0wed  
   offshore assembly is one reason that adcom is able to make products  that perform as well as those from people like audio research and van  alstine and better than hafler and forte but at a much lower cost   how do you spell tuna helper    i gather by offshore assembly you mean that adcoms are built by  bluefin tunas who are into that squidfi sound  i agree on that one  my adcom 000 preamp did sound better after installing the famous   running the chips class a resistor mod and replacing the metal  bottom cover with plexiglass too bad the factory could not make em sound  better but better sound unfortunately does not appear to be a priority  with adcom else the mods would neither have been necessary nor would they  have improved what was already touted as superlative stateodart lesound  i really want to hear from all those people out there who have traded up   from an sp0ii even an sp0a to a gfp000etc or maybe from those that  have dumped their forte amps for a gfa000etc      
  i have an adcom gfa000 that i got in 0000  there certainly isnt anything magic about it  the components used are decent but nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components  the gfa000 is a nice piece of equipment  im glad that adcom had the guts to not overdo the packaging  it irks me when i see audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they are supposed to serve  i dont see any big deal about the geographic region in which something is assembled  this is especially true for something as lowtechnology as a gfa000  id hope that a gfa000 would still work well after several years except under conditions of extreme abuse there isnt much there to go wrong     bill mayhew      neoucom computer services department rootstown oh  000000000  usa    phone 0000000000 wtmuhuraneoucomedu 00000000    000000 n0wed

  hi i am looking for some help in choosing a package for a highspeed silicon adc 000mhz currently being  fabricated this is a phd research project and i have to test the chip at speed on a pcb i expect to have roughly 000 packaged circuits and will do dc lowspeed and highspeed testing using 0 different setups for the test chip   i know for sure that a dip will not work the long lead lines have too high an inductance getting a custommade package is too expensive so i am trying to choose between a flatpak and a leadless chip carrier the flatpack would be hard to test since it has to be soldered on to the test setup and i would spend loads of time soldering  as i kept changing the test chip the leadless chip carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may not work at high speeds   does anyone out there have experienceknowledge of this field  i would greatly appreciate help any ideas names of companies manufacturing holderssocketspackages would help    ps the multilayer fancy gaas packages seem like a bit of overkill    seema varma

  so  heres my question  it seems to me that id have the same electrical circuit if i hooked the neutral jumper from the neutral over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets whats wrong with my reasoning here  first go to the local hardware store and pick up a copy of wiring simplified by hl richter  now if your house is wired with metal conduit you dont need a seperate ground wire assuming the house is wired correctly and the pipes are connected to a cold water pipe in your basement  the outlets that have a neutral hooked to the ground screw seem wrong  anyone else think so  back in the 00s i was a service technician for a cash register company the cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were very susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise  the biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded  in almost every place we went to do an installation we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral  for 000 of the things you can plug into one of these they work fine  for our cash registers they were a nightmare  line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically  with modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem  even the company i used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment  i imagine if you check most household wiring you will find that the ground and neutral are connected  although not ideal it should be ok for most applications     slmr 00  my reality check just bounced                                   the ozone hole bbs  a private bulletin board service  0000000000 0 full service nodes  usrobotics 000k bps  00 gigs  000000 files skydive new orleans  rime network mail hub  000 usenet newsgroups please route all questions or inquiries to  postmasterozoneholecom

  one thing to consider is time division multiplexing the emg channels to reduce the number of rf carriers you have to generate if you multiplexed the emg inputs at 00khz that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies youd have  000 hz per channel sampling rate  that level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish  combining a lot of rf carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation  a system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced  a commercial handheld transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth obviously this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws govern the use of transeivers in your location     bill mayhew      neoucom computer services department rootstown oh  000000000  usa    phone 0000000000 wtmuhuraneoucomedu 00000000    000000 n0wed

   what you can do if you want threeprong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a gfci outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper  in fact depending on where you are putting your new outlets a gfci may be required  you still need to supply a proper ground for a ground fault circuit interrupter  oddly enough you dont at least according to the wiring faq that is regularly posted on miscconsumershouse  a gfci senses discrepancies between the live and neutral wire currents and cuts them both off if a discrepancy is found  no ground connection is needed for it to function        michael a covington associate research scientist               artificial intelligence programs      mcovingtaiugaedu      the university of georgia              phone 000 0000000           athens georgia 000000000 usa     amateur radio n0tmi

  victorinqmindbisonmbca victor laking writes  you are experiencing what is called macrovision  it is the protection  that they use on the video tapes  there are two ways around this that i  know of  first of all you can try using a different vcr to copy onto it is the input of the vcr that reacts to the protection so sometimes  just switching the two vcrs around will take care of it  some models  just dont react to it  does this also affect the viewing of tapes  i have had problems with a couple of rented tapes they were virtually unviewable i fiddled  with the tuning tracking and vertical hold but it was no good

  crispecsvaxuncecsedu russ crisp writes  so  heres my question  it seems to me that id have the same electrical circuit if i hooked a jumper from the neutral over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets whats wrong with my reasoning here    may i respectfully suggest you not do this  the ground is supposed to be a protective ground and though what you suggest looks good on paper its dangerous to rely on the same wire for power and protection  itd never meet code and if you now own the property and later sell it you may end up with liabilities you dont want and if you dont now own it well  theres a wiring faq that i think addresses this  i believe an alternative is use of a gfci but im really not sure what current code allows in this area  the gfci senses alternate unwanted current paths and doesnt rely on a specific protective ground wire at least not beyond the gfci in the protected circuit  gfci breakers are available but expensive

   stuff deleted  i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast   or whereever  but if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant  good pointalso i wouldnt be surprised that the components they use offshore are of inferior quality  as long as it was properly designed and robust premium components are used it shouldnt matter where it is assembled  i cannot see why people say the amplifier wont last  not with   those quality components inside  sure the amp runs very fairly   hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good  an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how its gonna sound the amp you have probably is running classa the whole day  actually id be wary of excessively hot amps cauz even though the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive  heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component regardless of quality  in fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  hmmmmm  aaron

  allthe devil reincarnateswr meter for cb radios  tdfrom ssaveolecdaccom the devil reincarnate tdorganization cdac wa tdwhat tdis a good choice for a cb 00 or 00 wave td  i read the installation instructions on a 00 wave antenna tdand they suggested that i use an swr to tune it at channel 00 tdand channel 00 for a minimum reading  question is why channel td00 and 00  the best antenna is one that will let out the most wave probably not the  best explanation but the rest makes sense a one wave will cancell itself  out btw no such beastie  the best is a 00 wave antenna followed by  00 then 00 etc  as for swring in what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct  length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on since the  wavelength varies with the channel you use then its recommended to swr  in using the middle channel of those you are going to use anyway in the beginning of cbs all new antennas had to be swred in  nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on so that theres not  much point in swring then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it  anyway  cheers  peter t

  there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here  a few points need to be clarified  the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects  it should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load  some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor    much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  orange outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service  anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems  the code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance  where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod  many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either   the grounded conductor of a circuit often called the neutral which is referred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey  this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel  this connection is through the main bonding jumper  in many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel    the grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor  in the case of a 000 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device    since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions  if you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor  since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end  if the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the u ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential  the difference under normal non shortcircuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two  this normally does not present a shock hazard    however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path  if the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire  it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat  with the incorrect non singlepoint grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire    also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction  i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment  the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling  this is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly  the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer  some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground  there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy  dont flame me on this im just telling you where the field comes from not its health effect as far as im concerned the jury is still out on this  note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at any sub distribution panels  this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral  the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor  if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above  the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another  in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire  every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review  these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before u ground outlets and such  the appliance manufacturers dont want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors dont want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances  no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the 000 volt hots except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage  so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings its primarily for lightning protection  people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isnt a legal grounding conductor  obviously the bare wire in romex with ground is  anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor  the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath  you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you dont have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes    greenfield looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is not a legal grounding conductor as it doesnt have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance  you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield  wiremold is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box  i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with 000 volts why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box  you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever  on another issue while you should ground the green wirelug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available  it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you dont install it  the interrupter doesnt depend on the ground to trip  it is desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path  for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfis read in the nec 0000 d exception this is the 0000 code my 00 code is in the city but i know the rule hasnt changed  it might be renumbered though   we have only touched the surface concerning grounding   there is much more to this subject but most of you have fallen asleep by now    john    john h schmidt

  this is a followup post to something ive written previously  several people responded with good information but i dont think i communicated  exactly what i am looking for im working on a custom io device that will communicate with a host via rs000  my custom circuitry will use an 00c000eb or ec cpu and require about 00k of ram preferably flash ram  in looking around i see that lots of people have engineered uartcpuromram subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom io devices  its been done so much that it  would be best if i can avoid reinventing a system  it just needs to use an 00c000 or 000 cpu and be able to load a program from the host then  transfer control to that program  well theres one other thing the rom needs to know how to do  it should have routines to send and receive bytes tofrom the host that utilize the hardware control lines dtrrtsdtscts everything ive seen is in the 00000 and up range  thats too much for this application  i need something around 00000  the cpu has the uart builtin so youre only looking at a few chips  does anyone know a  company that markets a good board in this range or some public domain  circuitry i can use  thanks in advance for the info  rich

  rubincisohiostateedu daniel j rubin writes how hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular  motorola microcontrollers  not hard you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software but this hogs most of the available cpu cycles on a lowend controller ive seen some application note from philips that used one of their 0000 derivatives as a printer buffer with up to 0mb of dynamic ram that was accessed and refreshed with software bitbanging  another alternative would be to use one of those nice dram controller chips that create static ram appearance and all that but they may be too expensive to make it worthwhile  segmented memory helps structure software

  in c0l0x0kj0vcdhpcom john eaton writes      during the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough to melt when this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling tower where it is sprayed into the air contact with the cool outside air will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor there it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day  cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be power companies are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the raw uranium emisions to be held to under 0 this law is now under attack by lawyers arguing that the 0 should be measured at the edge of the property rather than the edge of the cooling tower eliminating this law will save power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes  john eaton hpvcdjohne   i think you posted your article 00 days too late  april 0st is over i dont like nuclear powerplants but i think its not fair to tell such storys about them ok  let me try to explain what that tower is used to    0st even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steamengine          it has an hightech boiler but the rest is still verry verry           conventional and if youve already visited any condensation          powerstation youl have seen the cooling towers too          if you look at any good book about thermophysics youll find          a chapter about the carnotprocess which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference  and that is the reason          for cooling towers too  you only can get energy if youve an          temperature gradient that means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox 00 of the           energy you or better the uranium brought into the water to          let it boil if you only have hot steam on the one and cold          steam on the other side youll loose much more of the energy          and so they cool down the steam to get at least the 00 of          energy that carnot will give them          the cooling towers are for cooling the steam           the vapor youll see is not the steam of the main core circulation          because that steam is radioactive  the circulation is divided in          at least 0 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment               0nd ok the main core is hot but even in the modernst hightemperature          reactors htr they only run at 000 deg celsius this is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 0000 deg celsius  but youll have lots of problems with          the boilers steel thats because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast          this is only for bwrs the new he cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 0000 deg celsius but this is only experimental      0rd i personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years today 0 mrem and next year 00 mrem wont be 000 mrem          at all it accumulates and even in 00 years youll still have          00 mrem and im not interested in glowing in the night and          getting children with 0 heads this is my point of view            only my 000   christian reisel   student of electronic sciences    christian reisel goldammerweg 0 w0000 buebingen germany voice        00 0000 00000 fax  email  00 0000 00000  pgp pubkey  begin 000 pcrpub mf0lpsq000es00plhfeseaoxp0r0f0qy0qsydz0l0 mmo0kvhu0mx0gmfh0klm000fi0wt0mq 000  end

  naglenetcomcom john nagle writes  great explaination however you left off one detail why do you always see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants  at nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water  as i recall the water isnt as hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination  actually the reasons you dont see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 0 fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller than nuclear plants  000 mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built  the average nuclear plant is 0000 mwe  0 many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted why those old dirt burners cant harm anything let em go   0 powered draft cooling towers low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from offsite are quite popular with fossil plants  0 fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears         actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boilingwater reactor nuclear plants  theres a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 0000 vintage steam technology  so its more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible  hence big cooling towers           oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient  some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one canadian official asked about thermal  pollution deicing a river said up here we view heat as a resource    actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size  the issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from  condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine  the condenser pressure is normally waters vapor pressure at the condensing temperature  it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes  the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best    a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes  since the condenser is at a very low pressure the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity  if the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate  this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs    the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps  how much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell  typically hotwell temperatures run between 000 and 000  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped  when the river water temperature is high in the summer operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head  there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area  at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air  the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers  the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity  it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 00 degrees  a vast difference from the typical 0000 days 00 degrees 00 humidity we see routinely in the east it is not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure         everybody runs closedcycle boilers  the water used is  purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils  purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than  cooling it so the boiler water is recycled  true  actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water  by impure i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity andor a few ppm of dissolved oxygen  secondary water is now typically the most pure one

  aaron lung alungmegatestcom wrote  i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast    or whereever  but if you look in the amp and see what components    they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the    amplifiers sound so brilliant   good pointalso i wouldnt be surprised that the components  they use offshore are of inferior quality  as long as it was  properly designed and robust premium components are used it  shouldnt matter where it is assembled  definately i agree wholeheartedly  if they can build the amp where   the labour is not so expensive they can afford to put decent   components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the   amplifier  as adcom has done   i cannot see why people say the amplifier wont last  not with    those quality components inside  sure the amp runs very fairly    hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good   an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how its gonna sound  the amp you have probably is running classa the whole day   actually id be wary of excessively hot amps cauz even though  the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive   heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component  regardless of quality  in fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is  because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted  to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  hmmmmm  sure i didnt mean to imply that because of the heat generated the   amp sounds good  my adcom gfp 000ii runs fairly warm  not hot to   the touch  but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely i dont like it when an amp runs deadcold  it makes one think that   the amp is doing nothing  the heatsinks that adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for   skimpy  theyre massive things with heating vents both below   and above  more than enough to carry away excessive heat  my opinions once again        alan webber                                                                           webbitu0sunacza                                                 webbitu0sunacza                                                                                                the path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high    the ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by            apprehension creeping like a chootrain up your spine               will the tightrope reach the end will the final couplet rhyme

   i recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the pickup  the result was noisy and distinctly lofi but much louder than a conventional phonograph  it tended to wear the disks out pretty quickly though  this was the pathe you are thinking of although there were other imitators it didnt wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs but it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air there are a lot of them still operating and they are pretty ingenious  there was a pneumatic amplifier designed by alexander graham bell as well but i dont know if it was ever constructed scott

   hi  i was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology  paper and i read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the  tv screen at 0000ths of a second  is that possible  i thought the  maximum rate the tv was even capable of displaying images was 000th  of a second  or 000th of a second for an image composed of only odd  or even scan lines  you are correct the fastest complete image that could be presented on tv would be one field which is 000 of a second approximately  of course the phrase tv screen is often thrown around in reference to any crt display so perhaps this researcher wasnt using normal tv rates  might even be a vector strokewriter display in which case the lower limit on image time is anyones guess and is probably phosphorpersistence limited  actually a lot of this work used to be done with a crt that had a beamsplitter mounted in front and a tachistoscope driving it  the tachistoscope is really just a slide projector with a very fast shutter  low tech but it does the job scott

   i understand that the new gps boxes now have an option known as differential ready  apparently landbased beacons tranmit gps correction information to your gps  receiver with differential option installed  how does this system work  what frequency is used for the landbased beacons  thanks in advance  charlie thompson   heres a rough sketch of how the system works  a reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming gps signals  these errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion sa selective availability time dithering etc  the reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to back out the errors in its position since it knows where it is already  it then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers  if the receivers are nearby 000km and are using the same satellites as the reference unit the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit  thus the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit  the us coast guard is currently as far as i know installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential gps  these stations will use existing radio towers  i believe the frequency is to be approximately 000 khz  there are many other private corporations offering dgps signals on different frequencies  for example pinpoint 0000000000 offers correction signals and receiver units using an fm broadcast system which has stations all across the us  the correction codes are usually transmitted using the rtcm 000 format advertised accuracies espouse 0 to 0 meter errors    john p baker                    my opinions are my own  i dont know johns hopkins university         anyone else who wants them anyway applied physics laboratory laurel md  00000                bakerjp0aplcommjhuapledu

   i dont know why my fpu has an xc my original 00mhz fpu was label mc0000000 but it seems to work fine on my system ps or does it mean experimental chip instead of motorola chip   the rule for the designations is that if it says mc that means it works exactly the way the datasheetbook specifies  if it says xc that means there is at least one known bug  often these bugs are small and obscure you might never run into them in practice  at least motorola admits it unlike certain other companies   all work is one mans work              henry spencer  u of toronto zoology                      kipling             henryzootorontoedu  utzoohenry  
   i have a mosfet pulled out of a trygon power supply for which i have no  manual  its a motorola part with a 0000 date code and the number                 0000  which the motorola folks assure me is a house number which they cant help me with  any suggestions from folks out there  i cant put it on a curve tracer to try to get an equivalent since its completely shot scott since your mosfet is a 0000 vintage its probably not a very good one by  todays standards  if you have an idea about its voltage and current  ratings eg 00vdc  0a you can probably get away with replacing it with  anything with better specs  early mosfets had a gatesource voltage rating  of approximately  00 vdcmax and they would usually turn completely on  at 00vdc  otherwise mosfets are not really mysterious  theyre more or  less voltage controlled current sources  if the mosfet in your circuit is  used as an openloop voltage controlled current source you may have to  experiment with various gainaltering techniques  bill willis     williswcoenwclemsonedu 000 0000000  
  i have never worked with really small signals before and have a few  questions about low level noise  i have noticed that the waveform  synthesizer that i am using analogic 0000 has some relatively large common mode noise on it  i am using this synthesizer to null out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference 000uv several hundred  times  the 0000 has about 00 mvpp of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat  the noise is not quite in sync with  line frequency and on a spectrum analyzer the main component is about 00hz  how can i get rid of the noise  when i look at the spectrum using an hp 0000a audio range analyzer the noise goes away the minute i switch to  isolation on the input  i am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the  input since it will read accurately down to dc  also if i use a differential amplifier ia to solve the problem  how important is it to use one of these shield drivers an amp connected  to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused  by different cable capacitances  if anyone can suggest a good ic ia for  use with transient signals with content from 0khz to about 000khz i would appreciate it

  hi  being a electronic engineering student with only electronic ii under my belt i find myself needing to build a moderate wattage audio amp so  ill throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the net  please explain how watts are calculated in audio amp circuits no not pie just how it relates to one of the following  ai current gain av voltage gain ap power gain or whatever  i already have a wonderful cheap ie 00 schematic for a 00w amp but i would like to crossimprove the circuit the problem is that the parts list has ic0 and ic0 as nec00000ab amplifiers they look like 00 pin  sip packages with a heatsink this schematic was published in a 0000 mag so it may be nonexistant now anyway i tried looking up a replacement in the latest digikey cat and found it  not listed 0 the closes i could figure was a 0 pin sip as tda0000bu anyone got any ideas   i thought hey i can rin a pspice simulation using 000 opamp  models yea great it worked but i guess the 000 wasnt made for high power amps as a result i got a voltage gain of 00mvv worse than i started with 0 does anyone have a pspice ckt file with cheap yet good gain how about some models for some of the chips listed in this  email any ascii chip info you guys can send me   im open to suggestionsideascommentshelp please email since i have little time to search the news  and ill post if theres and interest john          ibm        ee majors do it best 0      atari john d zitterkopf             rulesjdz0ramsstateedu  jdz0msstatebitnet                        aol zittaolcom  jdz0isismsstateedu

  gstovallcrchh00nosubdomainnodomain greg stovall writes anyway over the weekend i was resting on the sofa in between chores and noticed that i briefly picked up what sounded like ham radio traffic over my stereo and television even though both were off  also all the touch sensitive lights in my house start going wacko cycling through  their four brightness states  i presume that some ham operator with an illegal amplifier drove past my house i live on a busy thoroughfare would this be a correct presumption what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects   the affected equipment is about 000 feet from the road  hams can legally run up to 0000 watts  it is very unlikely however that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  ham rigs for cars put out around 000 watts  it is possible that a 000 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 000 feet  away  most tvs stereos and vcrs have very poor rf shielding if you experience the problem frequently it may be  caused by a ham cber or other radio operator in a base station nearby    the interference may have been caused by a radio  transmitter used for other purposes such as police fire etc  if you heard voices over your stereo i think you are correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter  if you have frequent trouble you may want to try the rf ferrite chokes available at radio shack  the interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily without cutting them good instructions are included with the chokes if that does not solve the problem you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator  look for antennas on the roof or car  talk to himher about your problem  there are things a radio operator can do to reduce interference      randall rhea                                        informix software inc  project manager mis salesmarketing systems    uunetpyramidinfmxrandall

   the fujitsu 0000 uses what is known as an smd interface storage module device  a lot of older minis used it  sun still does on their server models  there are several different speeds of smd and i think that the  fuji drive you have is rated at about 00 mbsec thats megabits  there used to be several companies that made couplers for the pc interphase in texas being one but i think that the market pretty much has dried up controllers for this type of drive are readily available for vme buses though  rumor has it that there is a smd to scsi adapter available but i think that it was designed for slower smd devices  in other words if you have a pc or mac that drive is pretty much dogmeat cheers corwin  
   currently i am using the 0000 microcontroller with external eprom  in order to drive the dc motor with direction i use the pulse width modultion   thru software controlassembly language programming however i am afraid that  they will be overheads and thus alter the pulse timing my question is   is the software pwm control reliable i understand that port 0 is a latch  and so i vary the duty cycle by setting it high first and at the desire   duty cycle then i set low any improments

   hi all  im an assistant manager at a local art theater here in columbus  id like to expand our show automation a bit namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up  our current automation consoles date from the early 00s and dont provide this function  we already have the combo failsafecontact rollers to read the cuetapes and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fadeup control circuit 000 vac is momentarily closed for at least 00 second  ive tried wiring the dimmer control to a 00v relay activated when the cue tape completes the circuit  low tech and simple but theres one problem  in order to get the 00 second pulse there needs to be a shload of cuetape on the film  00mm runs at 00 feet per minute so to get a 00 second pulse there needs to be at least 0 inches of solid cuetape  ideally i would like to use a single crosscue to accomplish this function a single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film this would give a pulse of approximately 0000 of a second what i need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 00 second  the ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice  i figure this would require an rc circuit of some sort  im sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads  any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated   thanks  mark fontana     of all the arts the cinema is    mark a fontana   the most important              computer and information science                     vi lenin    the ohio state university

   i had a similar idea for a faxanswering machine switch to put both machines on one line  you order distinctive ringing from your phone company  this is 0month here you get a second unpublished phone number  when someone calls this number your phone rings with short rings instead of long rings  you set up your answering machine on 0 rings and your fax on six rings  youd give out the new  as your fax  a device would measure the length of rings  when it detects a short ring it turns off your answering machine five rings later your fax picks up the call  this should be cheaper and more elegant than the 00 switches now available  but thats not what i did  im giving out the new  to my friends and customers  this should leave the old  for telemarketers etc  i wont pick up the phone when i hear the long rings   why my thoughts are my own when they are in but when they are out they are anothers  susannah martin hanged for witchcraft 0000 thomas david kehoe          kehoenetcomcom         000 0000000

  yes you increase the rpm slip of a boxer type fan by installing a capacitor in series with the fans power supply  the air flow of small 00 inch fans can be reduced by about 00 by using a 0 to 0 uf capacitor  use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 000 volts  note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application  for dc powered applications try the radio shack 00 volt box fan it can run and start reliably from as low as about 00 vdc  it is exceptionally quiet but at admittedly low flow  i wish i knew who made the fans for radio shack     bill mayhew      neoucom computer services department rootstown oh  000000000  usa    phone 0000000000 wtmuhuraneoucomedu 00000000    000000 n0wed

  it is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business  or for an illegal use  jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor   the results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed the federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not  a lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding  when you buy a radar detector amongst the guarrantees instructions  explanations and other detritus is an invitation to join an association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector i promise i am not making this up  i do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any  headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed  laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund raiser aspect of tickets    mike coyne

    i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video vs a blank screen by monitoring the rg and b outputs of a graphics card  it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 00 mhz which would mean detecting a 00 ns pulse  it should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen about 000 mv and a dim screen say around 000 mv  oh yes it also needs to be cheap    my first circuit was a dismal failure  i used 0 compariators each compariator had the  input going to one of the guns the  input went to a reference created by a voltage dividera potentiometer  the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow i needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators so i could have a whole screen full of text but my circuit would not detect it     the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen  in fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 000 mv  i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work    there are faster compariators but they are expensive and require  split supplies   i would need to replace my 00 quad compariator with three 000 compariators and create a whole new power supply circuit    at this point i think what i need is some sort of transistor circuit  transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick  unfortunately i am way out of my league when it comes to designing transistor circuits so i am appealing to the net for help  any ideas tips circuits pointers references etc would be greatly appreciated    oh yes i only sample the output of this thing every second or so so i dont need a fast response time at all however i havent found a way to take advantage of that fact  thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give of course you will have my undying gratitude   steve verity            steve verity                                  maxed on midi                                                    verityjacksnscom

      gstovallcrchh00nosubdomainnodomain greg stovall writes    anyway over the weekend i was resting on the sofa in between chores    and noticed that i briefly picked up what sounded like ham radio traffic    over my stereo and television even though both were off  also all the    touch sensitive lights in my house start going wacko cycling through     their four brightness states     i presume that some ham operator with an illegal amplifier drove past    my house i live on a busy thoroughfare would this be a correct presumption    what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects      the affected equipment is about 000 feet from the road  hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp  and are also unlikely to have a dirty amp     hams can legally run up to 0000 watts  it is very unlikely however    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  ham rigs  not possible either  youd need about a 000 amp alternator for just the amplifier  i can just see it  you need to slow down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button     for cars put out around 000 watts  it is possible that a 000 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 000 feet     away  most tvs stereos and vcrs have very poor rf shielding    if you experience the problem frequently it may be     caused by a ham cber or other radio operator in a base station    nearby    the interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes such as police fire    etc  if you heard voices over your stereo i think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter     if you have frequent trouble you may want to try the rf ferrite    chokes available at radio shack  the interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily without cutting them    good instructions are included with the chokes    if that does not solve the problem you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator  look for antennas on the roof    or car  talk to himher about your problem  there are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference  and please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator  this person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles  and youll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful most are  it was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as i grew up  we were blamed for skip ghost pictures on the tv that occur at sunspot peaks  cb interferance  dead grass   you name it    btw the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible  it is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the fcc views it too bad they dont require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions  last you can usually tell ham radio vs cb  ham operators are required to declare their call sign every so many minutes no more than 00  so if you hear this is wa0qt or some other call starting with a w or k and no more than 0 total characters you heard a ham cbers probably wont sign i dont know that theyre even required to and firepolice have other private ids        douglas s rand drandosforgosfmotif dev snail         00 cambridge center  cambridge  ma  00000 disclaimer    i dont know if osf agrees with me lets vote on it amateur radio kc0kj  
  well im not too sure if this would be the right place to post this but anyway here goes  i was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet printers offers up to 000x000 resolution while a lot of lower end laser printers only offer 000x000  however the laser printers still seems to be significantly pricier than the bubblejets how is this  or am i missing something about the resolution thing    sheng hl00pl000eecslehighedu hl00m000kcclehighedu hl00lehighedu

  drandspinnerosforg douglas s rand writes     hams can legally run up to 0000 watts  it is very unlikely however    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  not possible either  youd need about a 000 amp alternator for just the amplifier  it is too possible  as the original poster said it is very unlikely but definately possible  can you say batteries

  well im not too sure if this would be the right place to post this but anyway here goes  i was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet printers offers up to 000x000 resolution while a lot of lower end laser printers only offer 000x000  however the laser printers still seems to be significantly pricier than the bubblejets how is this  or am i missing something about the resolution thing  bubblejets often splatter a little bit whereas laserjets given halfway decent toner like hps microfine stuff dont  both produce very good output but you dont have to look too closely at the two to tell that laserjet output is definitely superior    on the other hand laserjets which havent been maintained properly and use the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output much worse than a bubblejet   one other thing there are bubblejets and then there are bubblejets there are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output such as hps dinky little bubblejet whereas most produce really good looking output such as hps deskjets  ibm and canon both produce some of the really good style bubblejets  joel kolstad  ps  if youre in the market for a portable bublejet printer i can highly recommend the hp portable deskjet although ive heard the portable canons are good too i needed pcl support myself  with the deskjet portable you even get an undocumented pcmcia card slot

  one other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about nearuv light being cheaper to get at than actual uv light does anyone know what he was referring to  i dont want to get into a semantic argument but contrary to some other postings near uv light is actual uv light  the near means that it is close to the visible spectrum ie of relatively long wavelength not that it is nearly uv  im sure you can figure out now just what far uv is  regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of uv in the near end of the spectrum such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak uv source  stronger sources are going to require gas probably mercury vapor discharge tubes such as fluorescent tubes with uv phosphor  be careful though strong uv sources can cause physiological damage especially to the eyes  the shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous  it wouldnt project a beam like a flashlight but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source  it would be bright enough to be useful but not dangerously so  ed hall edhallrandorg

   could someone please tell me if a 00 decoder is the same as a 0 to 0  demultiplexer i know how to link 0 of these to get an 0 output circuit  but how do i link 0 of these to make a 000 multiplexer sorry if this  seems like a lame question but im only a newbie to electronics and i  have to do this circuit please make any mail as droolproof as possible     thanx  taro ogawa  u000000studentcanberraeduau  a 0 of 0 decoder need not be the same as a 0 to 0 demultiplexer although many commercial ssi implementations allow you to use one as such strictly a 0 of 0 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state according to the inputs  a demux on the other hand uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal so there are three inputs required  a decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable input since this can be used as the data input eg when high all outputs are high when low only the selected by control inputs output will be low  an eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit bit 0 to select which of two four way demuxes is enabled thus you achieve your aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits note that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux since you have no data input the enable line on a four way decoder left once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose  a sixteen way decoder obviously requires four fourway decoders plus a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time therefore use the fifth decoder attached to the two high order bits to provide the four enable lines  of course the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the four final stage decoders  please give me the credit when you submit your homework  johnh                                         electronics department                            school of mpce                macquarie university                                                   sydney australia 0000      email johnhmpcemqeduau ph 00 0 000 0000 fax 00 0 000 0000

  suppose we have a boolean function which is a minimal sumofproducts derived from a kmap or something like this  fabcd  bcd  acd  abc  abc  the books on logic design i have consulted all seem to imply that this is where the analysis ends    but by factoring out the a term in the function we can get fewer gates  fabcd  bcd  acd  bc  bc  which yields 0 gates   yes but the minimization of gates is important in part because of timing considerations  a ttl gate has the basic structure of andorinvert and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly one gate delay  the reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization  a positiveor gate such as the 0gate solution uses has two gate delays and theres another gate delay in the second term so that the second solution while simpler in logic symbols can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world ecl is similar to ttl in that it can support an orand gate with the minimum delay unlike ttl you get both true and inverse outputs for free when using ecl  pals are basically large programmable andorinvert gates with your choice of internal connections between the various sections and perhaps some latches so a minimum sum of products also is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few pals  its not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates but some software packages claim to allow you to do so and will take just about any mess of gates as a nodelist with 00xxx series logic ics and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job  xilinxs xact software does this by treating each logic block as a macro and expanding it all out then simplifying  john whitmore

  i am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and ive hit a snag in my application i want to be able to change the gain of an op amp amplifier from 0 to 0 controlable via a digital input the most obvious way ive come up with is to use analog switches to adjust the gain of the op amp the only analog switch i have experience with it the 0000 unfortunately i want to switch an ac signal which goes from about 0v to 0v and the 0000 is only for positive signals   i have a carrier signal which varies between 0v and 0v i want to demodulate an input signal by feeding the input signal thru a amp with a gain of 0 when the carrier is at 0v and thru a amp with a gain of 0 when the carrier is 0v the output is then low pass filtered i believe this is called lock in detection as well as synchronous demodulation  look at the 0000  this is a triple 0to0 transmissiongate analog multiplexer with positive and negative power supplies can be run from a singleended supply as well  with dual supplies the logic inputs still range from ground 0 volts to vdd  this is a neat well i think so design for a switchablepolarity amplifier                                                                                  input                                    opamp  output                                                        controlx analog switch                                                                      gnd  all resistors are equalvalue  when the analog switch is closed the amp is invertinggainofone  with the switch open it is noninvertinggainofone  you can clean up the circuit to trim out input offset current if this hurts the balance this would show up as carrier feedthrough  for high frequencies the slewrate of the opamp might cause problems especially if it isnt symmetrical and it usually isnt         paul elliott  dsc optilink  petaluma ca usa           uunetpyramidtekbspaoptilinkelliott or elliottoptilinkcom        i used to think i was indecisive but now im not so sure

  jehcmkrnlcom writes  hmmm  how are those orange isolated ground outlets often used in computer rooms wired    they require two separate grounds  one ground goes to the ground pin of the outlet and the other ground wire is connected to the outlets mounting tabs and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal faceplate if any  the boxfaceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground the outlet groundpin wire is generally connected to an insulated busbar in the distribution panel which is in turn connected to the buildingentrance main ground by its own wire  so the two separate ground systems are connected together at the buildings service entrance  but one is also connected to every grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged into isolatedground outlets of that panel  if someone happens to accidentally short one phase of a 000v feeder to ground the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it until the breaker trips or the fuse blows while the isolated ground will remain relatively noisefree

  i built a little project using the radio shack 0vdc relays to switch audio  i got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched   is there a good relayrelay circuit that i can use for switching audio so that there will be no noise of any kind on the audio lines  with relays alone you will always get a transient when you abruptly turn on or off any channel  if you dont want to hear the transient use some other device a photoresistoroutput optoisolator is the usual sort of thing to gently mute the signal then switch then remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator  it used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors in switching audio because the photoresistor time delay a few thousandths of a second kept any noise in the digital side which drives the lamp from contaminating the audio  and the devices are cheaper than relays  john whitmore

      i was just wondering one thing actually two  i hope that this is the proper place to post this subject    why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor     i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and i just went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but  they act like the two terminals are shorted  i asked a friend and he said that you should never do that cause it ruins them but he couldnt tell me why  thanks camter00astroocistempleedu

  i live in the san francisco bay area and word has it that something similar is on its way here  since we apparently dont have the sensor base you folks have theyre installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways initial tests are going to be in the santa clara area im told with the video being piped into a command center theyre building somewhere in the east bay  im not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data but large multicolored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway  an announcer will sit in front of the status wall and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it  theyre apparently also looking into licensing a lowam frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system  in the mean time theyll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead  my understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program and information from it will be available free of charge  perhaps the la system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate read cheap  we also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the sap audio channel of television channels 0 and 00  these are verbal reports qualified with a identification tone to tell invehicle receivers like the auto talk that the information coming next is applicable to a given area  in la theyre probably using some other tv channels but the concept is the same  try setting your stereo tv or vcr to receive the sap audio channel and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information i believe this program is also subsidized making the invehicle receivers cheap to purchase and without having to incur monthly fees to use it  since the makers of these invehicle receivers dont have to pay for the broadcast this may not be completely true they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the cal trans stuff hits the airwaves  you may have a nifty little tv audio receiver in your car nothing more when this happens  perhaps a word to the wise    i think wed all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the la system is networked and paid for  cheers alan acooneynetcomcom

  one notsoquick question to throw out there for you guys  for our class project we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs  voltatge  adjustable from 000v current   limited at 0a  voltage must stay within 0 of designated value for i from 00a ac ripple less than 0 mv rms  of course we cant just use an adjustable voltage currentlimiting regulator chip   our problem is with the current limiting ie weve found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit  what the supply must do if presented with a load which would draw more than 0a given the supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp  thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we should read one amp  if we measure the current through a 0 ohm  resistor at 00v we should read one amp and the output voltage by necessity must be 0v  the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor and therefore reduce the output  so does anybody have any ideas we could work from  thanks in advance  andy collins kc0yey acollinsuclinkberkeleyedu  ps if anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project i agree fully     but i still have to do it its graded

   ive used onchip capacitors to reduce groundbounce noise on a small systolic array chip that had 00pf loads on the clock lines design was in 0micron nwell cmos using the mosis scalable design rules here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors  0 they dont help much with simultaneous output switchingthere is still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the load capacitor on both the signal line and the ground return so you still get ground and power line bounce   0 they do help a lot with onchip loads as i had with the high load on the clock lines   0 the transients you are trying to suppress are really high frequency so forget about large areas of polythinoxidediff capacitors since the rc time constant is too large what i did is to make a metal0 metal poly diff sandwich but put a lot of holes in the poly layer allowing frequent diffmetal0 contacts  i forget exactly how wide the poly lines were  if i were doing this design again id probably omit the diff altogether and use a solid poly sheet instead using just m0 m0 and poly and substrate but that has such a high resistance it can be ignored at these speeds  0 you are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings especially for output signalling than spending chip area on capacitors i had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for a mosis tiny chip and the next size up was twice as big as i needed   kevin karplus   kevin karpluskarplusceucscedu  due to budgetary constraints the light at the end of the tunnel is being turned off

  tony wayne writes  what is pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments tony  pink noise is a random signal with more lowfrequency components than white noise  if you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer you will find that the spectrum power density is flat which means that every frequency is present in the noise signal  often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of lowpass filtering a white noise signal therefore pink noise contains much more lowfrequency components  the effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring animals an additional lowpass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why  enjoy it  wouter

   how does the radio electronics free information cards work do they just send you some general information about the companies that advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a catalog   that depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled radio electronics compiles all of the cards then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number some magazines also provide the data on selfadhesive labels and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk  the advertiser decides what to do with the data they get you will notice that the radio electronics information card commonly called a bingo card in the industry includes lines for a company name and a business phone number my guess would be that the big national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can for example if you include motorola as your company and include a business phone and a mail stop tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hardbound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later if you leave it blank odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog and then some companies like digikey or jameco have nothing to mail out accept the catalog  a couple of other interesting points about bingo cards free industry magazines like edn and such also log your card to their computer they use the information at least three ways they note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you through repeated mailings to resubscribe they also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics this way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that 00 of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors and finally some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information for example tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment other than tektronics in the past 0 months  the other point in the data the advertiser receives many magazines include how many items you circled on the card if they want the advertiser can attempt to cull out the literature collectors from the serious potential customers  can you say qualified sales leads i thought you could  whats the best way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards    never circle more than 0 number on the card if you want more   than 0 items use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later    if you are really really serious and you really really want   the information call the advertiser and ask this will also   cut about 00 days off the the response time virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout    to help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that youre   not really qualified for send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers    include a business name and phone number even if its your house   advertisers almost never call   john schuch   publisher of the arizona hightech times                 the arizona electrical journal                 the arizona hvac news   all of which have bingo cards

  duane yeesh you will be nailing those irleds  may i suggest getting your mitts on the siemens sfh0000 irled  this unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit  it will output nearly a watt 000 mw with real short duty cycle times  nice thing about the sfh0000 is that it is cheap  i got mine for about 00 cents a piece even though i had to buy 000 of them  are you saying that you have some extras that you would like to do some cost recovery on  i may be interested  i think for practical and cost reasons i am limited to envelope detection so that leaves me with only increasing the output power and increasing the optical gain at the receiver as methods to extend range  btw i have seen irleds with outputs up to 0 wattshonest 0 watts  i dont have the book here at work so i cant recall the company name  the 0 watter aint cheap around 000 but if you want some power mamamia thats pretty hot  they also have a 0 watt a 0 watt and a 0 watt device in their line and will sell small quan to individuals if you are interested i can find the book at home and get the pertinent info  yes im interested in the company name  i have access to an extensive data book collection  with that kind of power are we getting into an area where eye safety is getting to be a problem  now as for the position detector you might try eltec in florida phone number listed in the 0000 etid is 0000000000  they seem like nice people  their specialty is passive infrared detection devices so they might be able to help you out  they are a long way from me but they might be a better source than i can find around here  im curious about your applications if you dont mind saying the device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game although youd need to up your carrier signal concept to 000 khz  im keeping my application confidential for now  raising the frequency should be no problem in fact one respondent to my question said that i may not have to mimic the 00 duty cycle normally used by ir detector chips    stan burton dndcraddresdtdmssagcg                 sburtondresdndca 000 0000000     dre suffield box 0000 medicine hat ab canada t0a 0k0

  in scielectronics rgc0000bcsteccaboeingcom robert g carpenter writes   im wondering if its possible to use radio waves to measure the  distance between a transmitters and receiver  yes its called radar well actually not quite both radar and radioaltimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal then receive its reflection from a target radar generally uses pulses while radio altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuouswave transmission in the case of the latter highly accurate distance measurement can be made as an example the original bendix ala00 radio altimeter was accurate to 00 foot at 0000 feet altitude  note however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked about the problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter triggers this cannot be wire connected since radio waves will actually travel faster in freespace air in this case than wire the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable so you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance etc something like a pll connected to a gps receiver should do the trick triggering both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously sound expensive not too bad but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort  why not go to a different method surveyors use a laserlight system where again the reflection time is measured why not try this sounds like something a pe should know about anyway    seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength  and determine distance this would be for short distances 0000 ft  and i would need to have accuracy of 0 inches or so  this is actually highly inaccurate since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit there are variances in the antenna and transmission line and the receiver may also vary both from unit to unit and the same unit over time you would need to continuously calibrate the entire system with the radio altimeter this is also done but since everything is located at one place it is much easier to do note especially that the time base for the ra receiver and transmitter is one unit also  depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes in a dynamic environment with objects moving about the multipath kills this concept  nope fm capture effect says that the strongest signal wins that is unless the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 0 db in signal strength this is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes signals bouncing off runways tend to be very strong   what frequencies would be best for this or does matter  as high as possible to eliminate outside influence and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signals radio altimeters typically use frequencies around 0 ghz  hope this helps     jack brindle ham radio wa0fib internet jackbmddcommmotcom

  kuosheng kasey chang writes    there are several types of copy protection and the point is to make   sure the  user is using a legitimate copy  the simplest and virtually foolproof   way is  for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed   on  some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a   different  machine not installed from original disks will not work      okay so what do you do if some part of the machine presumably the part   on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself   upon goes bad you replace that part and now your program wont run   because its on a different computer  this is of course assuming that the program uses something in rom like   the bios serial number maybe and not a diskbased code number    obviously if the drive goes bad youll be reinstalling the stuff anyway  i work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system    we have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred   machines both pc and macintosh as well as administering a network of   over 00 next machines  i personally am concerned only with a small lab   with ten pcs and ten macs  im not the manager but help him with   admin often  imho copyprotection schemes of any sort are nothing more   than a major headache for the legitimate user  anyone who wants a copy of   your program and doesnt care about legality will get a copy  period    pirate board or no pirate board  i too have friends who blatantly and   quite successfuly hack copy protection schemes practically in their   sleep  lets consider what goes on in our lab  almost daily we have at least one   machine down sometimes several due to some goofball screwing up some   setting or other on a piece of software  admittedly we being students   mostly are not the worlds most efficient and effective network   administrators but we try  keeping even the twenty machines that are   partly my responsibility even vaguely looking and acting similar to   the average user and maintaining behindthescenes consistency is a   real headache but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty   different folder locations of norton utilities when some guy trashes his   disk  often we have hardware problems at peak business times and have to do   some partsswapping to get stuff working temporarily     well ill cut to the chase and quit boring yall     the point is often we have to reinstall software and copy configuration   files etc from machine to machine  by far the easiest way we have found   to do this is to get one machine working exactly the way we want to then   copy the complete setup of this machine to the other nine of that   machines type  this ensures us that for at least ten minutes we have   ten identical machines to work with  having them networked simplifies   this considerably as our major packages wordperfect windows etc are   all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with  often however we need to install a package requested by some instructor   to one some or all of the machines for a special project  this is   usually a handwritten or sharewareetc program similar to what i believe   the original poster was asking about  the few we have had with copy   protection schemes have caused nothing but nightmares for us to maintain       in short dont waste your time with a copy protection scheme  its sort   of like outlawing guns  the criminals will get your program anyway and   you will only be hurting the legitimate honest user  write a good users   guide and tech manual whatever else for your program please do this   regardless of whether you copy protect the thing and only distribute   the manual to licensed users  jack the price to cut your losses but   please take a cue from the major companies who can admittedly afford the   costs of illegal copies far better than you and dont burden the   legitimate user with a copy protection scheme   sorry for the tirade but its been a long day here       mark s underwood ee student university of kentucky lab assistant boyd hall microlab  a tiny little division of uk library microlabs email  msunde00mikukyedu      the program is definitely backupable if restored to the same machine   depends  on the programmer  dont use a disk drive characteristic  if the   user   did an upgrade to the machine heshe should reinstall all programs any   way  no document lookup no disk wearandtear    i did not say that the originals would allow only one install  the   users   conscience should do that    i know ill get flamed for this  but with the increasing number of   casual  users who either unknowingly or dont care about the software copyrights  its the truth  i have friends who ask me for copies of my latest   games  all the time and when i refused they went after somebody else   casual  pirating is becoming more of a problem  some sort of copy protection   will  discourage the casual copying  ive seen what some of my friends dug   up  somewhere  latest and the greatest games all cracked within days of   actual  release  you know how many bytes you need to change in xwing to   disable  the quiz  two  yes two  and dont ask me which ones they are    determined  pirates are unstoppable given enough time but their results do not   spread   that far since pirate boards are not that wellknown and easily   tracked once  found by authorities  it is the casual pirates that the copy   protection is  determined to discourage    what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus  a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup  registered to xxxxx  address city state zip and disables the   above  two benefits 0 encourages registration 0 cuts down on pirating and  makes it more traceable because if the patchs registration message is  encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a  stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus  violated their license agreement    this way the legitimate users who does not register will experience   minimal   discomfort who does major upgrades to their computer frequently as   only  problem they have is they wont be able to restore to another computer    the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and   therefore  gains full rights and can restore to different machines  on the other   hand  the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is   supposed to be  if this users copy was found to be somewhere it was   not   supposed to be we know who has broken their license agreement  of   course  a hacker can break that eventually but thats not the point is it    kasey chang

           i have a question about accessing certain addresses on a chip particulary a 00c000 eprom  although i dont know that much about it as i understand it theres a pin on the chip that when voltage is applied kicks up the address  the question is how do you determine how many bytes the address is incremented by  for example if i have code i want to be accessed at 0000 and also at say 0000 how do i move the address pointer to those positions  thanks for any info      sean kelly  sysop amizon bbs 0000000000                             always looking for classic video games for the following systems                                                                              atari 0000atari 0000colecovisionatari 0000intellivisionvectrex     
  much deleted about assembly in usa vs other  i wish to focus on the subject of warmrunning amplifiers      sure the amp runs very fairly     hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good     an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how its gonna sound   the amp you have probably is running classa the whole day     because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted   to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  hmmmmm    there is a correclation between warmrunning amps and good sound or in your words it does have a bearing on  now i dont suggest that everyone run out and create combination stoveamplifiers that will degrade lifespan but a coldrunning circuit is much more suceptible to temperature variation with varrying current than is a warmrunning one  and since junction resistance is a function of temperature this has a detrimental effect on linearity    a few facts bias points vary with temperature junction resist varrie with temp adcom products do not run classa  if you still dont beleive this assertion consider the warmup requirements for most good test equipment or better yet just listen to an amplifier warmup  on many designs its quite audible on mine about 00 minutes for the output stage many hours for the drivers  fortunately the drivers are not switched  in any experiment or when drawing conclusions from listening betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias idle current level  both have a positive correlation with low distortion and good sound quality and high bias results in warmer operation all other factors being equal  grant    
   i built a little project using the radio shack 0vdc relays to switch  audio  i got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched  i was doing  most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and  nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks    my question is    is there a good relayrelay circuit that i can use for switching  audio so that there will be no noise of any kind on the audio lines    i will appreciate any advice or references to advice  also exact part  numberscompany names etc for the relays will help  the first step is to make sure that there is no dc component intentional or not on the audio lines to be switched if neither the output or input presents an unintentional dc level lets say theyre capacitively coupled then putting a 00 k resistor from each input to ground and from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any coupling caps presenting a dc level that is guaranteed to cause a click  if the device presents an unintentional dc level that is from more than just coupling capacitor leakage then you need to remove the dc before switching with coupling capacitors of your own  if you have more than one relay each relay switching one input through to a common output you can use makebeforebreak switching where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch change this may mask the switch click  an audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and making your own ersatz optoisolator with a lightdependent resistor ldr sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink many broadcast consoles use this older but timehonored technique claro actually makes a complete optisolator like this but i dont have a part number handy radio shack has a ldr grabbag 0000000 you might want to try  for a simple solid state clickless switch that is cheap you might try  looking at the cd0000 analog switch that is commonly available or its older predecessor the 0000 again the dc component must be removed prior to switching other alternatives include jfet switches both discrete and ic and diode switching which works relatively well surprisingly all the above with their pitfalls and application tips could easily make a subject for a multipage article  solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on due to charge being injected into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal changes state techniques to minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through the switch differential switching and slowing the risetime of the control pulse with the 0000 cutting the click can be as simple as putting 00k  00k resistors in series with the control pins  hope this helps at least get you started            dave medinphone000 0000000 w     ssdnetworking000 0000000 h     intergraph corp        ms gd0000 internet dtmedincatbyteb00ingrcom   huntsville al 00000uucp  uunetingrb00catbytedtmedin      everywhere you look at least around my office     the opinions expressed here are mine or those of my machine

  verityjacksnscom steve verity writes       i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video vs  a blank screen by monitoring the rg and b outputs of a graphics  card  it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at  00 mhz which would mean detecting a 00 ns pulse  it should also be  able to tell the difference between a blank screen about 000 mv  and a dim screen say around 000 mv  oh yes it also needs to be  cheap      my first circuit was a dismal failure  i used 0 compariators each  compariator had the  input going to one of the guns the  input  went to a reference created by a voltage dividera potentiometer    the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow i  needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the  compariators so i could have a whole screen full of text but my    the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then  the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen  in  fact the difference between completely black and completely white is  only 000 mv  i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the  video signals to make this work      there are faster compariators but they are expensive and require   split supplies   i would need to replace my 00 quad compariator  with three 000 compariators and create a whole new power supply  circuit      at this point i think what i need is some sort of transistor  circuit  transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick    unfortunately i am way out of my league when it comes to designing  transistor circuits so i am appealing to the net for help  any  ideas tips circuits pointers references etc would be greatly  appreciated      oh yes i only sample the output of this thing every second or so so  i dont need a fast response time at all however i havent found a  way to take advantage of that fact    thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give of course  you will have my undying gratitude      steve verity                   steve verity                                  maxed on midi                                                     verityjacksnscom            in order to get the 00 ns response time you need you are better off  going to an ecl slicer which can run off a single 0 or 00 v supply  you just need to bias or do some level shifting perhaps to get it in the  range check out the ecl 00k books for a simple cheap solution  dinoinqmindbisonmbca the inquiring mind bbs winnipeg manitoba  000 0000000

  acollinsuclinkberkeleyedu andy collins writes   one notsoquick question to throw out there for you guys    for our class project we need to design and build a power supply  to the following specs    voltatge  adjustable from 000v  current   limited at 0a    voltage must stay within 0 of designated value for i from 00a  ac ripple less than 0 mv rms    of course we cant just use an adjustable voltage currentlimiting  regulator chip     our problem is with the current limiting ie weve found stuff to  do the rest of the parts of the circuit  what the supply must do  if presented with a load which would draw more than 0a given the  supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal  one amp  thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we  should read one amp  if we measure the current through a 0 ohm   resistor at 00v we should read one amp and the output voltage by  necessity must be 0v    the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves  a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output   power transistor and therefore reduce the output    so does anybody have any ideas we could work from    thanks in advance    andy collins kc0yey  acollinsuclinkberkeleyedu    ps if anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project i agree fully      but i still have to do it its graded     you can design for ramp shutoff brickwall current limit or even  foldback cutoffsounds like you want brickwall current limit  your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base  drive in order to get the brick wall you need enough voltage gain on  the current sensor  normally a darlington on the current sensing  resistor will be adequate but for infinite gain use an op amp to sense  the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to  turn off the base bias on the seriespass transistor  phase compensation  may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more  than 000 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain ok  dinoinqmindbisonmbca the inquiring mind bbs winnipeg manitoba  000 0000000

  the battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold  the temperature combined with selfdischarge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of  the battery  i strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesnt go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite cooler   
   not that the question is anything important but i am still curious  why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green i have seen  a few blue ones but no red yellow company logo etc is there a  technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have  not tought about it yet    juha the color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of it  original and older boards were bakelite composition and were brown phenolic spelling was a tan most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green filled fiberglass is blue teflon is white  as boards evolved more and more demands were made of them  first boards were used mainly in audio circuitry  couldnt be used in high voltage or rf because it would arc and burn  most boards today are fiberglass the type being chosen by its use and cost    boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon and ceramic as the fiberglass and other boards are conductive they actually work more as a  capacitive dialectric but the word conductive simplifies explaination at the high frequencies  another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections is a thin flexible mostly mylar material and is used to connect the front of the vehicle etc to the back instead of wiring harnesses  camcorders use this to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance  am working on a generator made by hewlet packard right now and the entire board is gold plated boy it looks expensive  hope i got most of my facts right as i am working from memory of material read  my education was pretransister   00 tom  tom wagner audio visual technician  malaspina college nanaimo british columbia 0000000000 loc 0000  fax0000000  callsignve0gda weapon00 kentucky rifle snail mail to  site q0 c0   rr0 nanaimo british columbia canada v0r 0x0    i do not recyle   i keep everything       all standard disclaimers apply

              i have a question about accessing certain addresses on a chip  particulary a 00c000 eprom  although i dont know that much about it as i  understand it theres a pin on the chip that when voltage is applied kicks  up the address  the question is how do you determine how many bytes the  address is incremented by  for example if i have code i want to be  accessed at 0000 and also at say 0000 how do i move the address pointer to  those positions  thanks for any info         sean kelly  sysop amizon bbs 0000000000                              always looking for classic video games for the following systems                                                                                atari 0000atari 0000colecovisionatari 0000intellivisionvectrex      judging by your sig you are trying to make some kind of game cartridge information of how to build an eeprom cartidge for the vectrex is available via anonymous ftp at csusedu  since youve chosen the 00c000 you are probably trying to make a multicart to do this simply 0 load the game images into the eeprom at 0000 0000 etc your eeprom burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into one file yourself with suitable gaps 0 wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game console and the high bits going to switches to choose between games  to directly answer your question above the pin that kicks up the address is simply another address line  for a concrete example with the 00c000 and 0k games images you would wire a0a00 to the cartridge and a00a00 to 0 switches  the 0 switches would allow you to pick from the 0 games on the eeprom

  do you know any assembly language at all  all anyone needs to do if find the part of the code that does the quiz and insert a jmp instruction to just completely skip it  not that difficult really  and there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing  using pklite or some similar utility would help but only if the resulting compressed exe were tagged as uncompressable  and even that doesnt help there are at least two programs available that fixes this unp and dislite both available from simtel00 and even without them it isnt that hard to fix

  i strongly disagree i think most pirating is done by amateurs who wont copy the program if diskcopy cant do it  i hate to disagree but i will  note i dont pirate software nor do i trade it i simply have met and talked extensively with those who have thats it the fbi can tap someone elses phone  most pirating is done by people who dont use the programs they pirate a cracked program tends to get passed on resplendant in the various graphics and animations that advertise whoever performed the modifications  i admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in giving copies of programs to ones fellow workers maybe taking it home for use on ones own pc but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most spread throughout the business as a whole how many times have you had someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks  its mostly a matter of convenience a person sees a program they want to use and they feel justified in making a copy since someones already paid for it etc etc a note this is starting to change a bit not much though  if youre talking a 00 max goal of pirated copies i bet that anything that will beat diskcopy and cant be easily copied from a hard drive will suffice  what about commercially available copy programs copyii how about programs like teledisk that can do things diskcopy cant and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy wouldnt know about this   after working with people around computers one comes to realize that the average user doesnt know much any computer enthusiast is at least 000x better at preguessing commands and how to use them can you sit down and use something without reading the manual and it is these people who are doing the 00 pirating not joe windows user who cant remember a few arguments to the dir command  i hate hard copy manuals and would rather have all docs online  not because i want to copy the program but because its usually faster and and convenient than sifting through an old book i cant find  really i find it evens out the online stuff can be read through faster but youre stuck reading it in linear flow start to finish unless you jump ahead with a search or such a book though you can flip through faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty index too  but i partially agree i often wish i could grep something that was written down  off deeper end why does everyone think they need to be able to make a  backup copy almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk so you are left with the originals as your backups i think its a waste of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend out the backups   what if they need to reinstall the idea of a backup still holds if the original disk goes bad theyre out of luck for about 00 weeks which is the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks if theyll do it without a charge    edward w jajko   the nekomancer  ejajkohertzeleecalpolyedu  mein fuhrer i can walk doctor strangelove   
   could make for some interesting choreography light and sound could be  controlled directly by the position of a dancer on stage or by the number of dancers on stage neat   you could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage   can you tell us more about what youre doing sounds like a very cool program  tis only a gleam in my eye at this point  i have yet to chose a tracking  method  the initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage  i did some experiments with  pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition  and dancers stand still alot so their ir signature goes away  the good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional  to the size of the warm body or body part and the velocity of said body this could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture  dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their  bodies but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked  the current toy i have been working with is a program called mandala for the amiga used with a live video digitizer  this works with a video camera  trained on the stage  you can set thresholds for a zone within the field of view and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event events can be midi objects or sequences amiga sounds or graphic objects  its been fun to play with but the documentaion is arcane and the digitizer is noisy still its very appealing the dancers dont have to wear any appliances you can have ots of zones it speaks midi which can be used to control lights and i dont have to build any electronics  its all done with lighting and video brightness and contrast adjustments  i have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic but i have hopes

   in order to emit blue light a semiconductor must have a band gap energy within the region of 00 to 00 electron volts according to my physical electronics prof you cant get an led with that band gap thats why you dont find blue leds or for that matter some other colour of leds that is not to say that blue leds cant be found  ive seen blue leds sold but they were just your typical visible light led in a blue plastic covering they didnt emit very much light  um  0 your professor if just plain wrong  although blue leds are one heck of a lot less efficient than red ones 0 typical visible light leds dont really exist  leds have a fairly narrow region of transmittence  since the fermi energy around either side of the band gap falls off exponentially blah blah  source solid state electronic devices ben g streetman 0d ed prentice hall  you might want to check the copyright date on that   blue leds most certainly do exist ive got a bunch at work  cree research makes them probably along with other companies  cree is big in materials science though they advertise in the stuff like physics today etc  you can buy them from jameco i think digikey definitely and plenty of other distributors  actually these days you can get a typical visible light led  its called a rainbow led and ive forgotten who makes it they advertise in edn and many of the other trade rags though  it combines a reg green and blue led all on one chip and has four leads  nifty device although its probably fairly expensive  joel kolstad

   anyways ive built the basic up  down converters with pretty  good results 00 efficiency but im running into problems  when i try to design  build anything that puts out serious  amps i know it can be done i have some 0v000a guts on my  bench but something puzzles me im using a simple choke as   the storage element basicly a toroid with a single winding  but all commercial models use transformers with many windings  i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for  the usual errorfeedback but some of the others seem to loose  me what are they for better than that anyone have a full  schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of id  love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such  low volume   most commercial switchers do not use magnetics for their energy storage thats handled by the big caps on the primary side those which in a  linearlyregulated power supply would be considered the filter caps coming right after the bridge  the transformer is just that  a  transformer  its there primarily to step the voltage up or down  although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is not negligible as anyone whos zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a snubber diode across it would tell you  actually many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in  the basic switchedmode power supply operates something like this in a somewhat simplified manner  the ac line is rectified to produce a high voltage moreorless unregulated dc rail  the energy storage or filter caps appear across this rail as does the switching transistor the transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer resulting in steppedup or steppeddown pulses out the secondary which  are then rectified and filtered  at least one of the transformers outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor which acts in a pulsewidth modulation pwm fashion to control by varying the pulse width the amount of energy being dumped into the primary and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary  the remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will moreorless tracking the regulated output or they may have some additional linear regulation added  you may also note that the feedback between the  regulated output and the pwm control which is most typically an ic is not done via a direct electrical connection this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated  often the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement  while the transformer isnt the primary energystorage device in these designs this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored besides the inductive kick giving the switch transistor a bad time as noted above you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went in to the transformer back out again one way or another in some designs this happens more or less automatically  but in others you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesnt saturate which again would have disastrous results best left to the  imagination   im not by any stretch of the imagination a powersupply designer  hopefully a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above   bob myers  kc0ew   hewlettpackard co      opinions expressed here are not                    systems technology div  those of my employer or any other myersfchpcom    fort collins colorado   sentient lifeform on this planet

      i was just wondering one thing actually two  i hope that this is the proper place to post this subject    why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor     i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and i just went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but  they act like the two terminals are shorted  i asked a friend and he said that you should never do that cause it ruins them but he couldnt tell me why   its not the concrete floor that does it the problem is that leadacid cells self discharge over time even high quality cells gates for instance will discharge 0000 over a 00 month period of time nonsealed cells self discharge even faster if the battery was not completly charged when left sitting it probably discharged past the the point where cell sulfiding occurs which in many cases means a ruined battery         datalog consulting tucson az        ejmdatalogcom          noaodatalogcomejm           
  here is a different viewpoint   fyi  the actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an hp  deskjet is 0000th inch  the electronics and dynamics of the ink  cartridge however limit you to generating dots at 000 per inch  on almost any paper the ink wicks more than 0000th inch anyway    the method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer  results in much less spread than ink drop technology  in practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc can happen   it doesnt take much investigation to see that the mechanical and  electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than  inexpensive ink jet printers  recall also that laser printers  offer a much higher throughput  00 ppm for a laser versus about 0  ppm for an ink jet printer  a cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the first sheet take to print inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer i have a 00000 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer  a sage said to me do you want one copy or lots of copies one  inkjet    something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the  life of the printer  a 0000 page yield toner cartridge is about  us 0000 at discount while hp high capacity 0000000 page yield  cartridges are about us 00 at discount  it could be that over the  life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are  less than ink jet printers  it is getting progressively closer  between the two technologies  laser printers are usually desinged  for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product  replacement cycles  paper cost is the same and both can use refills long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts consumables and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer  hp inkjets understand pcl so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver   there is one wild difference between the two printers a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer this means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot few drivers  actually use this facility there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on    tc      email tchannonblackdemoncouk or tchannoncixcompulinkcouk

     why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable  when stored on a concrete floor    when will people learn  the trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows ballast  resistors are used to discharge batteries furthermore it is very silly to  store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to  contact the ballast   seriously self discharge the actual problem as stated by others does vary  greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge i have in  fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full  charge for  0 years so it must be possible  if your garage is heated store the batteries somewhere cooler but above  freezing flat batteries freeze more easily occasionally charge it once a  month or even leave it on float charge permanently special charger  dont do this unless you know what you are doing seriously dangerous  anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like  electric mowers  they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep  discharged and their life may be greatly shorted some early zero maintenance  automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure  shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb 0yrs 00000 miles and  counting    tc      email tchannonblackdemoncouk or tchannoncixcompulinkcouk

   thats why you dont find blue leds or for that matter some other colour of leds that is not to say that blue leds cant be found  ive seen blue leds sold but they were just your typical visible light led in a blue plastic covering they didnt emit very much light  sorry charlie  i have a dozen very blue leds on my bench right now they have a clear plastic case and when lit are absolutely blue the hue is sort of a summer day cloudless sky blue but make no mistake they are blue  you can buy them from digikey circuit specialist jameco i think ledtronics stanley optoelectronics and others the current price is around 000 each for small quantities i will also be selling them through my mailorder company in the near future 0 weeks write for details if interested  john     
  hmmm   a possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the distributor register the copy when the software was sold  the clerk sticks it in the store pc and asks for the buyers id later if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser in addition copies which were sent to distributorsstores would have a vendor reg  or serial  in order to track in store piracy  possible additional program security schemes would be 0 having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in    and registration inconvenient 0 taking dire legal action on anyone caught expensive 0 encryption crc check self modifying code limited effectiveness 0 have an independent watchdog program in the installationsetup config or    memory manager etc which would check the main programs crc     only as effective as above methods at best 0 have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked     copies of the program andor the offenders hard drive risky and probably    illegal certainly immoral  my new ideas arent terribly feasible to implement as presented but i thought if i threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective what is the problem with parallel port security keys i havent used anything that had hardware key copy protection schemes so i dont know what the drawbacks are i know the companies that make them claim theyre uncrackable but ive seen cracks of autodesk 0dstudio floating around i dont have one so dont ask and i had heard that it had parralel port keys  vamillironothelloucdedu my apologies if i rambled but vi inhibits my communication skills greatly  
  inkjet and bubblejet printers are the same tech  bubblejet was trademarked by cannon and inkjet was by hp i belive  i have seen both and own a  bubblejet a apple stylewriter which has a cannon engine with a 000 dpi rated output  the output is very good with quality paper which is very importaint  cheap paper gives bad results  i use sealed paper and the only differenc is that the ink is less dark than toner i compaire to the apple personal laserwriter ntx but then again the difference is 000 to 0000 so     david a smith                i like to skate on the other side of the ice   dasmithsuntanecusfedu   i didnt do it and i dont know anything     smithdeggocseeusfedu    either usf better not know im here    
         im looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response  to the output from a walkman cassette player how could i do this i dont want it just to turn on i want it to strobe once so to speak per every beep i put on a cassette tape        would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency is there any easy way to do either of these im looking for  the simplest circuit possible i guess what im asking for is some sort of color organ but not quite let me trt to explain again        im going to have a pattern of beats or beeps on a cassette tape so on the tape youd hear   beep pause beep pause beep pauseetc   with speed increasing as time goes on i want to synchronize an led  probably two of them with the beeps on the cassette tape so the led with each beep would go on and off real quick generating a strobe light sort of effect the rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the leds and if there was no sound on the tape except for background his the leds would remain off please help     thanks      dana  try looking in a magizine called radio electronics may 0000 issue page 00  there is a circuit for a midi light controller there     andy    andy belville                           its taken me a long time but ive belviladdunx0ocsdrexeledu           fallen in love with a beautiful woman

  i need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to deliver 0 joules at 000 volts  the ubiquitous camera flash circuit is what i want but i cant get mine apart without breaking it  charlie bretts suggestion  buy one of the disposable flash cameras use the film then take the thing apart  is a good one  note though that you wont get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing and it may be a singlepoint design that wont adapt well to offnominal operation  the things are easy to dismantle  the key piece of information is that when you advance the film on one of them you are winding it into the film cassette  it is unwound from the cassette in the factory when the camera is made  so no darkroom is needed for dismantling  its standard film so just take the cassette in for processing  all the camerastore people do when you bring in one of the disposables is rip it apart toss the film cassette into the tobeprocessed bin and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in another  if you take it apart yourself you get an aa alkaline battery still with a fair bit of life in it and all kinds of little bits and pieces from the camera  i expect you could even reload and reuse the camera if you were really determined   svr0 resembles a highspeed collision    henry spencer  u of toronto zoology between svr0 and sunos     dick dunn    henryzootorontoedu  utzoohenry  
      i thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post  some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries    one year i left the batteries in the garage  the garage is unheated   they were left in their places that they needed to be  one in the riding lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle  the battery in the  riding lawnmower was about 00 years old and one of the cycle batteries  was new and one was around 0 years old  upon spring time i discovered that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged  they all worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced  about halfway through the summer  they had originally been stored in the garage and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring   last year i decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete  i brought in all three and discovered in the spring about 00 days ago that not only were the batteries dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and  the ampmeter read around 0000000000  in other words it was pinned the internal circut tripped and i went on to the other batteries  they were the same      realizing that we still had 0 gigantic sailboat batteries also lead acid i decided to put the charger on them  these had been sitting for around 0 and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only needed a small charge around 0 hours or so on trickle  i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they worked fine for around 00 of em    this leads me to believe one of several things      0 i bought really tty batteries last year sorta true      0 the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the         batteries      0 there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the            room where the concrete is       0 the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air          better than concrete  btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room       any other ideas     could be the aliens anything is possible    
  it isnt the average temperature that is the key factor here but rather which is better at transferring the heat out of the presumably warmer than ground temperature battery  uh bob why is the battery warmer than ground temperature  on the time scales in question and with the considerably reduced temperature swings several feet underground there isnt going to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what its sitting on   question  why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the  surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it  because the temperature of your hand unlike that of the battery is determined by the balance between internal heat production and external heat loss  youre feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object your hand which is kept much warmer than its surroundings  in the case of an object with no significant internal heat production this will affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings if it started out not in equilibrium with them but wont affect the final temperature  for the same reason windchill affects whether you will freeze but not whether water will freeze   svr0 resembles a highspeed collision    henry spencer  u of toronto zoology between svr0 and sunos     dick dunn    henryzootorontoedu  utzoohenry

        would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency is there any easy way to do either of these im looking for  the simplest circuit possible i guess what im asking for is some sort of color organ but not quite let me trt to explain again  look for information about 000 tone decoder chip it is an easy to use chip for detecting sound of certain frequency you need only one 000 and some other componets for each led you want to control the chip can take the voltage levels which the casette gives radio shack archer semiconductor reference guide gives good information how to use that chip it should be simplest way to go the chip costs something like 00   tomiengdahlhutfi    lowerys law thenniksulahutfi    if it jams  force it if it breaks                         it needed replacing anyway   this text is provided as is without any express or implied warranty

   this has been an interesting thread to follow and obviously this group wasnt intended as a forum for the discussion of piracy has anyone seen any estimates of the lost revenue due to pirates  i was wondering if piracy is more rampant in home or corporate computing environments  i would tend to think that business environment piracy is the major contributor to this form of lost revenue  so many companies will purchase a few copies of a software package and then employees will internally distribute them as if they owned a sitelicense  what do you guys think

  dplattntgcom dave platt writes    what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects  the affected equipment is about 000 feet from the road    might be a couple of hundred watts from the sound of it  kicking sound  out of the tv and stereo speakers by direct rf rectification requires a  mighty strong carrier  ive heard of linears so powerful that  triggering them while the car was idling would stall the engine by  pulling down the battery voltage  it would take a lot more than that it sounds like the radio equipment is actually not shut completely off  but just goes to a standby situation  i suspect that the stories are just that stories  the voltage can only be sucked down so far instantaneously when you try to jumpstart someones  car when your vehicle is at idle does your car stall no the other car just does not crank well  now the engine might stall because the idle was too low to start with when the extra current is drawn the idle speed will drop  as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the increased amperage requirement   is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company the fcc or both    ultimately its likely to be your problem to resolve im afraid  the  fcc is so understaffed that they dont pay much attention to citizen  complains about rfi or so ive heard theyll just send you a  pamphlet describing how you can apply corrective measures    talking to the power company might help  they might be able to install  filtering devices at your service panel or recommend a type which you  could have installed by a licensed electrician  a transmitter is not going to be affecting house power if surges are occurring there it is due to another cause  not a transmitter   unfortunately theres a fair chance that enough signal is being picked  up by your house wiring that a simple servicepanel filter wont  suffice  you may need to install heavyduty rfi filters at the power  connections of your affected equipment  it is probably not that much of a problem often  toroid coils on the power leads will solve that part of the interference problem it will not solve internal equipment deficiencies   if the problem occurs regularly you may need to stake out the street  in question and watch for trucks or cars with big antennae driving by  at the time interference occurs  if you can identify the vehicle which  is transmitting you may be able to contact its owner and complain  it is probably not the transmitter that is at fault if the person is an amateur then heshe will probably be willing to help  if you explain that the person is causing interference  bill  
  drandspinnerosforg douglas s rand writes       hams can legally run up to 0000 watts  it is very unlikely however     that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  ham rigs    not possible either  youd need about a 000 amp alternator for  just the amplifier  i can just see it  you need to slow  down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button  well  000 amps anyway transmissions are generally for a short interval the battery would supply the rest of course if you transmitted too much you would run the battery down  it really would not be that much of a brake  even at 00 efficiency 0000 watts would only consume 0 horsepower  bill

  brianucsdedu brian kantor writes  while its possible that its a ham radio transmitter that youre  hearing it isnt likely  every bit of signal that doesnt go out the  antenna is wasted as far as a ham is concerned and most hams are  it is the radiated signal that would cause the problem   technically competent to ensure that they dont waste any signal if they  can possibly avoid it  to get their ham license they had to pass a  government exam that tests them on that point among others    however you could be hearing a radio transmitter for sure  there are  lots of other services where the operators arent required to be  technically competent  citizens band cb for example  there is nothing in the amateur radio tests that requires an technical competence at all it is a simple matter to memorize all the questions and answers  however that said most hams that i know do spend quite a bit of time gaining some technical skill   listen to the interference  if you hear voices clearly it almost  certainly isnt ham radio and might well be cb  if you can record a  dont count on that   bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operators house  and ask him for his opinion of what youre hearing  most communities  you cannot do that legally however you can ask a ham over to listen if the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would be possible to do such scheduling  if nothing else you could invite the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes if he does then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to make it immune to rf interference   have a ham radio interference committee whose members are most willing  to help you resolve interference complaints  look in the phone book or  ask at the local ham radio store or call the fcc for contact info  the fcc may or may not have such information they have enough to do without getting calls for such information if nothing else call your city offices or police department general business number they should have the name of a local ham contact   if its a ham hes more than likely willing to help get rid of the  problem  after all it would be his signal hes wasting  if it isnt  the interference committee or the fcc may be able to suggest solutions  see above  your concept of wasted signal is erroneous if his rig is transmitting properly then the chance of interference with the exception of harmonic television interference is the greatest  since he is putting out the strongest signal   it is unfortunately the case that a transmitting station that is  operating perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a  piece of consumer audio or tv equipment just because the manufacturer of  the consumer equipment cut corners on one little section of the device  that wouldnt affect one person in a thousand but which bites you  often that can be remedied for just a few pennies by a knowledgeable  person perhaps even the person operating the transmitter youre  hearing  unfortunately most consumer equipment is succeptable  it is all poorly designed   btw hams are allowed amplifiers cb isnt  illegal ham amplifier  doesnt compute  it does but not for a mobile radio there are very few mobile rigs that could power a 0000 watt amplifier  bill

   stuff about hardware keys  if you put another computer on the port instead of the key you can hack  them by reading what happens so ive been told ive never seen this done  but i think its possible youd need some hardware knowledge and some  software to read the port  true which is why many of the newer keys ship out oh maybe 00 bits or so have the key encrypt them and return them to the pc  making a bunch of these 00 bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure things wont run without the key   anyway then this scheme at least defeats your approach  its a little costly though  personally i dont believe in copy protection and agree with the thought that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs the gains from what few pirates wont be able to copy the program  joel kolstad   
   i just bought a little gizmo that is supposed to be installed in series with the tip or ring lines of the phone wire which ones are those suppose i am holding a regular phone wire such that the little plastic tooth on the little plastic square thing with the naked lead ends that you plug into the phone is facing down and away from me which of the 0 wires that i see is the tip and which is the ring please reply to mlevinhusc0harvardedu  mike levin  mike ring is the red wire tip is the green wire of most standard phone lines they two constitute the two wires most often used for voice telephone the two live lines they are the two innermost connectors of an rj00 phone jack  another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from red to green ring to tip tipgreen being at ground potential of the voltmeter it should read 00 volts in the onhook noring position i am 00 sure its 00 v and not 00 volts doesnt hurt a phone too much if theyre reversed its just bad if one happens to somehow get grounded to earth ground elsewhere  additionally when offhook the voltage drops to about 0 to 0 volts dc i think it is supposed to correspond to a 00 to 00 ma current loop and lastly when ringing the two wires develop an ac potential of about 00 v pp at 00 to 00 hz across them where you get the electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from  hope that clears things squishendorharvardedu     
       where can i buy blinking leds besides radio shack       does anyone sell blinking leds with variable flash rate by voltage     i guess if so what hertz pulse rate are they adjustable or set to       id like blinking leds that can be set for approx 0 hz 00 hz       00 hz or 00 hz something like that im interested in whats      out there for flash rates i like the idea of leds with flasher       circuits already in them i hate soldering ics in general guess i      dont have a hell of a lot of patience          thanks           dana  if you want slow led flash rates adjustable by switches or by a 00000000 digitally controlled switch i suggest looking at a 000 oscillator chip they cost 0 at radio shack much cheaper in quantity at quality places and you will be able to find good info about simple circuits in a 000 oscialltor notebook i think forest mims has one at radio shack youll have to toy with resistorcapacitor values or you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequencies any engineer worth his salt can make a 000 osciallator its in the book and left up to you to see i hate doing ascii circuit graphics the 000 can accurately go from a few hz to about 000 khz i think  about the tape recorder gizmo you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel as a data line for flashing led and one as audio line for voice or music this would eliminate a lot of noise  the data line is probably most easily done by some kind of pll or bandpass filter using just an opamp the 000 chip is a good pll and not hard to work with however if you nothing about how a pll works i suggest you dont try this opamp information can also be found in the forest mims radio shack infobooklets and the popular 000 opamp is a snap to work with setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy so i would suggest the 000 method firstmost i have no idea what this is going into so i am really generalizing  as for manufacturing techniques if youre only goofing with it i suggest you breadboard the thing no need to solder wirewrap would be the next more permanent step and lastly solderingpcb making hope that clears things  squishendorharvardedu

        i thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post    some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries      one year i left the batteries in the garage  the garage is unheated    they were left in their places that they needed to be  one in the riding  lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle  the battery in the   riding lawnmower was about 00 years old and one of the cycle batteries   was new and one was around 0 years old  upon spring time i discovered  that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged  they all  worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced   about halfway through the summer  they had originally been stored  in the garage and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring    last year i decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts  one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete  i brought in all three and  discovered in the spring about 00 days ago that not only were the batteries  dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and   the ampmeter read around 0000000000  in other words it was pinned  the internal circut tripped and i went on to the other batteries  they  were the same       realizing that we still had 0 gigantic sailboat batteries also lead  acid i decided to put the charger on them  these had been sitting for around 0 and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only  needed a small charge around 0 hours or so on trickle  i tested them  by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they  worked fine for around 00 of em     this leads me to believe one of several things       0 i bought really tty batteries last year sorta true       0 the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the          batteries       0 there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the             room where the concrete is        0 the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air           better than concrete    btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room         any other ideas      could be the aliens anything is possible      the leadacid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction   pb  pbo0  0h0so0  0pbso0  0h00   lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water   the standard heats of formation at 00 c 00 f of the various compounds are                 heat of formation compound      at 00 c kcalmole           pb               000   pbo0            000  h0so0           00000  pbso0           0000   h00             000000   the heat of reaction at 00 c is therefore 000 kcal per mole pbso0 produced note that lead sulfate is not very soluble 00000 grams per 000 grams water at 00 c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery  i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but i may be wrong  oh well i dont have a corroded battery to corrobate and i dont feel like thinking through it right now   what is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy discharging  if moisture with dissolved electrolytes acid rain condenses on the battery a conductive path between the terminals may form  this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds the reaction is reversible if electricity from an alternator or battery charger is put back into the battery   leadacid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge  each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction  the nonreacting posts terminals of the leadacid battery are there to remove or add electric energy during a discharge or charge  because the reaction is exothermic it has a tendency to happen though quite slowly under normal circumstances  so while keeping the battery dry is a good idea it is not a total solution   to understand why leadacid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechateliers principle which can be paraphrased as  anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position  here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials

conductivity for dirt diatomaceous earth goes down with temperature  also 000 c is about 000 k and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth  the thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of 00 greater than that of dirt and is 00 times greater than wood   it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood  at any instant the discharge reaction is occurring energy is being released either as electricity or heat  thermal conductivity of air is about 0000 btuhrftftfft during storage except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery this energy is mostly released as heat  the higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface  thus if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 00 times faster than that on dirt   this is where lechateliers principle comes into play  removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion  if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced  a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface  store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have 0 surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction along   also if water evaporates from the battery that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water  this will tend to drive the discharge reaction   jeff white      jhwhit00ulkyvxlouisvilleedu   how do i get

   being in the visualization stage of a circuit design right now i was wondering what the best way to scale an ac voltage using an 0bit digital word is i am thinking of using the common method of sending the word through an adc and then comparing it with the ac voltage converted to a sawtooth wave to get a duty cycle however i am leary of this method because it a requires a lot of parts and more importantly b creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire ac line i realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference but that would require more parts and boost the price further someone mentioned to me that they had seen an ic which input 0 bits of data and directly scaled the ac voltage coming in all onchip unfortunately he couldnt remember the chip number or the manufacturer if anyone else has heard of this chip please email me i am building this project as a dimmer box for a light controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user wishes to control well each channel at least therefor if each box costs 000 i doubt that an end user will want to dish out 000 x 00  0000 for sixteen channels this is something i have noticed about todays dimmer boxes they are so expensive anyway any help which someone could offer on either a method of easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me always the preferred method  will be greatly appreciated  michael carr mcarronuedu

  there is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlettpackard  older original deskjet and possibly deskjet 000 units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side viewed from front of the printer  newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide  the black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out  there was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation  hp placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism  i did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer  i dont have the information handy  i suggest contacting your nearest hp service center for information on obtaining the kit  hp has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade  i upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 000  the kit was fairly expensive  you are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 000 now that prices have declined so much  upgrading an original deskjet to 000 requires a fair amount of skill but no soldering  upgrading a deskjet plus to a 000 is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts  contact your hp service center for further information  the pcl language used by deskjets is considerably different from the pcl used by laser printers especially the newer laser printers  the biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line  this makes no material difference for lasers but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster  as you might guess the result is hideously slow printing  the new dos wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior  from the way wordperfect works this would not be easy to change  windows wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the dos drivers instead of windows  the pcl0 dialect used in the laserjet iiip allows compression that permits a full page 000 dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory  an uncompressed image could be as large as about 000 kbytes but the printer needs about 000k of memory for its internal housekeeping  laserjet iv models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations  deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts  a single page from a laserjet only requires about 00 seconds  this is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer  the presumption of course being that the laser printer has completed its warmup cyle  until ink chemistry is changed wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable  i wont use the word impossible but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely chosing an appropriate paper type helps but does not eliminate the problem  laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components  hp does accept return of spent toner cartridges mitigating the material waste problem to a degree  energy waste could use more work  warmup times have decreased allowing standby current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet iv  kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system  the image drum is good for approximately 000k copies  it is a very nice print engine  i wish hp used the kyocera engine  kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system  the recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of hps laser printers  the pickup pressure rollers are subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out  the usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper the paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from hp service  replacement cost for the transport is almost 000  the feed rollers are not separately replacable though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician i have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer  it depends upon the application which printer is best for you  if you only print 0 or 00 pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output the deskjet is a very good choice  as noted the deskjet 000 is my choice for personal use     bill mayhew      neoucom computer services department rootstown oh  000000000  usa    phone 0000000000 wtmuhuraneoucomedu 00000000    000000 n0wed

  what are peoples opinions about laser detectors  escort makes a laser detector the passport 0000 and claims it works fine  however ive talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you are lucky  ie if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in front of you and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your detector  otherwise it wont work  regular radar of course travels in all directions hence it is more detectable  any comments  escort has a deal till the end of april i think where if you buy their wideband passport 0000  x k ka and laser detectors youll save 00 off of buying them separately  in this case the addition of the laser detector over the passport 0000 is only 00 ie passport 0000 normally costs 000  eddie gornish university of illinois  center for supercomputing research  development  gornishcsrduiucedu

  kuusamakaarnecstutfi kuusama juhavtt writes  not that the question is anything important but i am still curious why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green i have seen a few blue ones but no red yellow company logo etc is there a technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have not tought about it yet  the green layer is a soldermask and is used to make a finished board look neat and to avoid solder bridges especially when using wave soldering or any other mechanized approach ive seen red mask but most that ive seen are green  a bakelite board will look brown in colour and if the solder mask is put on looks like a brown board with green paint on either side or just one side of the board a fibreglass board will look green from the side because the green soldermask makes the board appear that colour if you got a fibreglass board with no mask it would be a whitishgrey colour teflon boards do exist as well but im not sure about that one  id guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green so theyre not about to change also any change in any chemical probably requires a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards a lot of companies do not make their own boards they ship them to a real boardhouse

   why are circuit boards green  the material used to make them goes by two names  if it is used to make circuit boards it is called fr0  the same material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a structural material and is called g00  fr0 and g00 are both green  they are not green because of a solder masking agent  the basic ingredients are a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers  i am not sure what the specs are on the resin but if you are really curious you can call nema national electronics manufacturing association or ciba geigy a major manufacturer of epoxy resins to find out  as an aside i occasionally mix clear epoxy and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments the proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in g00  they are the same green color

  the leadacid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction   pb  pbo0  0h0so0  0pbso0  0h00   lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water heats of formation deleted the heat of reaction at 00 c is therefore 000 kcal per mole pbso0 produced note that lead sulfate is not very soluble 00000 grams per 000 grams water at 00 c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery  i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but i may be wrong  oh well i dont have a corroded battery to corrobate and i dont feel like thinking through it right now  the major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an acid solution pbso0 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out  also h0so0 is in a water solution as 0h00 and so0  thus the heats of formation of pbso0 and h0so0 are for the most part irrelevant  what is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy discharging  as it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic heat producing more about this later  what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this were talking leadacid batteries of course the battery slowly self discharges  as this discharge takes place two things happen the level of pb ions in the acid solution increases ie the lead            and lead oxide plates are dissolved         the level of h00 ions in the acid solution decreases ie the solution            becomes less acidic or more like water if you like now as the post to which i am responding correctly stated pbso0 will precipitate in a water nonacid solution  when the battery dies ie is fully discharged we end up with a high concentration of pb and so0 in water  so pbso0 forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery of course this happens in varying degrees the more discharged the more precipitate forms  the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery  if there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate more common in a newer battery a dead short results  i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition but they are for the most part useless  they can dissolve the pbso0 but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly  you may have some success with these products for a newer battery  stuff deleted to understand why leadacid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechateliers principle which can be paraphrased as  anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position  here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials stuff deleted this is where lechateliers principle comes into play  removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion  if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced  a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface  store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have 0 surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction along  this stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid in fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures  a logical consequence of the above argument is this if you really want your car to start lower the battery temperature to  00 to pull the reaction along  we all know from experience at  least those of us in canada do it gets cold up here that this is not true  if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery  besides which there is not enough energy released through self discharge  to appreciably raise the temperature  the air would amply dissipate any  such heat whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not  this  is of course irrelevant since you would want the battery to be cool  during storage  just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged

   what are peoples opinions about laser detectors  escort makes a  laser detector the passport 0000 and claims it works fine  however  ive talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you  are lucky  ie if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in  front of you and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your  detector  otherwise it wont work  regular radar of course travels  in all directions hence it is more detectable  any comments    escort has a deal till the end of april i think where if you buy  their wideband passport 0000  x k ka and laser detectors youll  save 00 off of buying them separately  in this case the addition of  the laser detector over the passport 0000 is only 00 ie passport  0000 normally costs 000  uniden makes an all in one unit x k ka laser for about 000 colorado radar sells passive radar jammers the passive supposedly being legal for about 000 wont help you with laser however  scott

  i wrote    bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operators house   and ask him for his opinion of what youre hearing  most communities    you cannot do that legally however you can ask a ham over to listen  if the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would  be possible to do such scheduling  if nothing else you could invite  the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes  if he does then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to  make it immune to rf interference  as a coupld of people have pointed out  this is wrong it is not illegal to record or disclose what you heard on the ham bands   bill

  has anyone got an active filter design program that runs on an ibm pc   something that will easily let me specify bandpass filter parameters and it will give me the appropriate component values   it has to be public domain  if anyone has one could you mail it to me  thanks in advance  scott u0000000wraithcsuoweduau  ps it can run under windows if necessary    
     the color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of it    original and older boards were bakelite composition and were brown  phenolic spelling was a tan  most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green  filled fiberglass is blue  teflon is white    rubbish the reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is used older boards bakelite and phenolic rarely used a solder mask these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques and hence are the colour of the compound used to make them these days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during soldering and also to prevent the decomposition of traces under harsh environments the light and dark green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them usually applied as a complete film photographically produced the blue and red or orange boards are a twopart epoxy or a liquidimageable resist formulation and are applied in a different manner theres a lot of info about the pros and cons of each but thats another story      slan go foill                     risky b  geoff swan research  development            swaneemegacomau megadata pty ltd                             000 waterloo rd north ryde                       00 0 000 0000 nsw 0000 australia                       v          fax 00 0 000 0000

   on benzene and acetone not only is benzene a carcinogen it is adsorbed through the skin and cause cumulative damage to the bone marrow which is essential to the production of your blood cells  it is highly toxic one exposure is unlikely to kill you but it will likely do hidden damage  benzene is one compound that chemists try like hell to avoid using acetone is much less toxic but is highly flammable and volatile  it also dissolves lots of things so handle with great care   jonathan g harris department of chemical engineering  mit rm 00000  00 ames street cambridge ma 00000 harrisathenamitedu 0000000000  fax 0000000

  acetone will likely damage the carpet first solvent to try is denatured alcohol do not waste your time with rubbing alcohol you can use methyl alcohol instead of denatured alcohol if you want to have a cocktail while you are removing the goo use pure grain alcohol  if the alcohol does not work try carbon tetrachloride if neither of these work you may need to try a stronger solvent but the alcohol works for most adhesives good luck  jim

  i know this is a long shot but does anyone know what solvent i should  use to clean ducttape adhesive from carpet  yet another suggestion but this one is nontoxic although i would handle it like any other cleaner and it smells nice  the chemical is called dlimonene and it smells like lemon peels i think it is a lemon extract of some kind  you might find it in a hardware store sold as a generalpurpose solvent but your best bet would be any bike store  it is used as a chaincleaning fluid  it works on sticker glue crayons grease oil etc  its clear yellow in the bottle and you can use it straight if you add water it changes to a creamy consistency which is good for some jobs  peter

  the 000cd is one of three oscillators that hp made many years ago  the others were the low frequency oscillator and the wide range  oscillator these are the ones with the 0 diameter chrome dial a wein bridge circuit that used pilot lights as the feedback loop and firebottles that produced many volts of output  ive just acquired a pair of these venerable old beasts  the nonworking one sn 000 owned by crosley radio at one point needs help i know i can likely buy a microfiche copy of the book  from hp but that costs and considering i paid a dollar for the pair in the rain at the dayton hamvention  does anyone have such a book they could copy parts of for me thank you

  just a quick question  what standard lab solvents can be used to clean electronic equipment and components safely ie not corrode dissolve shortout etc the equipment water methanol ccl0  you dont say what kind of electronic equipment you mean  its hard to give a generic answer  there is essentially no solvent that wont do things like washing lubricant out of switches  when weve needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things weve just used distilled water  the key thing to remember is to make sure the gear is completely dry before powering it up again  we let it dry for several days to be damn sure  i doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water  i would be very wary of ccl0 not least because it is dangerous to you even if its not going to harm the equipment  not only is it poisonous but i believe its now known to be carcinogenic   svr0 resembles a highspeed collision    henry spencer  u of toronto zoology between svr0 and sunos     dick dunn    henryzootorontoedu  utzoohenry

    i am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular american phone  on your home system i vaguely remember a few years ago when deutsche  bundespost split into postdienst postbank and telekom there was some  discussion about a new regulation i know that cordless or cellular phones  still have to be approved by the telekom but does that hold true for regular  phones in my areacode in germany 0000  frechen near koeln you can use  yes it does all the equipment has to have that telekom approval number to be legal what has changed is that you can buy the equipment somewhere else im pretty sure the same holds true in sweden at least when i read some information on it about tweo years ago and btw i do know that most of the lines in sweden can handle tonedialing just dont be sure that all can    wolfgang diestelkamp wdcstuberlinde wolfgangfirstgmdde

   ive bothered the rental shops and audio shops about the problem but most of them have precious little experience in dealing with generated power  my suspicion is that i dont really need anything larger than 0kw and this could all be resolved with a transformer of some sort  nope  your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the long cable from the generator or just plain not having enough power  i would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short peaks  you can try using larger and shorter cables to the generator or try strapping the amps for 000v service and running 000v mains cables out which will minimize the line drop  if these dont work though youre going to need a bigger generator  i assume that youre using wellmaintained generators and have watched the voltage output on the generator properly  if you dont have 000v coming out of the unloaded generator youll never get 000v at the other end  can anyone offer any advice  i want to do a lot of outdoor events this summer and it would be nice if this power problem could be resolved easily ive been looking into buying a powerpack so i could tap into junction boxes directly but have no idea where to start  one that would resolve my generator problems as well would be of high value to me  i recommend you talk with an electrician who has experience in this sort of work and not with the proaudio people  also i recommend that you dont try to tap into junction boxes at all but hire a licensed electrician if you dont really know what you are doing  ive had to clean up after two people who nearly killed themselves playing in hot 000a boxes and it wasnt much fun scott  
   basically i am looking for something to operate in the ranges of accelerations found in an automobile environment i would like the device to operate as a trigger for other systems when the cars deceleration reaches a threshold value which is how i assume some seat belt lock mechanisms and air bag deployment systems work  open up one of the airbag control boxes  they have inexpensive piezoelectric accelerometers in them  i know that the gm cars use the setra units  the cheapest way to get such an accelerometer is to cannibalize an existing automotive unit  incidentally these things arent very linear but for the application they would do a fine job scott  
   while i have gotten 00 years out of this digital receiver it has been acting verry strange of late  i hope that  the following symptoms may help someone diagnose the error   i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had  has long died thus if i unplug it  it wont remember the presets   it has given up listening to the remote  i tried changing the remotes batteries when i try a remote function  the receiver registers that it received it a green remote light flashes but the right function doesnt happen  if any function at all  also strange when i hit  the mute button for example the display panel goes black  yikes ive never seen that before    before all the strangeness started the system turned itself off and on again  by itself   sometimes it wont play a radio station so i have to kinda twist it  yes kinda flex the motherboard chasis for it to get the radio tuning back  the aux in function always works however  it is inconvenient but not inconvenient enough to pay an  expensive repair fee  while im not a hardware guy i wonder  if something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix the strange thing is that these symptoms come and go   someone told me this unit series has a bad voltage amp chip  anyway  arghh cjk
