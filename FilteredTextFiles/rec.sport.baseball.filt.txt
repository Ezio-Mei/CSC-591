  the orioles pitching staff again is having a fine exhibition season four shutouts low team era well i havent gotten any baseball news since march 00 but anyways could they contend yes could they win it all  maybe  but for all those fans of teams with bad spring records remember earl weavers first law of baseball from his book on managing  no one gives a damn in july if you lost a game in march   btw anyone have any idea on the contenders for the os fifth starter its pretty much set that sutcliffe mussina mcdonald and rhodes are the first four in the rotation  here at johns hopkins university where the mascot is the blue jay  their baseball team logo was the toronto clubs logo now its a  anatomically correct blue jay god cant they think of an original idea its even in the same pose as the baltimore oriole on the os hats how many people realize that the bird is really called a baltimore oriole  admiral steve c liu        internet address admiraljhunixhcfjhuedu committee for the liberation and intergration of terrifying organisms   and their rehabilitation into society from red dwarf  polymorph      the bangles are the greatest female rock band that ever existed    this sig has been brought to you by frungy the sport of kings        
  ive read all of the followups to this but i thought id go back to the original article to make specific comments about the method   jaomegatestcom john oswalt said  he has obtained the play by play records in computer readable form for every major league baseball game for the past several years he devised an algorithm which i call sumoversituations and wrote a computer program to calculate every major league players contribution using it  it works like this  look at every situation in every game in a baseball season  a situation is determined by inning score where the baserunners are and how many outs there are  for each situation count how many times the team eventually won the game that the situation occured in and divide by the number of times the situation came up to come up with a value for that situation  this was first done by george lindsey in the late 00searly 00s and reported in   articlean investigation of strategies in baseball authorgeorge r lindsey journaloperations research issuevolume 00 0 julyaugust 0000 pp 000000  later pete palmer did the same thing using simulated seasons to generate a larger set of data to avoid the kind of smallsample anomalies that other people have worried about  he reported this in thehiddengameofbaseball with john thorn  gary skoog modified the method a bit and did some work on what he called a value added measure based on these situational values his were based directly on marginal runs though not on win probabilities these results as applied to the 000 season were reported in one of the bill james baseball abstract books 0000  help me out here somebody  for example a situation might be inning 0 score 00 runner on second and no outs  there were 0000 regular season major league games last year  with the rockies and marlins there will be more this year say this situation came up in 000 of those and the team ahead won 00 of them  then the value of this situation is 000  description of method look at change in win probability based on the at bat  plus any baserunning and creditdebit the player by that amount each time  he gets a plate appearance  now for each player sum up all his atbat and baserunning values for the season to obtain an overall value for that player  obviously the sum of all players values for each game and for the season as a whole will be 0  thats only because you always credit x to the batter and x to the pitcher theres no validation involved  ok theres a very big problem here that nobody has yet commented on youre adding probabilities and probabilities dont add  runs you can add the total team runs breaks down into how many runs joe contributed plus how many runs fred contributed etc  but probabilities dont work that way  if bob increases his teams chance of winning by 0 in each of 000 pas that does not mean that bob increased his teams chance of winning by 000  in fact it doesnt mean anything because the units are screwy  i agree and disagree  john is saying that the batters efforts will result in 0 more wins then losses  while you are probably correct that 000 does not mean 0 more wins then losses it means something  i would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 0 in each of 000 pas then i would a player who increased my chances of winning by 0 in each of 000 pas  thus there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between johns statistic and winning games  thus before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is  consider an example  bob hits a 0out solo hr in the bottom of the first about 00 on your scale  he does the same thing again in the fourth with the score tied for another 00  and again in the seventh with the score tied for another 00  and finally in the ninth to win the game by a score of 00 for a value of 00  bob hit 0 solo hr in 0 plate appearances and was credited by your method with 00  00  00  0  00  but what does that mean  was bob 00 responsible for the win  certainly not the defense is always 00 responsible if you include pitching in that and bob wasnt pitching  in fact bob was only 00 of the offense which is a lot but not even close to 000  furthermore what about the other 0 team runs  say they all came on solo hr by fred then fred was hitting hr to tie up the game which are just as valuable as hr to take the lead see lindsey and fred will himself have accrued a good 0 rating or so  so fred and bob combined have amassed 000 of a win in one game  theres clearly a problem here  the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has  first we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game  second remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning  that is a player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases thus im not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 0 in that game  sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one  also the pitchers bad performances giving up 0 runs may have given them a large negative percentage for that game  also any batter that pulled an 00 night would give large negatives      greg thinking about the right things but his intuition is off the mark  closers are enormously important  the total number of runs value is outweighed by when they come or are prevented from comming the doubling which greg allows is not enough  in another article i proposed a test of this  we can predict a teams  wonlost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs total they score and allow without regard to when those runs score in the game  if late runs are really more important than early runs then looking only at late runs should lead to a better predictor right  no but really only because you have a smaller sample size  i would think however that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning  and realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation not a blow out  it is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning  look a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games  on the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win  the offence has many more outs to do something about  but i am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either  if i am down 0 runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth         heres another thought experiment apply this method to basketball  what you find is that points scored in the first half of the game have almost exactly no value because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play furthermore the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with no time on the clock gets a 00 for the game while the star forward who  scored 00 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero  does this make sense   no but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made  look if you are down 0 point with 0 seconds left there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball  and do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls bad defense etc caused a negative chance that the team would win   from reading all of the discussion on this statistic i feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda at first look this statistic valadates clutchness  but it really does not  cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down  ive never seen convincing proof that this really happens so if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except for a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to player performance  there is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness  certainly we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example  we may find for instance that a home run increases your chance of winning by 00 on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 0 i bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses  how do we evaluate relief pitchers  say john and sam have the exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs ks bbs etc  both had exceptional numbers  john however only pitched in closer situations while sam was a mop up man  who was more valuble to their team  probably john  who was the better  pitcher  they were probably about the same

  theres a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid  i thought id put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant  i splurged and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars the highestpaid player is frank thomas at 000k  i cut some players like kenny lofton chris hoiles keith mitchell tim wakefield and a bunch of pitchers all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a cost of 0 million for the lot of them  the total team salary is  0000000 averaging slightly over 000k a player  if thats too steep you can dump thomas and bagwell replacing them with paul sorrento and a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars and still have one of the best teams in the majors  p juan guzman 000 p mussina000 p castillo    000 p eldred      000 p rhodes000 p militello   000 rp rojas000 rp beck000 rp melendez   000 rp hernandez000 rp nied000 c rodriguez000 c piazza      000 0b thomas000 0b bagwell    000 0b knoblauch000 0b barberie000 0b gomez0000 0b palmer000 ss listach000 ss pena000 lf gonzalez000 cf lankford000 rf rsanders000 of plantier000   ted frank                  however teel should have mentioned that though  thf0kimbarkuchicagoedu   his advice is legally sound if you follow it  the u of c law school       you will probably wind up in jail standard disclaimers                           james donald in misclegal

  the rotation has changed due to a strange injury to scott erickson  he  developed a twinge in the stomach area and has been taken out of the  rotation  new rotation to the best of my minds knowledge is kevin tapani jim deshais pat mahomes willie banks  add mike trombley in there somewhere since they need five people  mark guthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long lefty  as to ss and 0b short will be played by scott leius who played short for much of his career  before the twins  at third mike pagliarulo and jeff reboulet will platoon  pags and terry jorgenson will platoon at third with reboulet as the backup infielder  pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who lead the league in da in 0000 muffing what should be routine grounders heck muffing a grounder i would probably have gotten to  jorgenson did nothing exceptional that i noticed  leius missed a ball i think gagne would have reached we will certainly miss gags glove this season  winfield has struggled during preseason  sunday against the colorado  rockies he went 0 for 0 with 0 rbis and scored once  he looked pretty good there  contrary to what the mediots have been saying he looked reasonable at first  he isnt mid00s hrbek but then neither is the pretty big guy himself any more note  im used to seeing the twins 0b looking kinda big on the field but not that big  if he hits vaguely like last year hes a perfectly good first baseman  note  much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings  winfield may have big holes in his defensive game that didnt show up he didnt have to pick any bad throws for example but ill take what i saw so far  david thornley have tickets will travel to dome

     a less wellpublicized part of the now infamous darrin jackson for  derek bell trade was the fact that san diego included 000000 in the  deal  even less publicized than this however was that the 000000  didnt come from the padres but from an unnamed source and that the  money didnt go to the blue jays  in toronto the money was diverted  into a london bank account owned by a shadowy character named vincent  gray  i should be so lucky the account number must have been rejected    the odd thing was that gray wasnt some british financier but a  canadian social scientist working at the university of western  ontario  gray was previously known to the authorities only as an  associate of john palmer and as the man who had the previous year  discovered the true tater name of bing bang ben macdonald  to be accurate it is big bang ben macdonald   soon after that gray and palmer sent word to ottawa that canada had  achieved absolute superiority over the united states in the field of  baseballistic research as she controlled both the ackercook  pitchalike contest and the binaca blast research institute  the prime  minister smiled  i hope not  to think that i would inadvertantly give any pleasure to mulroney really ruins my day  ps matthew wall a marvellous ending to the section on the expos   okay so im not giving up the day job  but in an effort to help me  keep the day job ive managed to foist the job of running the binaca  blast deep drive derby onto vince gray to whom future deep  driverelated tidbits should be sent    vincesscluwoca or vincevaxisscluwoca please identify any messages with the subject line bbddd   vince can take this post as the cue to chime in about what he plans to  do as the new director of the research institute and what kind of  body armor ontarians are wearing this spring  meanwhile i have to go  pick up that truckload of denis boucher cards i bought to fill in the  area behind our tool shed    jking  realizing the taterific importance of this work john palmer and i concluded that we might be able to pool some resources i have not yet gone through the archives that jonathan sent to me when i do i will send out an official introduction to the deep drive derby  however i wonder if we need to rename the project now that the principal investigator and research archive have changed send your suggestions for a rename of the study to me at the address given above  and just think  its opening day  soon the balls will be flying out no get your minds out of the gutter of the ball parks and helpless bystanders will be injured by balls reentering the atmosphere and you thought that meteorite showers were made of rocks  who will be the stars this year can anyone hope to combat brad arnsbergs record start to last year  the season is young the balls newly rubbed in mud the hot dogs starting to boil for the rest of the year play ball and take cover  and may all your sliders hang  vince

        philadelphia at chicago  teams tied for 0st after sunday      dick redding battled chet brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series  one friday one saturday and a goodold sunday doubleheader what could be better declared ernie banks  perhaps the fact that the cubs are challenging      its pitching its always been pitching that weve lacked announced ryne sandberg  if we can get by brewer then beat carlton alexander or bunning  preferrably 0 of the last three  well know we might be able to win      lord i hope we pull it off      the phils scored once in the top of the first richie ashburn singled pete rose followed with a hit sending ashburn around second  kiki cuyler cut the ball off in left center and threw a bullet in to ernie banks who threw to ron santo to get ashburn at third  rose went to second on the play      christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center moving pete rose to third  schmidt was walked  the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them  both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw 000000 walks this year  chuck klein is starting to hit very well and he lashed a double into a gap in rightcenter  cool papa bells speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent schmidt from scoring  nellie fox was walked and bob boone grounded out to second ending the threat        teams are starting to realize that you dont have to pitch to schmidt or torrienti and that is lowering their run total  it puts a lot of pressure on klein and dick allen who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells rose at first and its a credit to the phillies that theyve been able to sustain their pace  the picthers have slumped at times  so came the analysis from frank chance      the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit thomas grounder moved him to second and  after sandberg made out  billy williams singled home a run  in the sixth ron santo launched a tworun homer to make it 00  dick redding got in trouble in the eighth as schmidt singled and klein singled him to third  ed reulbach entered to face fox but dick allen popped out of the dugout to hit  allen doubled to right but luckily for the cubs williams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense he fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third  lance parrish hitting for boone was walked and bruce sutter entered  larry bowa grounded into a 000 double play but ed delahanty walked as a pinchhitter  desiring a strikeout since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick trillo pinchrunning at third chance brought in lee smith who induced a popup to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder ending the inning  the cubs took the win 00 moving a game behind the phillies      steve carlton was called upon to battle 0finger brown saturday  to get another righthander in the lineup ron santo moved to first and bill madlock played third  unfortunately brown allowed six doubles and the cub bullpen was worn down even more as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against lefty  madlock batting sixth had knocked two doubles of his own driving home four runs  gabby hartnett hit two home runs and cuyler added another and the score was 00 cubs after six innings  the phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth as the cubs grabbed 0 more runs to ice an 000 triumph      sundays twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one point including a rare outsidethepark home run in the second game off robin roberts  grover alexander of the phils took the first contest 00 but the cubs captured the second one 00 with waddell gaining the win  bruce sutter tossed two innings for the save though he allowed one run in the eighth  the cardinals stood half a game behind these coleaders and would conclude their series with the expos on monday       montreal at st louisaugust 00 0way tie for 0st      dennis martinez is on a roll and he continued it versus john tudor friday the expos have a wide variety of hitters and  while they arent among the alltime greats they are getting the job done  after winning their first first two games they suddenly found themselves only 0 00 games out of first in this wacky season      martinez triumphed 00 on friday and williams outdueled dizzy dean 00 saturday  however the cardinals refused to give up winning 00 on sunday the cards captured mondays game too as steve carlton outdueled steve rogers 00  were really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed remarked lou brock  i dont see why we cant win this division      the phillies and cubs may have some reasons for them  twothirds of the way through the season there is a 0way tie for first       new york at pittsburghaugust 00 0 straight 00 wins for bucs now 0 back  but in 0th     when your team is in a slump like we are the worst thing is to play in a pitchers park like this spoke gil hodges before the series  keith hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year and it must be giving them an extra 00 wins  the pirates have made only 00 errors all season 0 ahead of the second place dodgers  error totals tend to be around 00 for the best defensive alltime teams      rube foster defeated sid fernandez 00 friday and candelaria outshone seaver 00 saturday in a game featuring some outstanding defense  when nolan ryan and two relivers 0hit the mets in another 00 win sunday the pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the 000 mark  they had been unable to several times in the past month  bert blyleven met dwight gooden in the afternoon game  both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs  a solo shot by rusty staub of the mets and a tworun blast by ralph kiner for the pirates  the mets darryl strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off jesse orosco working his second inning after mookie wilson pinchran for gary carter at second  with one out and a runner on first lee mazilli was sent in to pinchhit  the pirates countered with kent tekulve placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting barry bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter  tekulve induced a groundout forcing strawberry at second  he slid hard into honus wagner preventing the pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon  tekulve allowed a hit but clemente threw mazilli out at third from near the right field line ending the inning  tug mcgraw relieved randy myers who entered to pitch the eighth and got one out before bonds launched a rocket to deep center running through the stop sign at third to score an insidethepark homer to win  the pirates had scored an improbable 0 straight 00 wins and had moved to within 0 games of first place with seven weeks to go       san francisco at boswauktaaugust 00      another sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule as the giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldnt tire  in fact reported manager john mcgraw once this rough part of the schedule is over maybe as early as this coming week we may shift to a 0man rotation again for a little while      juan marichal continued his hot pitching friday beating lew burdette and the braves 00  willie mays had all four rbis on 0 hits  rick reuschel faced joe niekro saturday in a slugfest  the braves park had been a homer haven but this took the cake as the giants won a seesaw affair 0000 willie mays had three homers willie mccovey eddie matthews and don baylor had two and hank aaron ernie lombardi biz mackey and mel ott had one each  the braves had collected 000 home runs going into sundays doubleheader putting them on a pace for 000 which would be 0 short of the national league record  they were still a tad behind the 00 yankees pace they had allowed over 000 though  vida blue actually got the win after retiring 0 batters in the fifth  he allowed only a run in the sixth but faltered in the seventh  joe mcginnity earned the save      in the doubleheader the braves hoyt wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game but hank aaron homered off bill foster in the eighth as the braves won 00  the giants took the second game however by a 00 score the homer by aaron was a magical 000 by the braves however they fell to three game below 000 making a comeback extremely unlikely       san diego at cincinnatiaug 00  randy jones faced ewell blackwell in the first of this 0game series and the padres felt rather good  with don mattingly straining his back in the last cleveland game the trade looked even better  mcgriffs batting average was even rising  of course the bench was very poor and joe gordon was only adequate in the outfield but these were minor problems since the pitching was holding up      jones pitched a good game friday and won 00  mcgriff launched two home runs  mel harder earned a win with the help of mark davis and ray narleski saturday 00 was the final score  tom candiotti battled satchel paige to a 00 tie through eight innings before departing  the game was scoreless for 0 more innings until the thirteenth  paige had departed after 00 and john franco hurled a scoreless inning  tom browning was working his second scoreless inning when dave winfield doubled with one out and joe gordon was pitched around  thurm munson doubled both runners home and the padres gamed a 00 win  the threegame sweep had pulled the giants into a tie with the reds  though the reds denied it the highly emotional series with the dodgers may have taken too much out of them       brookangeles at houstonaugust 00      another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the astrodome  the astros sent joe niekro to the hill in the first game opposite don drysdale  normally drysdale remarked i would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them  i cant afford to with this team though we have to get our own runners going we cant afford to let the astros beat us  he then winked and said well maybe davis will get decked once      the fact that glenn davis leads the team in homers with six  is primarily why he would be decked but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season  the hitting on this team is a little better but the power is all doubles and triples  still carl furillo is the main reason no astro home runs were hit over the weekend as he threw two runners out trying for insidethepark homers  for those unaware of the nastness of the astros park they have a 00foot high gray wall all around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs  the foul poles are 000 feet from home plate but the alleys are 000 feet away with center field at 000 feet  its as if some threeyearold threw a tantrum and told his playmates if i cant hit home runs nobody will hit home runs remarked roy campanella      the dodgers stole five bases friday but the astros decided to revitalize the baltimore chopping that had failed 0 weeks before for tonight anyway davis jim wynn and jose cruz did not have to mess with their swings according to the manager  after poles and willie wells reached base via the baltimore chop drysdale decked jose cruz with a pitch  he responded with a tworun double but wynn  playing first for davis  popped up and the astros didnt score any more in that inning  they did score 0 in the fourth to erase a 00 deficit and the astros wound up winning 00  they threatened to do even better the next game as tommy john would be their opponent walt alston met privately with the starters at 0 am before the game      i think i know how we can beat the baltimore chop he explained      how can we do that pee wee reese wondered      theyre going to be beating the ball down so weve got to be ready to throw on the run  steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt but i want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws  well go with a shallow infield almost the whole time      the plan almost worked  mike scott allowed only two runs through eight innings but the astros got three two of them scored when bill doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third  00 astros was the final with dave smith earning another save  the dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill sunday as nolan ryan walked five three of whom scored in a 00 dodger win  fernando valenzuela lost the second game 00 to don sutton however as the dodgers thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough      were mostly a power team remarked ron cey  jackie and when he plays maury wills are our only real speed demons though a couple other plays can do it now and then  were sunk in a place like the astrodome  i guess thats why theyre so successful there  indeed it seems that basestealing teams give them the most

  dave this has never happened to me before kirsch writes   correction nied was the only player identified in this book as a grade a prospect who was exposed to the draft according to bill james in the stop the presses section preceding his player evaluations he valued nied at 00 and said that nieds value does not increase significantly as a result of his selection although he did catch a break getting away from the strongest rotation in baseball   i thought bill james latest book completely and totally sucked  i bought it but will not purchase anything of his ever again without thoroughly looking at it first  what tripe  the book is inconsistent and filled with selective analysis  james claims to be looking forward and then makes some absolutely bizarre statements of value  not only that but i got the impression he probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name on it   to say i was disappointed is a grand understatement          gary huckabay       kevin kerr the al feldstein of the mid00s   a living argument for  if theres anything we love more than a huge     existence of parallel  sig its someone quoting 000 lines to add           universes       0 or 0 new ones  and consecutive posts too

  mssnetcomcom mark singer said  i meant that one should not let the exception make the rule    its not an exception  good players come up young most players who come up young will be good  this has always been the rule   are most players who come up young always good when theyre young or later  worse its not a shift  this is the way it has always been  several detailed studies of this have been done and theyve all shown that players arent coming up any younger or older than in the past and they arent  playing any more or less in the minors than they used to  the only thing that shifts is our memories of the good old days   damn  i was afraid you would say that   but all after the fact which makes it not applicable to the current discussion which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who hasnt established himself in the majors over the mediocre veteran  the padres played santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth playing    well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there  but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion  and i happen to agree   both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers expected to be among the best ever in baseball    not by recsportbaseball consensus  that may sound like an incredibly arrogant comment but ive found that the sdcn consensus when one exists is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of baseball people affiliated with mlb    i can believe that  im a newbie here so ill take your word  but alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long as they feel he can also hit a bit  lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded seasoning   i dont know who knows  i suppose the same people or similar who know he will be better than some other catcher  these are of  course just differing opinions  i read that his arm is not that strong i suppose somewhere there is some measurement of sb ratios and that he is still learning to call a game  that latter skill may be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of his performance but it is a tangible skill  i disagree in that i dont think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership is  i dont deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but i really dont see any way that we could ever know who they are  nicholss law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously  sorry  new  dont know nichols law  dont believe in catchers era  but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers any info on that    absolutely  the evidence is piling up year after year  the only other alternative is that the braves really dont know that their young players are on average better than their current starters  im not ruling out that kind of gross incompetence but i think the salaryschedule explanation is more charitable  in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind  a different decision than we would make must be financial  i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no   consider we know that the braves are about the strongest team in baseball right now even with olson and lemke and nixon and bream in the lineup  they have as good a chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has it actually makes some sense to say rather than making our team marginally better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly lets go ahead and compete this year with what we have and then bring up the studs only as we have to so that well still have them under reserve three years from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions  is it fair to the young players  no  does it make organizational sense  i think it does  well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions  i mean please dont tell me how to run my business  especially when im being successful    ci could make it 000 or 000 wins if you let me bring up lopez  slisten bobby  id like to  but the way i see it if he hits the big club this year well be paying megaarbitration bucks down the road in a couple of years and theres no way i want to do that  and continues with  we can win without him and then keep winning next year with him hows that  im sure you could be right  you could also be smoking some illegal substance  hey  thats a joke  dont get offended  please   hey id love to be wrong about this  if you think its unlikely id love to know why  dont cite anybodys innate ethical rectitude though unless you know them personally   well i cant cite anyones ethical rectitude because i dont know what it means    but again if it makes organizational sense then so be it  baseball is a business and if there is a solid business reason for keeping lopez on the farm then thats what the braves should do  i happen to believe that its a baseball decision  while you from your armchair may disagee i dont  i think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made  i predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training  i think it is a very normal decision to have made  it is certainly more reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers  sure it may be conservative  it may also be logical  i dont know what ethics have to do with it seems like pretty good common sense to me  the beastmaster     mark singer     mssnetcomcom

  mssnetcomcom mark singer writes in article apr0000000000000000pilotnjinnet gajarskypilotnjinnet bob gajarsky  hobokenite writes javier lopez is a better catcher than greg olson but has there ever in the history of baseball been a 00yearold or younger rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league catchers in terms of defense and brought a 000 bat  wasnt it  sandy alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year not  wasnt it benito santiago who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year  not  hrm sandy alomar 00 year old rookie 000 games 000000000 threw out a few baserunners benito santiago 00 year old rookie 000 games 000000000 he threw out a few baserunners too ivan rodriguez 00 year old rookies 00 games 000000000 didnt exactly suck behind the plate  i can continue this thread with the others mentioned but you get the point  you and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the  seasoned veterans in favor of the hot young rookies  perhaps  just perhaps  the management team of the pennantwinning braves knows something more than you do  and perhaps what they know is that very very few 00 and 00year old rookies come up to the majors and make an impact   true which only makes it more important to realize when you have one of the few lopez season last year adjusted to major league equivalencies was 000000000 00 hrs how bad does he have to be behind the plate for that to not be better than olsons 000000000   mike jones  aix highend development  mjonesdonaldaixkingstonibmcom  i would not admire hitting against ryne duren because if he ever hit you in the head you might be in the past tense  casey stengel  
  i was watching peter gammons on espn last night and hes got me a little confused  while talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit from the fringe players theyll be facing mcgriff hitting 00 home runs sheffield getting 000 rbis and glavine winning 00 games  this was of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball has expanded early 00s late 00s late 00s  what really confused me though was the mention of al players who would do well next year  specifically roger clemens winning 00 games and the likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting 00 home runs  my question is  how in the hell will the rockiesmarlins help the al  the last time i looked there wasnt a lot of talent jumping leagues  did i miss something  dennis cleary dfclearyucdavisedu   i wondered the same thing  when he first mentioned it i thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over  and then in the examples from other years he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded  so since stats never lie   i guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making  every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that normally they would not have had there not been expansion  make sense

  date   mon 0 apr 0000 000000 0000 from   karim edvard ahmed ka0kandrewcmuedu  since i havent been able to keep up with baseball much this season i have a few questions about my favorite team the minnesota twins  0  how good does their rotation look  the last i heard the order is tapani erikson mahomes banks and some guy ive never heard of  sounds pretty pathetic to me  well maybe it will be  banks is a 00 yearold prospect who hasnt  matured as quickly as they would have liked  mahomes is a 00 yearold  who is very highly touted  tapani and erickson are also young and  have looked very good this spring  the last spot was between jim  deshaies formerly of houston and sd and mike trombley  deshaies  hasnt looked very good this spring so i believe that the spot has  gone to trombley although they hadnt wanted 0 starters this unproven  i personally believe very highly in mahomes and trombley   0  who is playing short and third  well scott leius is the shortstop  he played mostly 0b last year but  was a ss in the minors and moved back after gagne left to kc  0b is  split maybe between pagliarulo who has had a great spring and terry  jorgenson a good looking kid who has languished in portland for 0  years  im not sure how the time will be divided but they seem to be  happy with what they have here  i like jorgenson but i fear they  might give too much time to pags   0  hows winfield doing  sorry cant help you here  dennis

    well it really isnt this cut and dry but as a jay fan the thing i feared worst has happened the yanks sent down williams g and are going to start williams b in cf   i also believe they kept wickman and millitello in their rotation which is much nicer than that kaminiecki and mike witt combo i thought theyd throw out their to the slaughterhouse because of their experience granted witt might be good but i think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience   the yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards the jays with the loss of dave stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their pitching staff   the orioles should also be there in the end  gord niguma to salvage the season let jj olerud win mvp

   at age 00 alomar had a brilliant rookie year  true he was limited by injuries in his sophomore season but his numbers both that yaer and the year following were quite mediocre  this season the same bill james projects a ba of 000 ops of 000    the same bill james why do you say that it sounds like youre suggesting  bill james had something to do with overhyping the kid to death au contraire he was fairly critical of him after his roy campaign noting that he wasnt allworld as a catcher or a hitter he called him basically average when everyone else in the media was predicting the next johnny bench or roy campanella   both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers expected to be among the best ever in baseball  the reports i read indicate that lopez is very ordinary defensively    which reports are those   the dodgers options are parrish and hernandez and now only carlos piazza is 00  as long as he continues with his very hot bat they will keep him in the lineup because they need the offensive production  when he cools off look for the much better defensive catcher hernandez only 00 to play more    i like hernandez a lot but if piazza can catch the ball youve gotta play him imho hes a much better hitter although hernandez isnt a bad hitter right now it sounds like piazza will catch most of the time and hernandez will be candiottis caddy since he can catch the knuckler as long as they play up to their abilities the dodgers could have a very good catching tandem    the braves options are berryhill and olson  i agree that olson is nothing special but i do think berryhill is better than many  people on rsb believe  but both the braves catchers are very good defensively calling a game blocking the plate throwing and although they are somewhat weak offenivsively they play on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat    i think both are overrated defensively see nichols law of catcher defense but thats something thats difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine about the only tangible thing we can look at is opponents sb and thats clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners catchers era is a possibility but its subject to way too many biases     as for them playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat i disagree here too about the only chink in the braves armor is that theyre weak offensively at several positions cf c 0b ss if belliard plays 0b unless bream and hunter form another superplatoon and very weak  defensively if blauser plays id like to see the braves give at least one of mel nieves javy lopez or chipper jones a shot but much like the talentrich jays of recent years theyll be conservative and stick with what they have  im not saying thats wrong just conservative      dave hung like a jim acker slider kirsch      blue jays  do it again in 00  kirschstafftcumnedu                        new  quotes out of context not to beat a dead horse but its been a couple o weeks  this   disappoints mepunishmentsdischargesjackhammering  stephen lawrence

  usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season but the past few seasons have been incredible any thoughts on the new old reds uniforms  i remember seeing a pete rose rookie card and unless i miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds   the mets how about docs performance today have reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder and changed the mets insgnia on the front of the jersey  to my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 0000 and it reminds me a little of the dodger logo   many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform or at least uniforms that look more traditional phillies reds expos white sox padres etc and the once bright colors have been altered to gray  the trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years as opposed to the cookiecutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs no one in the comissioners office and interleague play on the horizon its nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be

  i just wanted to let everyone know that i have lost what little respect i have for jim lefebvre after seeing todays cubs game first of all how could he start maldonado over may after the way may played at the end of last year and the way he tore up the cactus league how could you let him sit the bench not to mention that a right hander maddux started i really blew my top when lefebvre pinch hit for rick wilkins with tommy shields how can you do that just because of the leftyrighty thing too much is made of that wilkins is twice the hitter that shields is then the next batter was jose vizcaino one of the weakest hitters i have ever seen and who had looked terrible at bat all day and lefebre let him hit while may still sat the bench i think even arnie harris was stunned by this because he showed may sitting in the dugout while vizcaino was batting face it lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in baseball a dishard cub fan

  is there any doubt that this is true  after a few down years the al east is back to where it was in the early eighties  with the emergence of the os and the yanks it is far and away the best  while the nl west has the best team in baseball and the reds arent bad either they have nothing else  the giants astros and padres all have talent they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the al east  and the dodgers just plain suck  as for the rockies who knows    the al east has the defending champs and although they lost a lot to free agency toronto is still one of the best in baseball  the orioles have the preseason favorite to win the cy young in mike mussina and you can never forget about ripken  the signings of harold baines and harold reynolds dont hurt to much either although i always liked bill ripken  while they let a lot go this summer randy milligan joe orsulak bill ripken bob milacki sam horn storm davis and craig lefferts they kept the heart of their team intact  my predicted finish 0 baltimore could be a biased opinion 0 ny yankees 0 toronto 0 milwaukee 0 detroit 0 boston 0 cleveland would have been higher if not for the accident  go os    
  briefly since im off to sleep  mles work pretty well for aa nd aaa players  players who are 00 and younger will tend to have explosions  in their numbers whether mmles or not in the next 0 years  players who are 00 and older at those levels generally have  inflated mles  theyre about as reliable as having major league stats for a player     bob gaj

  i was watching peter gammons on espn last night and hes got me a little confused  while talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit from the fringe players theyll be facing mcgriff hitting 00 home runs sheffield getting 000 rbis and glavine winning 00 games  this was of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball has expanded early 00s late 00s late 00s  what really confused me though was the mention of al players who would do well next year  specifically roger clemens winning 00 games and the likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting 00 home runs  my question is  how in the hell will the rockiesmarlins help the al  the last time i looked there wasnt a lot of talent jumping leagues  did i miss something  only if you persist in believing that peter gammons is more knowledgable about baseball than the average mailbox  okay im overstating  still the man  actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the nl this year did not pitch in the majors last year  huh  imo this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the  other expansion drafts had since the talent was diluted over both leagues in gammons defense because the talent drain came from the al as well some increase will be seen  he also gets credit for mentioning that the 0000 jump in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 0000 season  hes still full of it                 kurt bose as in daisy not rose  kboscarinaunmedu if you take out all the fks this is an 00 page book    wally backman leafing though a copy of mets teammate lenny dykstras      autobiography nails

000  000      maj       000  000  00   0  00   00   00  00    this is what jackson looked like in 0000 with everything converted  to a neutral park on the basis of run production his equivalent  average started at 000 in 00 was up to 000 in 00 and 000 in 00 so  let us say he had established in his last two seasons a 000 level  of play  im not quite sure how these numbers are generated  it appears that in a neutral park bos hr and slugging tend to drop he actually loses two home runs  or do they  what is equivalent average  one thing when looking at bos stats is that you can see that kc took away some homers  normally you expect some wouldbe homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks or to be caught and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway  but bo despite his speed  hit very few doubles and not that many triples  so i would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park     that is good very good in fact but it probably doesnt make the top  ten in the league the 00th best eqa in the al in 0000 was dave  winfields 000 thomas was first at 000 first in the nl was bonds  an incroyable 000 tenth was bip roberts 000 but 000 is better  than any season in the past five years by joe carter it is about what  mattingly had in 0000 000 what felix jose had the last two years  just ahead of time raines fiveyear average better than ryan  kleskos mles   felix jose has been a 000000 player in a fairly neutral park i would offhand guess the 0000 bo at around a 000000 player maybe 000000   not even close   he got more attention from the media than was warranted from his  baseball playing though his hype was a lot better than his hitting  that is the basis for the netcomments about him being overrated the  media would have you beleive he was a great hitter i think he was a  good maybe very good hitter he was imo something like the 00th best  hitter in the majors  id put him about there too    note i hadnt realized the media had hyped him so much  i thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player and only soso  at baseball  he did only have one 00hr 000rbi season and kc wasnt winning  note 0 i maybe have harped on this a bit in the past but there is a mistake being made by the sdcns as they are known on this group with respect to players like bo and deion and lofton and perhaps others  we find that if you look at a large group of players their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well their are some caveats the younger they are the less good the prediction the lower the minor league the less good i imagine the more recent the player has left college ball etc  now of course this prediction involves quite a bit of error  sometimes a player with poor mles dave justice the 0000 ventura becomes a star some hitters develop shane mack brian downing some dont oddibe mcdowell mickey brantley  this error involves real things there are real reasons why oddibe didnt hit and shane did  it may who knows involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on  but still you have this big pool of players and things work pretty well one of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players  one thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them or almost all have spent a good deal of time playing ball  their backgrounds are similar  what hasnt been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background  is there some reason to believe that a bo or a deion or a lofton or a tony gwynn  or an ainge or so on has such a different background that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly  it hasnt been established that you can use mles with twosport players it hasnt been established that you cant but then statistics is after all an art  i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about bo and deion and lofton look at those goodbutnotgreat minor league numbers they say  well what happens if those numbers simply dont mean what they usually mean it might mean that ken lofton suddenly has a better year in houston than tuscon  it might mean that deion suddenly has a better halfyear in atlanta than greenville    then again it might not  ken and deion might go right back in the tank this year live up to those poor mles  but you guys dont know  whats  worse you dont know that you dont  and you dont know that there are  other players you wont know about  injuries and lifting and wheaties  again  you seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal  its not its got some error  oh well  bill guilford  still thinks hairy butt is truly ugly might be right

  mssnetcomcom mark singer said  we know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball    yes  but this is irrelevant  youre talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on  i might as well say we know that very very few people are more than 0 feet tall so chances are that manute bol is really only 0 foot 0  no  maybe i need to improve my writing skills  lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age 00 having not played at aaa level that it is probably not a good idea to rush him into the braves lineup in 0000  why isnt lopez likely to hit that well  he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did  by a lot  as for rushing  if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i dont believe there is then wouldnt you rather waste lopezs 00year old good season than his 00year old very good season or his 00yearold excellent season  the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use  lopez was hitting 000 over 00 ab when he was cut from spring training  what does he have to do to earn a chance  maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth  gee  i dont know  00 abs sounds pretty good to me  about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a backup role rather than start every day at aaa  talk about me as a gm  the point was not that 00 ab is a significant sample but rather that he hadnt done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up  ok  most players are not ready for the bigs at age 00   most players are never ready for the bigs  what does this have to do with javy lopez  most players  benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa  see above    most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs  those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year  but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds  most players arent that good so they probably wont be that good this year either  now  the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners    and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble  not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans  not superstars not stars not even good players  maybe average if were being charitable  the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops    ummm  justice is a very fine hitter  pendleton might have another big year in his bat but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell  gant is a big question mark  the breamhunter platoon is decent not excellent and has rotten obp or slg depending on whos in  blauser is a very valuable bat for a shortstop   the center field platoon will probably hit 000  however good lopez bat might be given the above it wont be so much better than what they have to offset the differential in experience and  defensive ability    wanna bet  the difference between lopezs bat and olsonberryhill could be 00 or 00 runs over the course of the season  given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play ill take the latter every time  the kid will improve playing at aaa   just like keith mitchell did  i am just so surprised i have to spell all of this out  my  goodness  do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential  that was me and you so far your only counterproposal is that they really dont understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two  i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization  are they idiots who have built this ballclub    wellargued but inflammatory reply deleted       david m tate     i do not know what it is about you that closes   posing as        and opens only something in me understands    e e can         the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete roses      dy cummings   nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands  
  mssnetcomcom mark singer said in article 0000bluecispittedu geneticpittedu david m tate writes  well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there  but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion    catcher is their weakest position with the possible exception of second base they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a wellaboveaverage offensive player and acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team and they want to play olson and berryhill instead  i disagree in that i dont think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership is  i dont deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but i really dont see any way that we could ever know who they are  nicholss law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously  sorry  new  dont know nichols law    a catchers defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his  recent offensive level of performance  thus mickey tettleton goes in  the media from being a nohit defensive whiz to a slugging thumbfinger  in two short years  the rule doesnt apply to perceived superstars who  get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead  greg olson is probably  considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he cant hit   dont believe in catchers era  but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers  arent they the same thing  in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind  a different decision than we would make must be financial    either that or just stupidity  i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no  of course  is it fair to the young players  no  does it make organizational sense  i think it does  well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions  i mean please dont tell me how to run my business  especially when im being successful  one could make the same sort of argument in other cases  pete rose in pursuing ty cobbs record was a huge gate attraction and national media magnet  the reds made a lot of money off that they also wasted the prime of eric davis  that may be good business but that doesnt mean i dont loathe them for it        david m tate     i do not know what it is about you that closes   posing as        and opens only something in me understands    e e can         the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete roses      dy cummings   nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands

  well maddux looked excellent as the braves shutout the cubs 0  0 justice drove in the only run with an rbi single in the first get ready for him to have a monster year he is now hitting the ball to the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural  power to right field and his good batting eye if he stays healthy which he should his back is full strength this year he should get over 000 rbi and close to 00 hr  in another note the marlins got off to a good start beating the dodgers i believe the score was 0  0 but im not sure i wish them and the rockies well this year hell i think it would be funny to watch the dodgers hit the cellar again this year  dan smith

     whenever a person is put on the 00day 00day or 00day   the person is on the list longer than the specificed time    ive seen a person on the 00day for maybe 0 months last year i dont  remember what   i just need a little clarification on the disabled list specifications  i believe we are down to two  the 00day and the 00day  i dont remember  a 00day but rather a 00day  anyways its gone now  the period length  is a minimum not a maximum  you can keep a guy on the 00day for as long  as you want if hes still certified as injured  the player must be  periodically reevaluated to determine if hes still injured thus you  cannot park a player on the dl who maybe is out of options and you do not  wish to expose to waivers  if you get someone qualified for the 00day  that reduces the frequency of reevaluations  there is no longer i  believe any limit to the number of players you can place on the dl  when  there was you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between  the lists king sparky banaianno taxes  no new taxes kbanaianpitzerclaremonteduno old taxes we are taxed dept of economics pitzer collegeenough  rep alan keyes latest 0000 gdp forecast  00 please run alan

   your speculation and  others that lopez will produce better than the two proven veterans is nothing more than speculation no matter how well founded  your speculation that the two proven veterans will produce better than lopez is also no more than speculation  it does make a difference whether the speculation is wellfounded or not    obviously the braves believe they can win with the catching they have and i agree  if they change their minds theyll call up lopez  though this is a good point  the one speculation is safer because it can be reversed  cheers valentine

  since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx 00 posts going back to the braves could be better off if an injury happens i may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame  0  back at the beginning of spring training i though lopez would make the squad easily  olson was still recovering from his lateseason injury knee i believe and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before june  and then berryhill was dinged up  i was looking forward to this because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position  before last season he was the braves defensive catcher prospect while brian deak was the braves offensive catcher prospect  besides olson and berryhill couldnt hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and dont walk enough to be useful  but olson recovered quickly berryhill recovered and the braves went with the two vets  i still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season he wouldnt have gotten his job back  0  there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around after all ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear  there are teams out there without one average ml catcher california and seattle come to mind  certainly trying to move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work plus youd have to eat that salary which isnt huge but isnt tiddleywinks either i think olsons at about 000000 berryhill at 000000 but thats only what i recall  0  yes i think arbitrationeligibility may have a role to play in this also  what is it that 00 of the 0year players arent eligible for arbitration   only the 00 that were on the roster the longest are eligible  of course the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet known  from a business standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until junethe first time olsonberryhill go on the dl  0  i am still disappointed that lopez isnt on the team i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves and the truth is that id rather see our best team on the field which imo includes lopez  of coursetoday we play the cubs  hopefully we wont need him   as for the schuerholzcox conversation i imagine it went like this  remember theyve both been gms the following is not meant to be read by the humorimpaired  cox  ok weve sent jones down  his fielding could be a little smoother  besides blauser can hit ok and his fielding is better than it used to be  schuerholz  well well have to send nieves down too  deion just wont sign that baseball only contract  we cant count on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the defense  besides gormans not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet  once hatchers gone and deion signs we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez  that ought to give us some pitching depth in 0000  cox  yep thatll be nice  too bad deion wont sign ok ill look for nieves when justice starts having berryberryer back problems again  now what about klesko  schuerholz  well weve still got to fork out another 00 mil for bream  if we keep klesko we either lose the money or cabrera  i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he doesnt seem to be the same gm  first jeffries for jose and now whiten for clark  if he gets rid of brian jordan then id have to believe that he and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings  cox  ok keep trying on bream and ill wait til the trading deadline for my hunterklesko platoon  maybe i can get a few extra atbats for cabrera while we wait  try california if snow starts slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid and if that doesnt work then perhaps sids knees could be persuaded to act up  theres always the 00day dl  mwahahahaha  schuerholz  what about caraballo  cox  well hes not that much better than lemke  maybe if he starts in richmond hell start walking more  besides if hes going to be arbitrationeligible better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks  schuerholz  now lets see  that leaves lopez  cox  nooooo  i gotta keep lopez  sure i didnt think olson would recover this quickly  maybe i can talk caminiti into running into him again  schuerholz  nope lopez has gotta go  you know that hell get 0 million in arbitration  may as well put it off that one extra year  besides until olsons shown his stuff a little bit i cant trade him  besides berryhills a lefthanded hitter  you know how rare that is  cox  dont you mean a lefthanded whiffer  pretty common if you ask me  i mean he made pat borders look good in the world series  pat borders  schuerholz  hey youre the one who wouldnt write lopez into the lineup  cox  well youre the one who went out and got me jeff reardon  besides i thought lopez wouldnt be used to our pitching staffs stuff  he got some time with them this springlooked pretty good  come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate  schuerholz  yeah but which stiff  whichever one we keep will be hurt by may  cox  ok ok you made your point  keep them both  surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest  then i can call up lopez and then we can win 000 games  the pennant the world series  ill be up there with john mcgraw  casey stengel  earl weaver  oh they laughed at me in toronto but have you ever had to deal with george bell  ill finally get my just reward  mwahahaha  schuerholz  easy bobby  have you been taking those happy pills left around by chuck tanner  whyd you ever hire that guy anyhow  cox  dont ask me ask ted   eric

   speaking of the marlins winning the opener    based on lifetime percentage of games won who has the second best   record  in baseball history soon to be the best record again      if i had to guess i would be forced to say the yankees  on the other   hand  the blue jays might be up there too    hmmmmm    tony  blue jays no way hell but the yankees probably do remember the yankees   had the best record of any team in the 00s and probably take the 00s   through 00s as well

  how many runs will be scored in denver i dont know  but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in  mile high stadium during the last few years of the bearszephyrs  tenure in the american association  heres the total runs scored per game in zephyrs games  all league games and the ratio i found the same ratios for hr  year  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio    0000 0000  000 000   000 000 000 0000  000  000 000   000 000 000 0000 0000  000 000   000 000 000 0000  000  000 000   000 000 000 0000  000  000 000   000 000 000 0000 0000 0000 000   000 000 000 0000  000  000 000   000 000  00 0000  000  000 000   000 000 000 0000  000  000 000   000 000  00 0000 0000  000 000   000 000 000 0000 0000 0000 000   000 000 000 0000 0000  000 000   000 000  00 0000 0000  000 000   000 000 000       000000000     000000000  it seems pretty clear that denver will have a large effect  on runs scored ill stick with my prediction from last year  that itll be one of the top 0 in the nl this year  and a fairly large effect on homeruns  though apparently not as large as  atlanta wrigley cincinnati and san diego still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park  john rickert rickertnextworkrosehulmanedu

  mssnetcomcom mark singer said in article 0000bluecispittedu geneticpittedu david m tate writes mssnetcomcom mark singer said  we know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball    yes  but this is irrelevant  youre talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on  do you really have that much information on him  really  i dont personally but clay just posted it  yes we do    unfortunately it shows that lopez wasnt as good an example as nieves would have been since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous years which i didnt have access to  the point remains though knowing a guys minor league history is as good as knowing his major league history if you know how to read it  why isnt lopez likely to hit that well  he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did  by a lot  i dont know  you tell me  what percentage of players reach or  exceed their mles in their rookie season  were talking about 0000 you know  the mle is not a projection its an equivalence  its a this is how well he hit last year in major league terms rating  so in essence he has already reached it  i would guess bob  clay that essentially half of all players surpass their previous mles in their rookie seasons  maybe more than half since all of these players are young and improving  if that were your purpose maybe  offerman spent 0000 getting  acclimated if you will  the dodgers as a team paid a big price that season    did they  offerman may have been the difference between 0th or 0th place and last place but no more  perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road do you really think they would have done what they did if they were competing for a pennant  sure they didnt have anyone better  i suppose they might have gutted the farm system to acquire jay bell or spike owen or somebody if they were really in contention   the point was not that 00 ab is a significant sample but rather that he hadnt done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up  for a stathead im amazed that you put any credence in spring training    if youd read what i wrote youd be less amazed  nowhere do i claim to put any credence in spring training  quite the contrary i said that lopez hadnt done anything that even the bozos who do put credence in spring training could interpret as failure  just because i think spring training numbers are meaningless doesnt mean that bobby cox does its just a case of ruling out one possible explanation for sending lopez down  the kid will improve playing at aaa   just like keith mitchell did  wait a minute  i missed something here    keith mitchell did very very well at aa aaa and the majors over a season then did very very poorly for a year in aaa       david m tate     i do not know what it is about you that closes   posing as        and opens only something in me understands    e e can         the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete roses      dy cummings   nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands

  most of this discussion has been between mark singer and david tate with valentine weighing in on the same side as dave at various times my opinion fwiw to all  mark age doesnt matter ability does i would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best i dont care if he is 00 if he plays better than what i have i want him out there sandy alomar had decent minor league numbers grossly inflated by the pcl in general and las vegas in particular he should have been projected as an average major league hitter which is good for a catcher ill admit santiagos numbers would probably come out the same as sandys but i dont have the league data from the mid00s to check it out  that being said i agree with sending lopez to richmond at least to start the season as the box below shows he has one minor league season in which he hit well he has two in which he hit very very poorly i want to see that the 00 lopez is real olson and berryhill are not complete mediocrities for catchers especially nl catchers they are essentially average hitters with equivalent averages around 000 if he had hit well at prior levels i would say he belongs on the braves but there is a reasonable chance that lopez last year was just as much a fluke as alomar in 00 or santiago in 00 one year at any level at any age doesnt satisfy my standards of evidence      javier lopez 0000            0000 bur    000  000  00   0   0    0    0   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 dur    000   00   0   0   0   00    0   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 grn    000  000  00   0  00   00    0   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 atl     00    0   0   0   0    0    0   0  000    0  000  000  000     maj        00    0   0   0   0    0    0   0  000    0  000  000  000     min      0000  000  00   0  00   00   00   0  000  000  000  000  000     tot      0000  000  00   0  00   00   00   0  000  000  000  000  000     maj       000  000  00   0   0    0    0   0     min       000  000  00   0  00   00    0   0     tot       000  000  00   0  00   00    0   0  on a similar note i dont understand why more people are not supportive of neon deion granted i thought his behavior with mccarver last year was completely bush last year was the first time he ever got 000 ab in one place so his lines are hard to read but he has a combined 000 ops in minor league play with his speed is more valuable than the ops alone indicates and at a still young age 00 had a monster year with an 000 ops he has a total major and minor eqa of 000 above major league average and above average for cf which was about 000 in the nl last year he has shown at least the potential of going into the 000s which would make him one of the 00 best hitters in the league he has two full seasons before reaching his prime season of 00 he should be considered as a legitimate prospect and not as a simple sideshow attraction        deion sanders 0000         0000 fla     00    0   0   0   0    0    0   0  000    0  000  000  000   0000 int     00    0   0   0   0    0    0   0  000    0  000  000  000   0000 eas    000   00   0   0   0    0   00   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 nyy     00   00   0   0   0    0    0   0  000    0  000  000  000   0000 int    000   00  00   0   0   00   00   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 nyy    000   00   0   0   0   00    0   0  000    0  000  000  000   0000 int     00   00   0   0   0   00    0   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 atl    000   00   0   0   0   00   00   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 ric    000   00   0   0   0    0   00   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 atl    000   00  00  00  00   00   00   0  000   00  000  000  000     maj       000  000  00  00  00   00   00  00  000   00  000  000  000     min       000  000  00   0  00   00   00  00  000   00  000  000  000     tot      0000  000  00  00  00  000   00  00  000  000  000  000  000     maj       000  000  00  00  00   00   00  00     min       000  000  00   0  00   00   00  00     tot       000  000  00  00  00   00   00  00  clay d

  did anyone notice the words not for baseball printed on the picture of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa today any reason given for this  also i just noticed something looking at the nolan ryan timeline in the preview on 00000 rickey henderson became nolans 0000th strikeout on 00000 he pitched his 0th nohitter against oakland i believe the last out in the game was made by rickey henderson and on 0000 nolan pitched his 0th nohitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 000th base which overshadowed it it seems that nolan is having a lot of publicity at rickeys expense imo rickey deserves it and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what ive seen on it lately they are both great players but imo nolan has outclassed rickey both in playing and more importantly in attitude just my thoughts  kevin  
  as for rushing  if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i dont believe there is then wouldnt you rather waste lopezs 00year old good season than his 00year old very good season or his 00yearold excellent season  the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use  can anybody name a player who was rushed to the majors lets for arguments sake define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 00 or younger and performing below expectations whose career was damaged by this rushing  im serious i tend to agree with david that bringing the player up sooner is better but id like to look at players for whom this theory didnt work if there are any  id prefer players within the last 00 years or so because then i can look up their minor league stats  its important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected as opposed to players who were hyped and failed but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers    lets kick it off with an example of a player who was rushed although there doesnt seem to have been any damage to his career  jay bell was given 000 pas in the major leagues at age 00 and performed well below what you would expect from his aaa numbers the same season  he got 000 pas the next year at age 00 and still underperformed  however the next year at age 00 his performance improved and he won the everyday shortstop job and has been there ever since  its really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league where he was performed quite well in aaa during this time rather than being rushed cleveland might have been better off i suppose because they might have been less likely to give up on him  yes if you bring a player up early hes likely going to struggle  but does that delay the time at which he stops struggling and starts performing up to expectations  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

  snicholsadobecom sherri nichols writes  can anybody name a player who was rushed to the majors lets for arguments sake define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 00 or younger and performing below expectations whose career was damaged by this rushing   i tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues the braves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis as they had little talent on their roster for some time  steve avery for example was rushed to the majors and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign his subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 0 era during his rookie year  bill james pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound  bob horner was also rushed to the majors out of arizona state directly had good numbers immediately  i am not certain of the ages of people like pete smith craig mcmurty and derek lilliquist  the braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed  lilliquist and smith struggled but it didnt hurt ps and dl may have been overhyped  i seem to recall cm pitching well initially though i dont have stats handy  douglas boneinternet bonelucianostanfordedu standard disclaimersbitnet   bonelucianostanfordedustanford applyuucp   ucbvaxlucianosierrastanfordedubone  
  stay in school  you have a lot to learn  learn what  i know that 0 million dollars is a lot of money  i know  rickey henderson doesnt have a career out of baseball  i know if he  didnt have baseball he wouldnt be making near the money he is now  i just dont understand how some athlete who only plays a sport for a  living for millions of dollars say he is not being paid enough  if nobody will sign him for his asking price he will be the one hurting the as will still win without him  remeber many of these athletes have nothing if not for their athletic  ability  nothing  they are getting paid much more than most hard working citizens and they are complaining of not enough pay  i dont have a problem with them making millions  my problem is when the say they arent being paid enough when they already get 0 millionalso their numbers get worse

  mssnetcomcom mark singer said   most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs  those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year  now  the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners    this is the crux of the argument to me at least  both the sdcn and the nonsdcn camps seem to agree on the fact that a catchers defense is basically nonmeasurable at present  you can talk about how important calling a game is or framing the pitches or blocking balls in the dirt  but there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catchers rank in defense    looking at lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the braves or the media has labeled him a bad defensive catcher  as far as i can tell he doesnt have any particular problem in his mechanics such as sasser  he might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time  i cant see how repetitions at aaa are any better then reps in the majors    all were left with is the calling the game aspect  olsen  and berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff  but this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers  how is catching at aaa going to help lopez learn the major league pitching staff  the only way any catcher is going to learn tom glavines pitches is to catch tom glavine  similarly i wouldnt be supprised if the pitchers claimed to prefer pitching to olsen over pitching to lopez because they are used to pitching to olsen  but  given time they will say they are comfortable with lopez  now since lopez cant learn how to handle the major league pitchers while hes in aaa and since he doesnt have any glaring problem in his mechanics what is he going to learn in aaa that he cant learn just as well while in the majors    dave  dave bonar mebonarlsuvaxsncclsuedu

  driftwood writes    i totally agree with each point you made  jose viscaino looked  like a single a hitter up there  who swings on 00 count with maddux   pitching and your teams down by a run and you havent touched the ball  all   day  i also think too much is made of that leftyrighty thing   watching  the cubs games i get the feeling steve stone knows a lot more about  what  the cubs should be doing than lefebre does  harry said it best when he  stated after another terrible vizcaino at bat we cant wait til  sandberg returns  i tell you steve stone is like a prophet he must be making a ton in the boradcoast booth because i cant understand why hes not actually back in the game itself  the other day he called sosas homerun against the sox and claimed the game would be going into extra innings when the score was 00 in the 0th  so yesterday he notices that sosas ahead in the count against maddux and says this is a fastball situation and sosa will be looking for it  but this is also the spot where maddux throws the straight change   sure enough sosa gets ahead on it and pops it up to the infield  stoney for cubs manager  rick  
  now keith mitchell  as i recall no stat books handy  surprise he jumped from aa to atlanta in 0000  he did so well that he was returned to the minors where he didnt do very well at all  now his career is in jeopardy  so how does he fit in with your  point  good mles in aa  moved him right to the big club  now hes one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball duh  methinks you recall wrong mitchell hit close to 000 in atlanta and  continued to walk alot after his promotion he was then i think left off the playoff roster and started the next year in the minors where even the braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad at going back down   he struggled last year no doubt but even the braves blamed part of it on the demotion id much rather have mitchell than say mark whiten on the cards     russ smith  i dont know anything about xs but i know about some o                                 george gervin on being an assistant coach

   and michael jackson jack nicholson and bill cosby wouldnt be  making near as much money if they werent entertainers so whats your point  actually i could care less what his salary is  it has something to do with the fact that we live in america and everyone is entitled to whatever he can legally obtain  if sandy alderson and the haas family willingly negotiate a salary of 00 million per year with rickey i couldnt care less  but what really gets my goat is the bullshit he spouted in spring training about well sometimes i may not play as hard or might be hurt more often in a place where im not appreciated  this quote was in the chronicle about the second week of camp and strongly suggests that he was going to  dog it all year if the ownership didnt kiss his butt and ante up some more money  for gods sake rickey you signed a contract 0 years ago now honor it and play    say all you want to about steve garvey and believe me i hated him too but at least when he put his signature on a piece of paper he shut his mouth and played hard until the contract was up  matt bohnert

   i was watching the dodgersmarlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me    first is that the way the sun was shining in miami it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball  in comparison wrigley field in early april still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans    the second and most important was the fans  i like these guysgals i will admit i am a football fan first but i still enjoy baseball it was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the miami dolphins  the way they were cheering i thought it was the afc playoffs  of course opening day may have a lot to do with it but i really got feeling of electricity that i think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities    baseball certainly needs a charge and i hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement  well find out friday how denver bronco fans respond   phillies are 00 i better say it now before my opportunity passes by  
   i personally will never forget mike schmidts home run against the expos in 0000 that decided the nl east  it was also his career high 00th   another home run that i thought was totally incredible was in the 0000 alcs  the ca angles had the boston red sox 0 strike away from the pennant until don baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run that was the most incredible turn of events i have ever seen in baseball  the sox later took the pennant away only to have the same thing done to them in the ws against the mets  speaking of the mets isnt it strange how the nlcs that year with the astros almost mirrored the 0000 nlcs with the phillies  the astros have been painfully close twice i must admit    
   this talk about the phillies winning the nl east is scary  very scary  dont get me wrong im a phillies fan but as late as last year they looked helpless  the funny thing was they did have a lot of injuries in 00 spring training that basically killed their chances  of course dont forget the dykstra wrist injury in the first or second game     
   after reading my local paper today i found out that the phillies started the 0000 season at 000  i am not as old as 0000 but ive heard many talk about the serious choke job the phillies did that season they were ahead of the cardinals by 00 games that season in midaugust  they managed to lose a bunch from then on and the cardinals took the division  00 games ahead and lost it i hope this season is much different

   in article 0000adobecom snicholsadobecom sherri nichols writes every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball being 00 offense 00 defense  a run scored is just as important as a run prevented     this certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any  statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what  percent is fielding  id really like to know  btw sherri thanks for   the da data i find it fascinating  of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented just as a penny saved is a penny earned  enough with the cliches my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to their potential they wont need much offensive support i realize this is a big if  this staff leaves the 00 bosox in the dust there is no legitimate comparison  two cy young winners and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter  it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs  the team that scores the most  runs wins  this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs  a low  scoring game would clearly benefit the braves  they should have many  low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting on the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers they would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent  the name of the games is to win  even ray knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard all im trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the braves have the offense doesnt need to be as strong   sam    dave     sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

  says  what i think is hotdogish about his abs is the way he leans out over the plate to watch outside pitches etc this not done to get a better look at the pitch but to make it seemthis ball is so far out i need to lean just to get near it so you better call it a ball this is my unbiased opinion of what i see your mileage will vary rickey is agreat player to watch if you forget who he is at the time  a lot of batters lean in when pitches come  rickeys crouch tends to exaggerate that i think  a great player to watch if you forget who he is  unbiased hmmm  bob vesterman

  rogers is the onebatter lefty in the bullpen  dusty has also said he trusts rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where beck is unavailable so you might see a couple of saves for kevin  then again if any of the regular rotation falters rogers is a possible candidate to start though this would appear less likely now that dave burba did well in an emergency start  steven  
  joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball  for anyone who didnt see sundays game  with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers  later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a 000 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea a 000 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  what the hell is he thinking  earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said he liked gilkey coming off the bench  gilkey hit over 000 last year what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every team in the league  furthermore in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate  the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home   i cant take this anymore  brian a very distressed cardinal fan    brian landmann                                             georgia institute of technology                            internetgt0000aprismgatechedu

   and now the not so pleasant surprises  0tartabull the book on tartabull was keep him healthy and   hell produce well he hasnt done too much so far sure hes   hit a few homers but those were all solo shots and he hasnt   gotten any of the big rbis that your cleanup man is supposed   to give you then again he had a slow start last year once he   got off the dl that is and turned into a oneman wrecking crew see you in the series  alan   lets see april 00th less than 00 at bats and you claim that he  hasnt done too much so far  cut this guy some slack danny will produce this year its scary to think just how much hell produce if he were to stay healthy all year  the yanks have a lot going for them this year good starting rotation good bullpen good defense and a good lineup also i like buck showalter frank howard on 0st is also a good move everything sounds good so far   if the yanks stay healthy they have a good chance at winning the pennant this  is the most fun ive had watching the yanks since 00  bobby

continued at essentially the expected pace  the brewers and indians cranked in the second half  the rangers predictably took a dive  that shouldnt have surprised anybody  meanwhile as predicted the mariners dropped behind the angels and royals  they clearly didnt deserve the 0000 record in june  the white sox and as upped their game a bit while the twins dropped off a little  but for the most part things were as expected  okay so there were a few blatant errors  but for a predictive calculation i thought this did pretty well   from cavgeoeyalevmyccyaleedu tue mar 00 000000 0000 0 the braves insert kent mercker into the starting rotation sometime this year 0000  bielecki is traded or released lei brandt becomes the fifth starter and the best bullpen in baseball has pena berenguer stanton wohlers freeman and pete smith who spotstarts as well  hm  pete smith made the rotation instead of mercker  and bielecki wasnt released until the end of the year  i wont comment on the bullpen  jeff reardon    0 blauser wins the starting shortstop job outright by the end of may  bream goes on the dl and klesko goes on a nice hitting honeymoon a la gregg jefferies in 0000 platooning with hunter mitchell wins the center field job a bit later allstar break and nixon stays on as a valuable pinchrunner  lonnie is released unless the braves find a taker in a trade  right on blauser  wrong on bream and mitchell  a bit early on lonnie as with bielecki  didnt pick sanders  did anybody   0 managers to be fired this year 0000 in chronological order fregosi showalter valentine riddoch  three

from tedward tue mar 00 000000 0000  hmph  can tell you are a mets fan  do you mind if i make some counter predictions against yours  they follow 0 mets come in third behind pittsburgh and montreal  okay so the mets finished fifth  but i got the pirates and expos right  0 the yankees offense and pitching flounders dropping them to fourth    place in the al east  boston wins 00 games the division the pennant    and the world series  first half  dead on  second half  ummm  im a sox fan go easy on me  0 dwight gooden rushes his comeback gets blown out and goes on the dl from    may through midjuly    saberhagen runs a 000 record wfan criticizes the mets for giving away    that great talent jefferies who has a solid year in kc  so i got my predictions for gooden and saberhagen reversed    i was at least close and was right about jefferies  though i dont know  has wfan criticized the jefferies trade  0 roger clemens wins another cy as well as 00 games  close  no cigar     excerpts from

tedwardcscornelledu do you care to put your prediction down for posterity  you predict mark grace will get 00 rbis  i say you are out of your mind  that is almost impossible for a 00hr type guy batting behind dawson  who kills most of the rallies he doesnt finish  why do you say that mark has driven in 00 00 and 00 00 last year mark was batting second primarily and it was his worse year average wise since he is batting either 0rd or 0th this year i predict  he will be back up to his previous standards i think he will be better 00 rbis is not that much of a stretch  sometimes us statheads get lucky  grace didnt hit behind dawson the entire season but he also finished with only 00 rbis    from nss0midwayuchicagoedu tue may 00 000000 0000  the most ballsy prediction ever  mark mcgwire will hit 00 or more hrs this year  nope  he slowed down and the injury finished him off  didnt even reach 00  but a ballsy prediction nonetheless    from ecaxronmarslercnasagov thu may 00 000000 0000 0 baltimore will not fade  they will not win the division this year     but they will finish within five games  i find the prospect of two     orioles winning 00 each easier to comprehend than that of two sox     no offense  i think their pitching is about as good as the division     has to offer  the orioles finished seven games out  none of them won 00 though mussina might have had a chance with better relief and more starts  0 nobody else in the division is worth a darn  they all finish a minimum     of fifteen games out the tribe 00  thats another reason to watch     baltimore this year and next  they wont waste many of those games      against the rest of the division  except for the brewers who you probably forgot you were right  the rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre  the yankees and indians led with 00 wins the red sox trailed with 00 wins  none were horrible but four were five or more games below 000   date thu 0 aug 0000 000000 gmt  right  that was me  i never said the jays were a cinch to clinch it but i said that milwaukee will be more of a threat than baltimore  i do think that toronto should win it but after 00 i dont consider anything a cinch unless you have something like a 0 game lead with 0 games to go  i do think that the jays have the best talented team in the al east and if we had a good or even average manager we might have a bigger lead right now  i also think that the orioles will not play much better than 000 baseball for the rest of the season  you win    from kingcogsciucsdedu thu nov 00 000000 0000  in article

stvjasmeteorwiscedu fri sep 00 000000 0000  0 jose rijo will win the 0000 cy young award if he is healthy enough to go at least 000 ip who would have thought he would try to steal a base why risk such an injury  he had 000 ip but didnt win the cy young  maddux surprised all  0 the orioles will win 00 games in at least 0 of the next 0 years probably the last 0 and their pitching staff will have a team era among the best 0 in the al in at least 0 of the next 0 years but not necessarily all the same years as they win 00 this one will take a long time to verify  i dont think i want to wait that long  but they won 00 games last year and they were fifth in the league in era  not a bad start  0 ben mcdonald will not challenge for an era title in the next 0 years nor will he have 00 victories either year by challenge i mean finish among the leaders being among the leaders before the season is done doesnt count  he will probably never be the pitcher he was hyped to be but is still a decent starter to have  looks like it  he wasnt bad last year just too consistent to be an ace  so far this year looks like more of the same  0 the phillies will give up many fewer walks ifwhen they get rid of their bullpen coach ryan i am not predicting when or whether they will get rid of him and you will have to give the team a little bit of time to adjust  before seeing the radical change they would have a fine pitching staff if  they would just steal ray miller away from pittsburg the white sox seem to have the same problem but not as bad  i honestly cant say  did they get rid of him  their bb totals were down last year  0 ricky jordan will have 00 rbi if he starts 000 games hitting in the 0 or 0 or 0 spot in any lineup or the 0 spot in a lineup with very good obp in the 00 hitters this applies for each of the next 0 years  i just dont think hes that good  00 billy ripken will never again hit over 000 with 000 ab    so far so good  im definitely not waiting to check this one    from panixspiracmcl0nyuedu fri sep 00 000000 0000  no matter what lou gorman and his scouts say paul quantrill will never ever be an adequate major league starter  never  i have never seen a starting pitcher who can only strike out 0 per 0 innings at aaa be successful in the majors  current plans seem to be to use quantrill in long relief  he has a rubber arm and unusual delivery  he might be decent in that role    from lyleecnpurdueedu sat sep 00 000000 0000       mvp  00 al  frank thomas nl  hal morris        division winners  00 al east  baltimore orioles al west  chicago white sox al

offer a similar salary to an obviously declining but above average shortstop who had a career year one full season ago  of course if cal does match his 00 numbers then eli is going to be faced with a rather huge and expensive problem  how much did cal sign for  when did he sign  if i remember correctly he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season    and finally  from jpalmeruwovaxuwoca thu sep 00 000000 0000  generally because of expansion in 0000 there will be a lot of mediocre talent hanging around much of it will not make it as the expansion teams look for younger talent around which to build their teams my specific predictions  as of april 0 0000  jim acker and cory snider will be selling aluminum siding  snyder is still in sf  acker is gone  neither charlie kerfeld nor vance lovelace presently in tiger aa but formerly big leaguers will be playing professional ball  they arent in the majors  nor will dave rozema who says hes keeping in shape with a hope for another shot with expansion  never heard of him  shawn hare and jody hurst will be in the major leagues they are outfielders in the tiger minor league system  i dont think they are in the majors  ron hassey will be a minor league manager with the yankees  dunno what happened to him  it will be byebye for balboni  if hes still around hes stuck in the minors  bo jackson will not be a starter  hm  with raines out bo looks to get a lot of pt  gary huckaby will have moved to alaska permanently theyre on the net     and dave kirsch will return to canada to live  hm    thanks for listening valentine  
   why are the red sox in first place  eight games into the season they already have two wins each from clemens and viola  clemens starts again tonight on three days rest  whats up  are the sox going with a fourman rotation  is this why hesketh was used in relief last night  hm  cheers valentine ps i was wrong  the sox have already scored 00 runs in two games this week  they should reach 00 without trouble  i still think its a fluke  
  sbp000acaddrakeedu said   in article 0000adobecom snicholsadobecom sherri nichols writes every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball being 00 offense 00 defense  a run scored is just as important as a run prevented    of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented just as a penny saved is a penny earned  enough with the cliches  its not a cliche and unlike your comments below its not a tautology it neednt have been true  if every pitcher in baseball were essentially the same in quality ie if the variance of pitching ability were much smaller than the variance of batting ability then scoring runs would be much more important than preventing them simply because the ability to actively prevent runs would be much weaker  my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to their potential they wont need much offensive support  if thats your point you should have said so  what you in fact said was pitching and defense win championships and later pitching is the essence of baseball  neither of which says what you are now claiming was your  point and neither of which is true  it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs  the team that scores the most  runs wins    and you accuse sherri of mouthing cliches  this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs  a low  scoring game would clearly benefit the braves    its not clear to me at all that this is true  in highscoring games the team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time  in low scoring games the split is essentially 0000 regardless of team ability  they should have many  low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting on the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers  i thought you said pitching and defense win championships and pitching is the essence of baseball         david m tate   dtatepittedu   greetings sir with bat not quick       member iie orsa tims sabr      hands not soft eye not discerning                                        and in denver they call you a slugger    the big catullus galarraga        and compare you to my own mattingly

  from another notsodistressedbutstillwonderingaboutafewthings cardinal fan  joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball  hes not the greatest  this is true  for anyone who didnt see sundays game  i saw it  with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers  lankford was hurt although the announcer said he told torre he could pinch hit if they needed him to  later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a 000 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea a 000 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  what the hell is he thinking  i wondered the same thing  but giving joe the benefit of the  doubt id say he was thinking that lankford is hurt enough that he didnt trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his speed on the bases so pinch run him  alicea i was completely confused about  maybe he had a good record hitting against that particular pitcher  i dont know  anybody got an idea  earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said he liked gilkey coming off the bench  gilkey hit over 000 last year what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every team in the league  well so far i havent seen much to say whiten shouldnt be playing but it is too bad that gilkey is the odd man out when they play  jordan ahead of him  that i dont quite understand  furthermore in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate  the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home   yup i looked for this on the replay too  if im joe torre im going to have a talk with bucky after the game on that one  hes got lankford at third with todd zeile i believe  a hot hitter   coming up  theres no reason to risk giving lankford the go sign  in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands   its his job to watch the play develop  he should have known larkin  was there to back up a bad throw  that seemed inexcusable in my book   btw i saw dent do the same thing last year with zeile rounding third  and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation  on the  replay theres dent waving him around  it looks like this might be a  serious problem  the cards werent good base runners at all last year  and i wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching   i cant take this anymore  well im still hanging in there  go redbirds  woof woof  brian a very distressed cardinal fan    brian landmann                                             georgia institute of technology                            internetgt0000aprismgatechedu                         dick detweiler  rdetweilhpdmd00boihpcom

   after reading my local paper today i found out that the phillies started the 0000 season at 000  i am not as old as 0000 but ive heard many talk about the serious choke job the phillies did that season they were ahead of the cardinals by 00 games that season in midaugust  they managed to lose a bunch from then on and the cardinals took the division  00 games ahead and lost it i hope this season is much different   strictly from memory i think the phillies were something like ten games up with 00 to go lost 00 in a row and 00 of last 00 to lose to the cardinals seems impossible but thats how i remember it i also felt at the time that johnny callison of the phillies lost the mvp as a byproduct of their swoon   jerry  ps in 0000 a single team out of 0 won the pennant no divisions

   landmann writes  joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball    for anyone who didnt see sundays game    with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed  hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers        thats because lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games before that     and was daytoday only available as a pinchrunner      later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts  lankford a 000 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis  alicea a 000 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  what the hell  is he thinking       see above    earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented  how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a  regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said  he liked gilkey coming off the bench  gilkey hit over 000 last year  what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every  team in the league       at the beginning of the interview torre also said lankford is the one outfield     guy whos in there no matter what     my guess is jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low     on base percentage  whiten was a great acquisition decent offense     and great defense in rightfield  but dont worry gilkey will be starting             as soon as jordan or whiten displays an extended period of low offensive     output

   some pleasant and then some not so pleasant surprises about the 0000 edition of the bronx bombers so far  first the pleasant  0spike owen  all through spring training this guy was    looking like the second coming of mike gallego but with   even worse hitting now the guy is third in the major leagues   in ba and hes ranked pretty high in total hits and runs   scored i know its still early in the season but he and    pat kelly more on him in a minute have provided a lot of    spark at the bottom of the order thats given the big guys   mattingly tartabull oneill plenty of rbi opportunities   lets hope he keeps this up  0pat kelly the guy is finally showing some of the ability   that led stick michael to label him a star for the 00s   i wouldnt go that far but kelly looks infinitely improved   at bat i guess the tips he took from boggs in spring training   really paid off huh and here i thought boggs would never   do anything to help anybody besides himself and his glove   like always has been terrific he and mattingly comprise the   best defensive right side of the infield in all of baseball imho  0paul oneill we had to get rid of roberto kelly partly    because he was under too much pressure in ny to be the next   barry bonds he wont do that in cincy either and partly   because he had this real unprofessional tendency to give up   in the second half of the year i just felt that we couldve   gotten more for him than oneill well so far oneill is   turning out just fine he looks like he should be able to   duplicate if not surpass mel halls numbers from last year   and he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around tartabull   now if only buck would play him against lefties some more to    see what he can do  0wickman a friend made a comparison between wickman and jack   morris  they never have impressive stats but they always   find some way to win although morris seems to be losing that   ability i figured that wickman would be the least important   part of the steve sax trade best trade since we got that ruth   guy maybe winding up as a good middle reliever but i like what   ive seen so far he doesnt pitch pretty but he gets the job done  0key whats going on here key was just supposed to provide   the rotation with some stability you know shore up the left   side provide experience get maybe 00 wins and here this guy   is dominating everybody he faces who needs maddux or cone 00   ill take key any day  and now the not so pleasant surprises  0spike owen sure hes hitting like crazy but the guy cannot   field to save his life and they said he was brought in to   provide defense velarde stankiewicz and even silvestri   are better defensively than owen          remember  its still early look for his offense to tail off and his defense to improve hopefully he has that rep because i heard that either last year or over the last 0 years or something like that  he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops  behind cr and tony im not gonna help this sorry mets team at all fernandez i do agree though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far  0tartabull the book on tartabull was keep him healthy and   hell produce well he hasnt done too much so far sure hes   hit a few homers but those were all solo shots and he hasnt   gotten any of the big rbis that your cleanup man is supposed   to give you then again he had a slow start last year once he   got off the dl that is and turned into a oneman wrecking crew   late in the year so well see  0the bullpen ughwhat happened we were supposed to have   one of the most solid pens in the majors meanwhile the pen   has already blown three saves maybe more  i havent checked   the great howefarr leftyrighty tandem farrs era is in the   00s or 00s and howes isinfinite i didnt think such   a thing was possible but it is hopefully theyll get their   acts together or else bucks gonna burn out the starters   for fear that the bullpenll blow a lead  in the immortal words of the scooter holy cow seaver that johnny key guy can pitch cant he  see you in the series  alan

   are you for real  how many gold gloves does ozzie smith have  if a guy hung around and hit 00 homers a year for 00 years wouldnt he be a given for the hall  is defense not just as important  frankly no  offense and defense are equally important  but the pitcher is 00 of the defense  the primary role of every other player is on offense  even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive game than of the defensive game  they might not do much with their part of the offense but thats another issue  that being said i think both smith and yount deserve the hof  they hit pretty well in addition to their defense  cheers valentine

  hello all  id like to learn how to keep score when i watch ball games using official scoring methods where can i get scoresheets and instructions on how to use them  i appreciate it  mike    hofstadters law  it always takes  michael wilson              longer than you think even if you idoycrux0citcornelledu  take into account hofstadters law                 douglas hofstadter   
   i made a mistake on the posted article been fighting food poisoning for last 00 hours  the second paragraph should state the following  doctors cleared sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball on a tee and to catch a ball in his gloved hand  sorry for the error didnt know it until after posting  jeffery

  disclaimer  this is for fun  in my computerized baseball game i keep track of a category called stolen hits defined as a play made that an average fielder would not make with average effort  using the 0000 defensive averages posted by sherri nichols thanks sherri ive figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen hits stolen have been redefined as plays kurt stillwell would not have made  ok i realize thats unfair  kurts probably the victim of pitching staff fluke shots and a monster park factor  but lets put it this way  if we replaced every second baseman in the nl with someone with kurts 000 out making ability how many extra hits would go by  to try and correlate it to reality a little more ive calculated net hits stolen based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make  by the same method ive calculated net double plays and net extra bases doubles and triples let by  finally i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution or dcon   basically it represents the defensive contribution of a player i add this number to ops to get dops defense  onbase plus slug which should represent the players total contribution to the team  so dont take it too seriously  the formula for dcon appears at the end of this article  the short version  definition of terms hs  hits stolen  extra outs compared to kurt stillwell nhs  net hits stolen  extra outs compared to average fielder ndp  net double plays  extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder neb  net extra bases   extra bases prevented compared to avg fielder dcon  defensive contribution  bases and hits prevented as a rate dops  dcon  ops  quick  dirty measure of players total contribution  national league  name            hs   nhs   ndp   neb   dcon    dops alicea l      00    00    0    0    000    000 sandberg r   000    00    0     0    000   0000 thompson r    00    00    0    0    000    000 lind j        00     0   0     0    000    000 doran b       00    0    0     0    000    000 deshields d   00     0   0     0   000    000 harris l      00    0    0     0   000    000 lemke m       00    0   0    0   000    000 morandini m   00    0   0     0   000    000 randolph w    00   00    0    0   000    000 biggio c      00   00   0     0   000    000 stillwell k    0   00   0    0   000    000  ordered by dops  0000 sandberg  000 alicea  000 thompson  000 deshields  000 doran  000 nl average  000 biggio  000 harris  000 randolph  000 morandini  000 lemke  000 lind  000 stillwell  american league   name            hs   nhs   ndp   neb   dcon    dops fletcher s    00    00    0     0    000    000 reed j        00    00    0     0    000    000 ripken b      00     0   0    0    000    000 baerga c      00     0   00     0    000    000 blankenship l 00     0    0     0    000    000 miller k      00    0    0    0   000    000 alomar r      00     0   0    0   000    000 knoblauch c   00   00    0    0   000    000 bordick m     00    0   0    0   000    000 kelly p       00    0   0    0   000    000 whitaker l    00    0   0    0   000    000 reynolds h    00    0   0     0   000    000 sax s         00    0   0    0   000    000 sojo l        00   00   0     0   000    000  order by dops  000 baerga 000 alomar 000 fletcher 000 whitaker 000 blankenship 000 miller 000 knoblauch 000 reed 000 bordick 000 al average 000 kelly 000 ripken 000 reynolds 000 sojo 000 sax  more discussion   dcon formula  nhs  ndppa  nhs  ndp  nebab why such a bizzare formula  basically its designed to be added into the ops with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored the extra outs are factored into obp while the extra bases removed are  factored into slg  thats why i used pa and ab as the divisors  for more discussion see the post on hits stolen  first base 0000   dale j stephenson  stephcsuiucedu  baseball fanatic    it is considered good to look wise especially when not     overburdened with information  j golden kimball

  as of today april 00 jack morris has lost his first three starts  however the jays are doing well without him and injured dave stuart  this is a credit to the rest of the pitching staff  has jack lost a bit of his edge what is the worst start jack morris has had    
    davis and strawberry attributed their turn arounds to reggie smith the dodger batting coach who flew in from florida three days ago and gave them a pep talk and some instruction  davis was 00 yesterday and had a couple more hits today  strawberry had two hits yesterday and i believe he had two more today with two home runs   foolish me  and here i thought it had something to do with the  fact that they were hitting against wakefield who had no kncukle to his ball that day and otto who has no stuff  i wonder if  reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the lineup who also suddenly came alive those two games    the beastmaster     mark singer     mssnetcomcom

  kingozcamelotbradleyedu orin roth writes     well officially its the braves at least up until they started winning    it was are they still officially     if so why and how did they receive this label        unoffically but without a doubt americas team is the cubs why    well my guess is because america loves underdogs every year no matter    the cubs talent or the predictions they never as close to never as    possible win anything over the years as the losing has mounted america    has fallen in love with these perennial losers the cubs have more fans    in chicago then some teams do worldwide the cubs have more fans     worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined     an aura of excitement surrounds the cubs at the beginning of the season    like no one else including the ws champs it must be that eternal hope    this is the year theyve got the talent theyre off to a good start     theyve got the pitching or hitting or whatever their strong point is     at the time its that inevitability that the cubs will eventually      win the ws again when only god knows since its been so long it     could come at any time or it could be another 00 years but until they    do finally win and start winning consistently the cubs will remain    americas lovable underdogs the cubs areamericas team    orin    bradley u  the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes out of nowhere to contend  the 00 mets and 00 orioles are prime examples not the cubs  i root for the cubs because i feel sorry for them but  basically they are dogs  the pirates today are a great example of an underdog if the rockies and marlins compete they will be underdogs  the north stars trip to the stanley cup finals was a good example of an underdogs journey  the cubs have a good team this year and play in a weak division they are much less than americas team      im really a jester in disguise                                      chintan amin the university of illinois urbanachampaign mail llamauiucedu neil peart c0000 quick to judge quick to anger slow to understand ignorance and prejudice andfearwalkhandinhand

   in a previous article swedacssitdumichedu sean sweda says   ive been saying this for quite some time but being absent from the net for a while i figured id stick my neck out a bit  the royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an al team since the inception of the dh rule  ps any ideas what this is  they will fall easily short of 000 runs thats for damn sure  i cant believe these media fools picking them to win the division like our tom gage of the detroit news claiming herk robinson is some kind of genius for the tradesaquisitions hes made       would you say the same thing about the dodgers in 00 or 00  true cone is probably as good as drysdale and they have no koufax but still these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals with lots of lowscoring games etc  and they didnt use relievers whereas jeff montgomery is having a super season for them      that being said i still picked them 0th or so but i think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting  theres more of a chance of that i think than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching  at least to me      i wonder though  which one do you people think would do better  a team with johnson koufax in his prime seaver carlton and young in no real order as the starters with sutter fingers and lyle in the bullpen but with a puny offense assuming good defense like mazeroski maranville etc or a team with poor pitching but with an offense of cobb carew ruth gehrig mays schmidt wagner and bench  againyou pick the order      i would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons end  even the best hitters can succeed only 00 of the time in their best years but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts  taking all the players in their prime they might throw 00 shutouts in a year  and all the offense would have to do is get 0 run across      i wonder if someone with stratomatic or something could plug such all time teams into a regular season have it played and report the results i would love to see that   doug fowler dxf00pocwruedu   me age 0  now mommys and daddys  other     ever wonder if after casey  relatives have to give lots of hugs  love missed the 0rd strike in the poem  support cause heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it      big hug that lasts forever and ever

  to all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three homer games ina career the answer is johnny mize in his career with the  cards and the yanks  he hit three 0 times  i am almost sure about this in case anyone is wondering the record for two homer games is held by babe ruth and is 00  mizes record may not last for much longer because of juan gonzalez  he has at least three games with three and maybe 0  i know that  he had at least two last year and one as a rookie  i dont have any record books at college for me to check on though  please let me know okay if i  am wrong   onto the padres  is there anyone out there who follows them especially those with access to local news  i dont here anything in los angeles and i cant get mcpaper consistently around here   comment  it looks as though san diego has gotten the better of the two deals that brought bell and plantier to the padres  it has also forced the team to use darrell shermann  of course plantier could get injured again or he could  hit with the power of 00 but with a lower average  bell always could finish with 000 and 0000 hrsessentially jerald clarks numbers   leadoff comment  craig shipley  i get on base 00 of the time if im  lucky at leadoff  hell of the usual starters use gwynn  hes got 0 steals already  is shipley starting because of an injury to stillwell though  i havent seen stillwells name in any box scores  anyway unless you are going to use shermann at leadoff then use gwynn  he at lesat gets on base and this year is stealing bases sheffield comment  though the season is early and stats mean nothing witness phillips batting 000 currently  but does sheffield have an injury or anythingelse wrong with him  i just dont hear anything andy benes  is he pitching like he did in the second half of 00   or is  this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then   has anyone  seen him pitch the two good games score for today sunday april 00  padres 00 st louis 0  padres sweep the cardinals as gwynn goes 0 for 0 with a homer  sheffield and tueful also homer in a winning cause   thanks for listeningreading any comments  kelly keach kkeachpomonaclaremontedu

   so far simmons looks like a total idiot   0 zane smith should learn how to switchpitch and return from the dl i would rather have zane smith pitch right handed than have moeller pitch at all  0 i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an impressive win last week now ottos latest debacle has restored simmons reputation now he looks like he is back in his 00 form when he had the als highest era among starters four our sakenot teds sake i hope he pitches with a 00 era for the rest of the season yeah right  0 tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing they are still doing decently but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters merced had a very good oba his rookie year he showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year  0 walk well he seems to be on the losing end tonight but i still think that walk desrved his contract  0 leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation i cant understand his and managements fear of losing tom prince through waivers even if they do whats the use he is aright hander like slaught not a very smart platoon also i am blaming leyland in this case since he is hcurrently    convinced that lavalliere is through while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffsslaught should have played in all 0 games he has a good average against right handed pitching didnt leyland and simmons forsee this last year and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself any fool could tell them lavalliere wasnt very fit last year  0 dennis moeller is scary 0 candeleria well he is not going to have such a high era at the end of the season maybe it will be in 00 range but 0 million  plus come on other than the customary home run giving stage patterson goes through for a few weeks patterson has served the pirates very well each year so far he seems to have pitched well for the rangers i think the pirates should have spent the money on patterson in stead  0 the rookie batters well young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact other than that their excellent performance hasnt been too much of a surprise i think we should thank doughty for that  0 rookie pitchers worse than expected especially cooke 00 slaught how come he wasnt given a contract extension last year now his value has increased immensely  00 lonnie smith well eric davis was signed for a comparable amount lets see eric can hit better he can run better he can field better now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis an injured davis is better than a healthy lonnie smith even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this yearhe wont be an asset he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field  00 management big big zero sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing he seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay 00 alex cole fiasco the pirates infield and cf positions look good the rf and lf would have looked good if we could have gotten cole to replace two of the four outfielders eric davis van slyke and cole would have made a very respectable outfield even without eric davis thye pirates would have a respectable outfield with cole svan slyke and mercedi think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting simmons did have options for the outfield ironically the biggest accomplishment of simmons tenure was getting alex cole really cheap too bad  00 compensatory draft picks for bonds forget it the pirates can rant and rave they will not get those picks as of now the issue is still being appealed now if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots nothing else will  on a final note tim wakefield wont be as awful as he was in his last 0 starts but dont count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season also if the pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season they will miss reduss clutch hitting and his speedhe has peaked in the second half of the last 0 seasons   pravin ratnam

   there are two conflicting reports about a pitcher that is either in the jays farm system or the braves his name is bill taylor he was picked up by the jays but had to be offered back to the braves before they were able to send him to the syracuse chiefs  one report says that the braves took him back and assigned him to richmond the other says that he is on the chiefs roster which one is right

   so far simmons looks like a total idiot  0 leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation i cant understand his and managements fear of losing tom prince through waivers even if they do whats the use he is aright hander like slaught not a very smart platoon also i am blaming leyland in this case since he is hcurrently    convinced that lavalliere is through while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffsslaught should have played in all 0 games he has a good average against right handed pitching didnt leyland and simmons forsee this last year and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself any fool could tell them lavalliere wasnt very fit last year  sorry but this is the biggest load of bunk ive seen in a while  a the pirates have been trying to trade lavalliere for some time now nobody was even vaguely interested b several other teams had made it known that they would grab prince who was out of options c lavallieres release had nothing to do with him being through he was released because in the event of an injury to slaught lavalliere is no longer capable they believe of being the everyday catcher  since slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties the offense should actually improve with this move  toby

  michael chen mikecunixfcccolumbiaedu wrote   in any case i think viola would have made a better signing  why  viola is younger and is left handed how many left handed starters does  toronto have  well i agree that viola is a better signing  however why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters  i understand lefthanded spot relievers even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters  i just dont understand why people insist on lefthanded starters unless there is a park effect eg yankee stadium most batters in mlb are righthanded so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters i guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to lhps than rhps  however this is probably only a factor in the postseason because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season  i think you just want the best starters you can get regardless of whether they are lefties or righties  lefthanded starters tend to have higher eras than righthanded starters precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties or perhaps because of the platoon advantage  am i missing something here  craig  
   hey valentine i dont see boston with any world series rings on their fingers  yah  so  damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his  future  he certainly didnt earn his last one  how many games did he blow in the world series  all of the ones he started  therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing  oh yes  definitely  therefore morris is better than clemens  dont give me that shit  if boston had alomar olerud henke and ward while toronto had rivera jack clark jeff reardon things would have looked a little different last fall  give credit where credit is due  this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick  and dont tell me boston will win this year  they wont  even be in the top 0 in the division more like 0th  im willing to bet they dont finish sixth  im also willing to bet they dont finish first  and if you give me 00 odds im willing to bet that they finish ahead of the blue jays  valentine  
   the only really valid retort to valentine is werent the red sox trying to get morris too oh sure they said viola was their first choice afterwards but what should we have expected they would say  lou wanted morris all along  the idiot  giving the man 00 million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded uzi with the safety off  the only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away   and dont tell me boston will win this year  they wont   even be in the top 0 in the division more like 0th  if this is true it wont be for lack of contribution by viola so who cares  i dont see why people expect boston to finish sixth  the bottom four teams last year were essentially tied  boston in seventh place had 00 wins  the yankees and indians tied for fourth place had 00 wins  now i should think it is obvious that the red sox improved more than the indians or tigers  basically the red sox are stronger this year at 0b dh ss lf and rf  they have healthier starting pitchers so far at least and better relievers  i see no reason why they shouldnt win 00 games  meanwhile the indians are in shambles and the tigers still have no pitching  they will win some 000 blowouts but they will lose an awful lot of 00 games too  maybe the sox will play poorly win 00 games and finish fifth but i think third or fourth place is more likely  cheers valentine

  the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their quest for more lefthanded pitching  so far no takers personally i think harris is a defensive liability and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays or at least been among the leaders   sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day he can get the job done  if sharpy played just one base every day say third hed also improve defensively   wallach has helped tremendously on defense as has reed the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff  both astacio and martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years   astacio lasted 0 innings the other day under similar circumstances the dodgers are turning double plays and keeping more balls in the infield than last year  and piazza has also been great on defense  he has thrown out 00 of 00 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first   wallach clearly has contributed to the over all improvement on defense  but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers some runs  but i dont think he is as bad as his current average i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw seem to have come out of theirs   dodger

  or second starter  it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs  the team that scores the most  runs wins  this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs  a low  scoring game would clearly benefit the braves   not clear to me at all  id certainly rather have a team who was winning 00 games than 00 games  in the 00 game luck is going to play a much bigger role than in the 00 game   sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

  reed0000iscsvaxuniedu writes         dave winfields name does not go  in the same sentence as aaron robinson and ott            in terms of peak and i repeat peak years winfield has done it   all he has batted in the 000s for a season drove in 000 and more runs   many times in a row before his injury consistently hit at or near 000   while knocking in 00 home runs have you even looked at dave winfields   slugging percentage for three or 0 of his best seasons i still think that   dave was one of the better of all time but obviously not the best he was   one of the best athletes evr to play baseball he hit line drives that hit   the scoreboard in leftcenter field a feat np one has done in the new   stadium heck only 0 or 0 other people have hit it over that green fence   since it has been remodeled he could field had a bullet arm and his   hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields and barry bonds   of last season he is older now and slowing down takes more of an   uppercut to lift the ball out of the park but he will always be my hero   and my idol there is nothing that could make me happier than george   inviting dave back to the bronx to play his last year of ball with the   yankees of course he will most likely refuse the offer but who knows   for 0 million dollars hell play heck they are giving gallego 00   million this year having dave as their dh while leaving him time to play   the field when tartabull is injured or nokes and mass are traded should   give the yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age   of yankee domination   michael lurie  
  sepinwall writes    some pleasant and then some not so pleasant surprises about the 0000  edition of the bronx bombers so far    0wickman a friend made a comparison between wickman and jack    morris  they never have impressive stats but they always    find some way to win although morris seems to be losing that    ability i figured that wickman would be the least important    part of the steve sax trade best trade since we got that ruth    guy maybe winding up as a good middle reliever but i like   what    ive seen so far he doesnt pitch pretty but he gets the job   done           actually i kind of liked the abott trade we did trade the rookie of   the year snow but with don mattingly at first for another 0 years why   bother  
  sepinwall writes  farrs era is in the    00s or 00s and howes isinfinite i didnt think such    a thing was possible but it is    actually according to usa today howe has 0 inning atttributed to him   but maybe that is incorrect by the excellent report  
   ill tell youm all one thing steve howe and farr are much better then the   worst pitcher in yankee pitching    who do you think i am talking about ill post the answers if you email   to me use reply or post youre answers but emailing them to me meaqns   that i will post the final results i have one particular horrid pitcher   in mind  
  sepinwall writes    thanks alan that was well thought out  even written in an entertaining style  
       hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves it i mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon  oh yeah  dave winfieldmarginal player  guy didnt hit a lick had negligible power was a crap fielder and had no staying power  dave winfield now entering his i believe 00th big league season is still a damn decent hitter  admittedly his defense has slipped a great deal but in his prime he had a powerful arm and great range  take a look at the stats  i dont  know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman are similar players  kingman was a onedimension power hitterhe couldnt field he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if i remember right his obp wasnt that hideous and for those who consider such things important was a absoluteprimodick   eddie murray  yup only the best 0st baseman of the 00s  i know that mvp votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of the mvp he deserved in 0000 it seems that he wasnt overrated by the media   lee smith  hmmmm this ones actually pretty close  hes had a s solid dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  wrigley fenway  id have to take a closer look at the stats its been  a while but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber   you do make a legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers simply racking up a lot of saves doesnt mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch too  simply because minnesota and boston and for a month atlanta used reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one  the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves  no way should  homerman be in the hof imho darrell evans  nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like ted simmons imho but not a hofer       well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards marginal  lemme ask you this  who the hell playing the game isnt marginal  honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there theyre both shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal lets be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something  now wait a goddamn minute here  ozzie smith absolutely redefined the position of shortstop  his defense was so good that hes won something along the lines of 00 gold gloves  again gold gloves are mediotbiased and a  good argument could be made that larkin deserved one or two of ozzies more recent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early 00s getting the gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier in his career  ozzies offense you ask  good obp great speed numbers in a park which for most of his career depressed offense admittedly no power cept against tom niedenfuer  but still a definite asset offensively yount  0000 hits mvp at two different positions uhhuh a real stiff  his 00 was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks as far as ss numbers go  hes a clear hofer imho  isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when  certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential  candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan  well as far as garvey goes youre right  garvey is a mediot  candidate pushed because of his winning attitude a minor factor if one at all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range of a tree stump  garvey shouldnt be in the hof skyjack  ive said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last year or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about morris ability to win which is nothing more than morris ability to pitch when toronto to score tons of runs  at this point morris is an average pitcher although from his early returns in 00 he may be damned  close to done  but in all fairness morris was a dominant pitcher in the 00s for upanddown tiger teams  while 0000 was obviously a great year for detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention but not favorites  morris career numbers are quite good and worthy of hof consideration   ryan  of course but be careful  i guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about yount and smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time  after all nolan never won a cy  damn hes  just pitcher who hung around for 00 years  his wl record is mediocre of course nolans a hofer puck  probably although hes got to play reasonably well for a few more years 00 years even good ones arent enough to make the hof most likely  that said i believe puckett will make the hof pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something really  tragic or sudden  hes very popular in the media and with fans and legitimately has been one of the best cfs in the game since he joined the league  ive always liked the guy and i hope he does make it  and in the end i think the puck will make it in  but really its too early to sell  this debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it  or not i never tire of it  its an interesting subject  heres an off the top of my head list of potential hofers from each team  i probably left a couple of guys off so feel free to follow up  i wont consider anyone who started playing after about 0000 again too early to tell note these are all active players im not counting recent retirees  baltimore  cal ripken should be a lock by now even if gehrigs record stands boston roger clemens might be a lock already which is amazing dawson  detroit alan trammell and lou whitaker possibilities milwaukee robin yount discussed earlier new york wade boggs possibly mattingly long shot toronto paul molitor and jack morris possibilities  kansas city george brett lock minnesota kirby too early to tell winfield lock oakland eckersley lock mcgwire too early rickey lock welch long shot texas the mighty nolan too early to consider canseco or strange   cubs sandberg lock st louis ozzie lock lee smith probably new york murray almost a lock saberhagen obviously hes got to regain         past form and most certainly not vince coleman despite what hell tell you   los angeles butler strawberry and hershiser are all long shots san diego tony gwynn pretty good shot colorado dale murphy a good shot ryan bowen just to see if youre awake  before i get flames this is an offthetopofthehead list theres probably a few deserving candidates that i left off and i didnt include barry bonds will clark any atlanta starting pitcher frank thomas canseco mcgriff etc because i only considered guys who started playing before 0000  email or post i almost fear what i may have started here   bruce hasch                haschjhuvmshcfjhuedu        sell the team eli if a hitter is a good fastball hitter does that mean i should throw him a  bad fastball larry andersen  
  darryl strawberrys moon shots were fun  he can hit those high and far home runs that if he actually ran them out hed be rounding second base by the time they landed  we used to say that he should have to file a flight plan at laguardia for some of them  then bulldurham came out and that was changed    on homers he pulled that didnt go high they were microwave home runs microwave as in they got outta there in a hurry  in a game in 0000 he came off the bench with the flu and on the second pitch send a rocket down the right field line that didnt even allow bob murphy the luxury of a home run call  the story went he stayed in the clubhouse the with the mets down by two and two on davey johnson sent for him to pinch hit he came out of the clubhouse saying one swing and we go home  he hit the homer ran the bases then went straight for the clubhouse to shower and go home  those were the days   scott barman     mets mailing list feed the following into your shell scottasdcom               mail metsrequestasdcom                              subscribe  lets go mets               
  my question to you all is why does the media seem to embrace the theme of the death of baseball so strongly  i have seen articles of a similar vein in  the chicago tribune and in sports editorials on tv  maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom  these allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times losing money bankruptcies at an alarming rate and theres going to be an increased degradation of the product they produce  could you imagine ibm with all their problems promoting themselves the way major league baseball does  their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths not that they are too far from it now   what would happen at gm  where would gm be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an inferior product because of alleged labor problems i think it shows a lack of confidence for the people who run the game  anyway it just frustrates me when the media says such things because it inevitably leads to owners trying quick fixes like increasing playoffs to satisfy television or trying interleague play to drum up interest    forget it  word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about a done deal  it has to be decided soon since negotiations with the networks also have to begin soon   scott barman     mets mailing list feed the following into your shell scottasdcom               mail metsrequestasdcom                              subscribe  lets go mets

  boy hats off to any cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put down braves fans  i mean all the braves have done is gone to two consecutive world series  also being the cubs fan that i am i really have to hand it to all the braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that infernal cheer that they have    however i do have to protest anyone saying that all cubs fans are stupid  the way i see it either im just too stupid to acknowledge it or that observation was just plain wrong  you might have us confused with bear fans   anyway about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the cubs would finish up last in their division  even behind florida  sheesh   these same people were predicting the braves to clean up in their respective division  well  were ten games into the season and these people are a little less vocal now  i wonder why  well the way i see it the east is up for grabs and whoever wants it most is going to take it with the exception of florida  every team seems to have good batting and pitching with philly presently leading the pack  but i just have to point out if the cubs do take the east theyll do it without the benefit of a competent manager  however and it pains me to say it the pennant is going to go to the west  just had to get that off my chest  doc  bem benefit of a compee  
  was going over some videos last night  studying 0000 and 0000 videotapes of jose canseco proved to be very interesting  and enlightening  heres my analysis of jose canseco circa sep 00 and jose canseco circa june 0000  0  hes bulked up too much  period  he needs to lose about 00 pounds     not gain more bulk  0  his bat speed has absolutely vanished  conservatively id say hes     lost 00 of his bat speed and thats a huge amount of speed  0  that open stance is killing him   note that he acts sort of like     brian downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is     released  downing could do this without significant head movement      canseco cant  also note that canseco doesnt always close his     stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes     theyre fully closed  without a good starting point its hard     to make adjustments in your swing  what would i do if i were jose  aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch so that id never have to work again id restructure my entire swing  first minimize movement before the swing  close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing  hopefully this will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely  second drop 00 pounds  cut out the weight work  third relax the wrists  will cost some power but until i can find my 0000 stroke concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up rolling the wrists through the strike zone and hit line drives  his strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park  if cansecos open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems hell be out of baseball in three years  if not he could still hit 000 hr        gary huckabay    you think thats loud enough ahole               movie rights    well if youre having trouble hearing it sir       available thru    id be happy to turn it up for you  i didnt           ted frank     know that many people your age liked kings x     
  for the second straight game california scored a ton of late runs to crush the brewhas it was six runs in the 0th for a 000 win monday and five in the 0th and six in the 0th for a 000 win yesterday jamie navarro pitched seven strong innings but orosco austin manzanillo and lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday hows this for numbers maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and navarros era is 000 the next lowest on the staff is wegman at 000 ouch  it doesnt look much better for the hitters hamilton is batting 000 while thon is hitting 000 and has seven rbi the next highest is three the next best hitter is jaha at 000 and then vaughn who has the teams only hr at 000 another ouch looking at the stats its not hard to see why the team is 00 in fact 00 doesnt sound bad when youre averaging three runsgame and giving up 00game   still its early and things will undoubtedly get better the offense should come around but the bullpen is a major worry fetters plesac and austin gave the brewers great middle relief last year lloyd maldanado manzanillo  fetters austin and orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place the starters will be okay the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around but the bullpen is a big question mark  in other news nilsson and doran were reactivated yesterday while william suero was sent down and tim mcintosh was picked up by montreal todays game with california was cancelled  salty

  heres my analysis of jose canseco circa sep 00 and jose canseco circa june 0000  0  hes bulked up too much  period  he needs to lose about 00 pounds     not gain more bulk  ive been saying that for at least 0 years now and even the as conditioning guru told jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his backalthough i dont for one second believe jose used steroidshis back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their framesee jeff bregel ex 00er as a textbook example and imho jose is too big for his frame   0  his bat speed has absolutely vanished  conservatively id say hes     lost 00 of his bat speed and thats a huge amount of speed  i cant imagine how to estimate bat speed but its pretty obvious that jose is missing fastballs he used to hit likely due to his back   0  that open stance is killing him   note that he acts sort of like     brian downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is     released  downing could do this without significant head movement      canseco cant  also note that canseco doesnt always close his     stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes     theyre fully closed  without a good starting point its hard     to make adjustments in your swing  i dont know he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the as and had no problems with it then it might be that preback problems he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused but now hes lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him the old saying if youre hot its a trigger mechanism if youre cold its a hitch   first minimize movement before the swing  close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing  hopefully this will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely  the biggest problem imho is he never has found a stance hes comfortable with for more than a few months he changes his stance so much he loses track of where the strike zone is in wednesdays night game he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me i think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because hes changed his stance so much  im also a bit concerned that because hes got palmer and gonzalez hitting all the homeruns hell become competitive swing even harder and screw himself up even worse larussa always said that cansecos famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits     russ smith  i dont know anything about xs but i know about some o                                 george gervin on being an assistant coach       
  robert c hite phillybachudeledu wrote  i think most of the problems mainly arose from manager gene mauchs  ineptitude in managing the pitching staff  down the stretch he  abused jim bunning chris short and robin roberts i think those  are the three pitching each on only 0 days rest for quite some  time  by the time they hit the last 0 weeks of the season  obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm  oh  well  roberts was long gone  he was probably an oriole in 0000  or maybe a colt 00  the 0rd starter was art mahaffey the previous years ace dennis bennett was the 0th starter  they were indeed 00 up with 00 to go but they won their final two games after the horrid 00loss streak  the final game victory bunnings 00th win if memory serves kept the reds from tying for the title they and the phils were both 0 game behind the cards with the giants another game back  the mets couldnt hold an early lead against the cards that final sunday or there would have been a 0way tie  too bad they couldnt have saved some of the 00 or so runs they scored on saturday when they crushed st louis   nealtravenpittedu      youre only young once but you can be travenvmscispittedu       immature forever    larry andersen

  substituting irony for brains bruce klopfenstein said  dtatepittedu david m tate writes   of course they left rbis off were comparing alomar the individual with  baerga the individual so only individual stats count    i forgot  most runs are scored by players stealing home so rbi dont count for anything  uh right  you also forgot that you cant get an rbi barring a hr with nobody on base  what fraction of all runs come on solo hr  most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the batter did something good  i use the phrase happened to be advisedly lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the most ability to turn it up a notch in clutchrbiwhatever situations and what theyve found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an ability to any measurable extent  there are no clutch hitters  people who tend to do things that would cause an rbi if there were somebody on base end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by being in position    my mistake  i agree  me too rbi are a worthless stat of course so is stolen bases because  sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run and of course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases so batting average slugging and obp out too  hmmm i guess homers would not count then either my point rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is and no stat or lack of can tell me there are no clutch hitters maybe no stat can tell me either but some people are i just know it 0  ed o     
   attn those who live inthe philadelphia metro area  back in september i was listening to wip and i remember the morning guys were talking with mayor ed rendell  the topic of conversation was a new ball park for the phillies  the location for this new park was suggested to be near 00th st station  at the time the mayor was optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality  has there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream i know the city of philadelphia has other projects ahead such as the new convention center and the upcoming spectrum ii  but it would be nice to see this a reality  it is planned that the phillies leave the vet and leave it solely to the eagles and if thats the case the eagles should make the vet a grass stadium but thats another story  i want to see that day  comments  
          hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves it  i     mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it  as    is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance or darrell    evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in  eddie    murray and jeff reardon  i am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and i can not without having stats to back up my points however i think you approached this the wrong way i believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman does i feel they were all much better players i am not saying i fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more   imho  dave kingman  definately not they guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag the rest of his career i do not think he was very feared by pitchers i also do not think he did a lot for the game i mean really i am a met fan  he was a met for part of his career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame  dave winfield  i think so he is feared by pitchers he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are in my opinion  without stats better than kingmans probably by quite a bit i also perceive him to be a leader maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader i think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done i know some of this from when he was with the yankees i think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the hall of fame i think it deserves some consideration  lee smith  maybe i would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of kingman  darrell evans  no  eddie murray  maybe he has had a very good career he is a leader although a silent one he is a good role model are the stats good enough i am not sure  but i would once again believe they are much better than kingmans both the average as well as the power numbers but not as good as winfields just think eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years  jeff reardon  my guess is no but it kind of depends on his numbers off the top of my head i would take lee smith first          well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody  giving    hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards  marginal    honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there theyre both    shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal    well i strongly disagree here both of these guys deserve it for sure i talked about leadership above both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers offensively the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop  he would have shattered aarons home run mark by now how many of those great plays saved games how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game while i believe both of these guys have numbers baseball is about more than numbers or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame as does george brett who also belongs in this class of player        lets be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors  so    liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if  something    isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when    certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential    candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to    the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan    steve garvey  i am not sure probably not but i guess i could see someone making a case for him   jack morris  once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up his name  kirby puckett  probably the only reason i do not say definately is he still has time left in his career if he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately  nolan ryan  is there really any doubt i think i heard something about him having some 00 records maybe they were not all good  i dont know i did not hear any of them just the number he has the numbers he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model i would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top 00 but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of his accomplishments nohitters strikeouts respectable numbers  even with some weaker teams you can go on and on i really hope he gets all the possible votes  so in summing up i have 0 groups those that belong those that probably do but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying dont belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go  yes   winfield yount brettnot in your mail o smith puckett and ryan maybe  murray and l smith no  reardon garvey morris evans and definately kingman  as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this up  these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions  mike

  second basemen in history he probably didnt even have as good a season as alomar last year  guess which line is which baobpslgabh0b0bhrbb x000000000000000000000 y0000000000000000000000  the walks should give it away  obps in general somewhat more valuable than slugging and alomars edge in obp was quite a bit larger than baergas edge in slugging  im no sdcn but whats more valuable  00 hits w0 more doubles 00 more hrs   or 0 more triples and 00 bbs  lets not forget the 00 extra sbs how many cs  of course the 00 hits and 00 homers are more valuable  but dont forget the 00 outs  you cant have it both ways baergas higher raw numbers are due to him having more playing time and thus he had more hits and homers but dont forget the cost of those outs  btw just to answer your question alomar had 00 sb and 0 cs baerga had 00 sb and 0 cs which gives a minute plus on alomars side  something else to consider  alomars hr splits were 000000 slg 000000 obp baergas was 000000 and 000000 pretty clearly alomar got a huge boost from his home park  id say you could make a good for them being about equal right now tp rated baerga higher actually  mike   disclaimer  these opiinihh damn hh q   w  q  wq  wq d  x  exit x q  c  quitbye  ctrlaltdel   q  q  logout  savequit quit zz zzzzzz vi  man vi   l  c   e x i t  help  helpquit d  d  man help c c e help exit quit q ctrlshftdel hey what does stop l0a d

      alomar fans left rbi fans and runs off this list because they are dependant  on the team to a large extent if frank thomas hit first hed lose a lot  of rbis and anyways how many 0nd place hitters have you known to drive  in 000 runs doesnt happen that oftenvery unlikely with devon whites  000 obp in front of you im pretty sure that sandberg has done this at least once  i know someone will correct me if im wrong    rbis and runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics  you can talk about obp and slg all you want but the fact remains  the team that scores more runs wins the game   flame away   john bratt       gord niguma  fav player john olerud    
   joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball    for anyone who didnt see sundays game    with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed  hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers    later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts  lankford a 000 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis  alicea a 000 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  what the hell  is he thinking  educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year lankford injured himself in a previous game and torre was resting him  as far as the whittengilkey controversy  whitten adds some more needed power and if jordan continues to hit the way he has been gilkey will find himself in the starting lineup soon enough  sam    brian landmann                                              georgia institute of technology                             internetgt0000aprismgatechedu

        actually i kind of liked the abott trade we did trade the rookie of   the year snow but with don mattingly at first for another 0 years why   bother  id be willing to make two wagers 0 snow doesnt win roy 0 mattingly is out of baseball within five years  im skeptical of the first because i dont think snow is that good a player and he is on a losing team  im skeptical of the second because of his back  mattingly is 00 this year and how many players play until they are 00  not too many and most of them didnt have chronic back problems when they were 00  could be wrong on either or both but i think thats the smart way to bet  cheers valentine

   my point rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is and no stat or lack of can tell me there are no clutch hitters maybe no stat can tell me either but some people are i just know it 0  i was hoping somebody would mention clutch  clutch  baerga  the two words simply do not go together  with runners in scoring position baerga batted 000000000 last year  this doesnt quite suck but most batters hit better in this situation  alomar  he hit 000000000 with runners in scoring position  the difference  alomar had 00 rbis in 000 such ab  baerga had 00 rbis in 000 such ab  baerga got 00 more chances yet succeeded only 00 more times  frankly i dont believe in clutch  but if i did my vote would go to alomar for mvp let alone best 0b in the al  valentine  
  steve tomassi writes        hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves it i mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon  unfortunately you seem to lack the ability to rate players  dave winfield has had a better career than half the people in the hall of fame  eddie murray and darrel evans are both one of the top 000 players of all time  lee smith has had probably the greatest long career of any relief pitcher since 0000 with the possible exception of gossage  on the other hand kingman probably isnt one of the best 000 players of all time  and reardon though a good pitcher isnt in smiths class career wise       well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards marginal  honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there theyre both shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal  were talking 0 of the top 00 players of all time here  there probably arent 0 shortstops in history who were better than these two       lets be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent  garvey sucked  morris while a very good pitcher simply doesnt belong near cooperstown   gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan  if puckett and ryan okay no if there get into to the hall they will be  marginal hall of famers unless puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for a while longer  to put this in perspective heres a listing of the linear weights values of the careers of the players you mention  in parenthesis is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it while no one would claim these are perfect rankings they should give you a good value of these guys careers as compared to average players  robin yount 000 00 ozzie smith 000 00 dave winfield 000 00 eddie murray 000 00 darrel evans 000 00 kirby puckett 000 000 nolan ryan 000 000 jack morris 000 000 dave kingman 00  steve garvey 00  to give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the hall of the 00 eligible players whose career stats equaled 000 00 are in the hall of fame the ones who arent include 0 00th century players ron santo bobby grich and bob johnson  of those eligible who score between 000 and 000 00 of 00 are in  of those eligible who score between 000 and 000 00 of 00 are in    greg   
  in a philadelphia inquirer a few days ago it was reported that there were two 0 plans for a new phillies stadium  the alreadymentioned 00th street station proposal and a location near broad street and race street i think  i cant remember the exact details but the stadium would be build practically downtown  there is a small lot that could be used according to the paper  the 00th street plan has run into some trouble because amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to accomodate the stadium  i dont have an opinion just yet just letting everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon however because nobody wants to pay for it        keith kellerlets go rangers lets go quakers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs              when i want your opinion ill give it to you   
  can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make absolutely no sense  at least in the local gannett rag that finds its way to my door  i must have stared at cleman in the mets box for a good 00 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was  wouldnt it make more sense to use colemn  jay  
  one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasnt yet been addressed  i believe the rule also does not deal with this situation  if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught runners can tag up and advance at their own risk as on any fly ball  however if the infield fly is not caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base wo fear of being doubled off for advancing too early  when the ball hits the ground  when a fielder first touches the ball after it hits the ground  enlightenment would be appreciated  jay     
   baseball players past and present  we werent able to come up  with much except for sandy koufax somebody stankowitz and  maybe john lowenstein  can anyone come up with any more  i know  it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but  humor us  thanks for your help     john lowenstein is definately not jewish  many in baltimore thought he was especially after he told the baltimore jewish times sobut later he admitted that it was a joke

  yeah the phillies played over their heads almost the whole year but it all caught up to them in one 00game streak i am as old as 0000 man and i was a big phillies fan at the time age 00    the dodgers or somebody else finish two games back that has to be one of the closest last minute scrambles ever  since i was born in the late pleistocene i too remember 0000  that year the dodgers were several games out of first and i think finished sixth in the league  this was kind of odd because they won the world series both the previous year and the following year       warren usui  im one with the universe  on a scale from 0 to 00   
  previously i wrote  yeah the phillies played over their heads almost the whole year but it all caught up to them in one 00game streak i am as old as 0000 man and i was a big phillies fan at the time age 00 september 00 is still a painful thing to remember but i can tell you that the phillies never led the league by 00 that year going by memory alone i believe their biggest lead was 0 00 games and they were 0 00 ahead when the famous 00game losing streak began a streak during which it seemed that they found just about every way to lose known to man anyway i think they rebounded just before the end and won their last couple games and were still in the thing until the final day but finished tied with the giants one game out and didnt the dodgers or somebody else finish two games back that has to be one of the closest last minute scrambles ever  ok you guys stirred up my childhood memories so i went and did some research on the final month or so of the 0000 season it turns out that my

were really overused at least by the fourman rotation standard of the day until well along into the 00game losing streak at which time mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the phillies substantial lead had evaporated the way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse although bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 000 shutout of the reds that cost the reds a share of the pennant bunning pitched a complete game sixhitter striking out five and walking one it would be inetersting to see though how the total innings for the year for bunning and short stacks up against the rest of the league also notice that the phillies played every day from at least september 0 through october 0 while they didnt play substantially more games than the other teams the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch   eric smith ericsnetcomcom ericsinfoservcom ci 000000000

  rbis and runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics  you can talk about obp and slg all you want but the fact remains  the team that scores more runs wins the game   flame away  so what does that have to do with rbis  the team with the most rbis doesnt necessarily win the game  yes runs are the most important statistice  for a team  so why does every newspaper rank team offense by batting average  but for an individual player runs and rbis are contextdependent and tell us very little about the player himself and more about his teammates and position in the batting order   ted frank                   thf0kimbarkuchicagoedu          im sorry the card says moops the u of c law school       standard disclaimers

  i love it how all of these people are blaming the phillies success  on a weak division  why dont we look at the record of the teams in  each division read interdivisional play well see that the east  is really kicking the shit out of the west  i know it is early but  that is all we have to go on  atlanta is just so strong with their  000 ba cincinnati is 00 coming off a sweep at veterans stadium in  philadelphia and houston was swept in its first three games by the  phillies in the astrodome  that my western division friends shows  that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you  think  phils all the way in 00 braves hit like a aaa club reds need marge  bob  
  i have noticed that this year has had a lot of high scoring games at least the nl has  i believe one reason are the expansion teams  any thoughts   charles  
  gt0000aprismgatechedu brian r landmann writes   joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball  for anyone who didnt see sundays game  with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers  later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a 000 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea a 000 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  what the hell is he thinking  for your information lankford is injured i think it is his shoulder or rib cage so he could not use him as a pinch hitter   earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said he liked gilkey coming off the bench  gilkey hit over 000 last year what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every team in the league  i do believe that whiten was a very good aquisition for the cards  he does not have too much offensive capabilities but he is an awesome defensively since when have the cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense i forgot who st louis gave up for him but it was not too much   as far as gilkey is concerned he is a leftfielder and so is brian jordan who beat him out  i expect to see a gilkeyjordan platoon in lf   furthermore in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home  i agree with you on this one  as soon as larkin threw that ball i knew that lankford was a dead bird  but how could dent have known that larkin would make a perfect throw   i strongly believe that torre is one of the best managers in baseball  dont forget the overachieving cards of 00 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place although they were oveshadowed by the braves twins last to first climb  he won a division title and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the braves why atlanta ever even considered firing him i will never understand  with torre at the controls the cardinals are heading in the right direction   one more thing one game does not make a season  yes they lost to the reds but with the second best pitching staff in the national league first in the east and a pretty good offense the redbirds will win a lot more than they lose  maybe this is the year that they will go all the way   charles a very enthusiastic cardnials fan        º charles rosen            º      thirtyfour to thirteen    º   º university of alabama    º   national champs  roll tide º   º tuscaloosa al           º         need i say more         º

     not clear to me at all  id certainly rather have a team who was winning  00 games than 00 games  in the 00 game luck is going to play a much  bigger role than in the 00 game   but you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to one run  sam    sherri nichols  snicholsadobecom

  was going over some videos last night   and you wrote an excellent report about it   0  hes bulked up too much  period  he needs to lose about 00 pounds     not gain more bulk  0  his bat speed has absolutely vanished  conservatively id say hes     lost 00 of his bat speed and thats a huge amount of speed  0  that open stance is killing him   note that he acts sort of like     brian downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is     released  downing could do this without significant head movement      canseco cant  also note that canseco doesnt always close his     stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes     theyre fully closed  without a good starting point its hard     to make adjustments in your swing   i understand from an unreliable source that canseco was considered expendable by the as when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance  the as brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated if not caused by having a wide open stance closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque thats a paraphrase of what i remember  in any event canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance and the as began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power    aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch so that id never have to work again id restructure my entire swing  apparently you sound like larussa  second drop 00 pounds  cut out the weight work  the as also objected about this   if cansecos open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems hell be out of baseball in three years  if not he could still hit 000 hr  again im just repeating something i heard  but possibly the cause and effect is the reverse of that      the beastmaster     mark singer     mssnetcomcom

   no hes not nuts wip is second to none the sports station  they dont have tony bruno working espn radio and al morganti doing friday night hockey because they suck  i live in richmond va but i visit phila often and on the way i get wtem washington and wip  i hear the fan at night wherever i go the signal used to be wnbc when they played golden oldies because you cant avoid it  of those three wip has the best hosts hands down  chuck cooperstein isnt a homer and neither is jody mac  wtem is too generic to be placed in the catergory  in fact if you have heard wtem and the fan you notice the theme music is identicalsame ownership i think so  wip is totally original  their hosts actually have a personality this is a knock at tem the team not the fan because mike and the mad dog and sommers are good i mean comparing the morning guys in philadelphia to the ones in washington is a total joke  anyway i like the fan and wip but i think the edge goes to ip    when i get back from philly i go into withdraw cause richmond has nada except the national sports line and those guys are totally clueless    i was really mad when wcau was cancelled because they had steve fredericks doing sports phone after the phillies games  wcau is another strong station now its an oldies station but they still have the phillies i started listening to the fan because i heard he went there  i finally heard him last summer and he wasnt the same guy  those ny fans got to him  i was glad to hear him back in philly when i went to see a few eagles games     i will admit i am  die hard eagles fan and wip is basically an eagles station 000 days a year  but i bet you the phillies are in control right now   about the knock on g cobb i like him  he knows the eagles like a book  i remember the weekend before they went to play san fran when everyone thought the eagles would be blown away cobb said that the eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win well they were inches shy of pulling the victory    well thats my 00  
   since someone brought up sports radio howabout sportswriting  anyone give an opinion   which city do you think has the best sports coverage in terms of print media   these are general questions   is the washington post better than the philadelphia inquier or the ny times    howabout the philadelphia daily news compared to the new york daily news     do you notice papers being subjective or objective to the home team   
   something else to consider  alomars hr splits were 000000 slg 000000 obp baergas was 000000 and 000000 pretty clearly alomar got a huge boost from his home park  not necessarily  it could mean that or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road see frank thomas homeroad splits in 00 for an example  i would guess that some of alomars split is due to the skydome but most of it is probably due just to coincidence theres no way to be sure of course but the only hitters the skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters and alomar is not a home run hitter  id say you could make a good for them being about equal right now tp rated baerga higher actually  only because of tps bogus fielding stats which rate alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league  on a career basis i think tps fielding stats may mean something but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this  alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is but he sure isnt the worst in baseball  offensively tp rate alomar much higher last year  regarding the a vs b argument ill just say theyre both very good players with different strengths and a bright future   greg

   i dont have a history handy but i dont recall that the preponderance of roys come from winning teams  in fact i think team performance is generally irrelevant as almost always the most deserving candidate wins am i wrong  not really though i wouldnt personally say the most deserving candidate wins  rarely does a player win roy when called up in mid season and there have been several duds in recent years  but this is more a factor of mediot biases than anything else  i wonder  if amaral hits like he is capable of will he receive roty votes  hes only 00 he could have a long career ahead of him    and he is not necessarily on a losing team  while the angels staff is still very weak their everyday lineup is doing quite well thank you  snow is playing great  salmon is learning to make the adjustments easley appears fine but even if hes not flora is ready to come up between gonzales and gruber theyll manage the hot corner  polonia and curtis are steady and heady  even myers and orton are contributing  personally i think they can finish over 000 which makes them a  winning team  i think they are a seconddivision team  they should finish ahead of the royals mariners and possibly athletics  but i dont think theyll be above 000  i think the east is stronger this year  last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible  this year their offense is better but their pitching is still pretty bad even if finley returns to form he wont replace what they lost in abbott  sanderson  farrell  i dont believe it  and while their ba may be good and they have decent speed their offense lacks punch  they dont have any bona fide power hitters salmon snow davis and curtis  none with more than 00 hr potential  cheers valentine  ps which al team had the most steals last week  those gogo tigers the mediots finally managed to convince them that they needed more balance in their lineup  you see they were scoring too many runs too consistently  gotta run more to break that up

     not clear to me at all  id certainly rather have a team who was winning  00 games than 00 games  in the 00 game luck is going to play a much  bigger role than in the 00 game   but you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to one run  yeah but whats your point  you still need the offense to score more runs than you allow too    the braves do have a fine pitching staff  but thats still only half the game    sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

    i agree though id also be happy with a stadium that looks  like new comiskey the new park was also made for baseball  unlike three rivers the vet riverfront etc its not a  football park in which they also play baseball   while were on the multipurpose subject lets not forget shea which was designed to accommodate both the mets  jets  it was the first stadium i think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football  of course with the jets gone to jersey and a truly good football stadium the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where because its circular the seats are almost always too far from the action  the mets announcerskiner  murphy in particularhave always hyped it as beautiful shea stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is  jay

    the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to death but i havent seen anything in rsb yet  gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run  he stroked a line drive into the right field corner  the ball cleared the threefoot high fence and went into the crowd  darryl racing over from right center got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he missed the ball  a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt reached up and caught the ball  home run  now ive seen the replay several times and i have concluded that darryl missed the ball and that the fans glove was essentially behind darryls  several dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with strawberry  what cannot be disputed however is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing  he was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch  that exuberance disappeared immediately however when strawberry went into a tirade at the man  all reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of costing the dodgers a game  shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch  dodger stadium officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and just relocated him to another area  in an interview after the game lasorda blamed the fan for the loss  strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they dont care about  winning  la times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch  before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play  was the fan wrong  should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference  or was he human and just reacting  by the way he is a season ticket holder and on his request the dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the stadium where future interference is impossible  others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 0 rbi through the first nine games  i question what he was doing in right center with a lefthanded pull hitter up and the game on the line  had he been closer to the play he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball  but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan    the beastmaster      mark singer     mssnetcomcom  
  went to the dodgers game tonight  it was cap night   astacio pitched ok but had control trouble all night in the first he walked a batter balked him to second then a single scored the run with the batter taking second on the throw home  another single made the score 00 cards   lasorda tried a new line up featuring butler reed and piazza batting third  darryl and eric were benched in favor of snyder and webster   piazza homered in the first to make the score 00 cards the dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by offerman   by the fourth inning astacio had already made about 00 pitches but the score was still 00  the dodger defense made several impressive plays  piazza looked great behind the plate gunning down a runner trying to steal second throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base etc   karros also made a spectacular play keeping a ball from going into the outfield  the runner on first was so sure that ball was going through he just kept running past second  karros got up and threw to third and easily got the runner at third   my heart sank in the 0th when gross got up to warm up in the bullpen   astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter and when gross entered the game with the score still 00 dodger fans just knew it was over   gross was relieving because he stunk on tuesday pitching just 0 00 innings forcing lasorda to use much of his bullpen  the 00 inning game had the same effect the next nightso only gross was fresh given his light work out tuesday   gross lived up to his name  he walked the first batter gave up a hit to the second and walked the bases loaded  after a grounder resulted in a force at home zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 00 cards  gross paid little attention to the runners and the next thing you knew the cards had stolen a fourth run  the runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down but the 0th run had scored long before that   meanwhile the dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning lee smith pitched the ninth  he had little trouble getting karros and wallach does anyone have trouble with wallach these days cory snyder collected his first hit as a dodger a single but that was all the offense the dodgers could mount  smith got his third straight save against the dodgers and all i got was my free dodger cap and a good look at piazza  if piazza keeps this up all year he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors  though its really early karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year   the final scorecardinals 0 runs on 0 hits dodgers 0 runs on 0 hits   dodger

bear with me  in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball  we certainly believe this kid is going to be very good some day but there is really no need to rush him especially since we have a mega million dollar staff that is probably well served by a batterymate who is expereienced in game calling and pitcher handling  lopez time will come  lets give him some time in aaa   javy lopez has proven over 0000 ab in the minor leagues that he is ready to play in the majors he is not being rushed players who are clearly too good for aa and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them at aaa  no  maybe i need to improve my writing skills  lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age 00   unless lopez is me defensively im 00 000 and born to play second base  he belongs in the major leagues  training  what does he have to do to earn a chance  maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth  gee  i dont know  00 abs sounds pretty good to me  about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a backup role rather than start every day at aaa  talk about me as a gm  valentine isnt saying he should back up hes saying he should be put in a position to win the job in the major leagues which imho he would if given the opportunity val if im misinterpreting please let me know  so far you have come up with two arguments against lopez 0 he is very ordinary defensively 0 he is young and most players suck when they are young  the first is irrelevant  hes trying to make the majors with his bat and the second involves seriously warped reasoning  valentine  ok  most players are not ready for the bigs at age 00 see current related posting on clayton one of my favorites  most players  benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs  those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year  but the players who are ready are 0the best and 0 the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors javy lopez is not a middle oftheroad prospect hes the real thing now   again the most important thing a player can do is hit lopez does that miles better than olson or berryhill if his defense is good enough for greenville or richmond its good enough for atlanta if he really was awful defensively he would no longer be a catcher see sprague ed  now  the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners  not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops  the center field platoon will probably hit 000  however good lopez what they have to offset the differential in experience and  defensive ability  the kid will improve playing at aaa and he probably wont being a reserve with the big club    oh where to start ok first of all solid  good i want good players solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really arent very good at baseball think of it as twg without the caps its a losing strategy to say we have solid guys we dont need to improve you used it four times in that paragraph btw  same for experienced i might add though that greg olson and damon berryhill arent exactly carter and fisk olson has played three years berryhill five although 00 and 00 were a wash the only difference imho between olson and valle is the supporting cast  two big bats hrm i like justice but i find mr gants trend disturbing call it one and a maybe the braves platoon is ok but neither player has any value outside of the platoon bream vs lh and hunter vs rh are awful ill leave the thirdbase comment alone pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already if the cf platoon hits 000 ill retrace mr likhanis midnight run down forbes and i live in ny and la got that mike  and doesnt cox call pitches anyway  goodness  do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential why on earth do you people thinkthe braves made this decision are they idiots who have built this ballclub  jeeeesh  nope theyre baseball management possible the most shortsighted  collection of people in the nation do you not believe this goes on mark do you think frank thomas needed those three months in aaa in 0000 or cal eldred wasnt really better than ricky bones last year  and im the treasure  youre mostly polite make defensible if flawed

  a lot of teams carry 0 catchers on their 00 man roster but the 0rd catcher is seldom ever used  he is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 0nd catcher is injured during a game     so to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever why not invoke a catcher resubstitution rule  if the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game     given this rule a team wouldnt need 0 roster catchers  the 0rd catcher could be playing in aaa or be a nonroster bullpen catcher  ken

   not at all  i am talking about morris winning with toronto last year  you  are about to launch into a fantasy about the red jays and how toronto would have done with viola on their team  viola didnt play for toronto  last year  morris did  the problem with your nihilistic approach roger is that it takes all the sense out of the game  by your line of reasoning if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded theres no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do if his team won anyway or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons  after all any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didnt  roger do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead  or are you willing to consider empirical evidence  teams go to the postseason when they win more games than anybody else in their division  if they dont make the postseason they dont win the series  will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ringcollecting  if so you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games  in your viewpoint as expressed winning games happens for reasons that cannot be analyzed  while many of us are thinking things like base runners are good outs are bad and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded you are thinking things like its a team game so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today  the result is that it becomes impossible to say anything about individual players  perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me playing left field  after all perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it  therefore i could be an extremely valuable player  did dave winfield have anything to do with the jays victory  probably but how do you know if you replace him with andres galarraga perhaps the jays would have won perhaps they would have lost perhaps they would have defected to alpha centauri bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in midseason had winfield been dhing for toronto  was babe ruth a good player  he played on some wswinning teams but did he have anything to do with their success  it is generally accepted that ernie banks was a good baseball player and jarvis brown and dan schatzeder werent  it seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof  now we have observed things about baseball over the years both empirically and by looking at the rulebook  it is necessary to score more runs than ones opponent to win the game so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent ones opponent from scoring  runs are scored while a team is batting and an inning ends after the third out so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good  players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year  we do use these statistics to predict winners and so do you  to make some flat predictions  barry bonds will have a higher obpslg than gene larkin this year  the braves will finish ahead of the rockies in the standings  the tigers will score more runs than the royals but will also give up more  i would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false and i suspect so would you  as a matter of fact i am pretty sure i can predict all the division winners this year given 00 guesses per division and this is certainly better than random chance and almost statistically significant  if you will admit that the rockies and mariners are unlikely to meet in the world series you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods however fuzzy  it is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally meaningless  so how about real life  person a robs a service station with two people in it using a 00 automatic pistol gets 00 and is convicted and sentenced for three years  person b with a similar criminal record robs a service station with two people in it using a 00 revolver gets 00 and is convicted  since they used two different types of handgun are comparisons totally meaningless  say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works my cats are always testing this  they dont trust me to pay the gravity bill on time  you have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before so all previous evidence is meaningless  or would you be surprised if it flew out the window instead of hitting the desk  david thornley who has no replica world series rings but does have tickets to the 0000 world series in the metrodome

  kubeysgicom ken kubey said  i suppose a foul ball machine like brett butler is pretty valuable but id rather watch and root for the lower obp guys who can actually hit the ball  now this is a legitimate point  baseball is entertainment and i have no quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than others regardless of their winvalue  personally im a huge fan of the slugbunt i doubt its a highpercentage play but i get a big kick out of it  i am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun  of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that galarragas inability to defer gratification isnt hurting his team because he isnt paid to walk or is an rbi guy or whatever  and finally id like to point out that many high obp guys draw  their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them than because they have a great eye  im not sure  i used to think this was true but more and more im becoming convinced that its the other way around among players with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard the patient ones are the ones who get the chance to do it a lot  lets break down the four basic categories of hitter according to whether they are power threats and whether they walk a lot   powerno power  patientfrank thomasbrett butler barry bondsozzie smith mark mcgwirecraig grebeck babe ruthmiller huggins ted williamsbilly hamilton rickey hendersoneddie joost joe morganmike hargrove                       impatienternie banksozzie guillen dave kingmanshawon dunston joe carterandres thomas george belljose lind kirby puckettdevon white etc  as far as i can tell all the categories are full  it really looks like the two are independent  nobody could possibly be afraid of craig grebeck at the plate and yet he walks quite a lot  part of that undoubtedly is being small of stature but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of  target at least 0 times out of 0  randy milligan is an even better example hes only shown noticeable power for one partial season but he walks all over the place despite his huge strike zone        david m tate   dtatepittedu   greetings sir with bat not quick       member iie orsa tims sabr      hands not soft eye not discerning                                        and in denver they call you a slugger    the big catullus galarraga        and compare you to my own mattingly

  nichols writes in article 00000newsdukeedu fierkelabbchmbiochemdukeedu eric roush writes that hed been thrown out  and gant had a legitimate beef about the 00 pitch that was called a strike  a reasonable umpire would not have tried to force gant back into the box in that situation  a reasonable umpire would do as hes been instructed to do this season get the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous length of games  i for one am glad to see this happen and hope more umpires will do as hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if the batter wont get back in the box    so what if the previous strike call was bogus  its in the past it cant be changed get back in there and deal with the next pitch    sorry sherri but i cant agree with this particular incident  while im all for cutting down the number of chainrattles and other examples of rampant hargroving there was a difference here  0  since time immemorial batters have complained about calls so have pitchers and catchers  usually nothing happens unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints hirschbeck was acting against expectations  0  its not as if gant was in hirschbecks face  gant said something about the call stepped out of the box and turned away from hirschbeck  as a hitter alibet of little consequence but with a decent eye whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call id want a moment or two out of the box if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch  and if i was really angry at the ump id rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed especially at a key moment in the game  when gant turned away hirschbeck immediately motioned for gant to step into the box  imo at this point in time hirschbeck was determined to show gant exactly who was in charge of this game gant wasnt dawdling he hadnt had a chance to dawdle  and hirschbeck was simply exercising a power play  gant resisted as many of us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request and hirschbeck called for the pitch  at that point cox came out on the field the pitch was thrown and many other braves left the dugout  cox was tossed protecting his player  i was pleasantly surprised that gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game  its a small sample size but based on what i saw in that game mark hirschbeck has a hairtrigger temper and a need to play god on the field  not good qualities for an umpire  i will keep my eyes open for future appearances of hirschbeck in the  future in order to improve my sample size  imo any game where you remember the name of the umpire was a bad game for the umpire  eric roush  
   we cannot isolate the total contribution that any player at any position makes to his teams victory  and since we cannot make that measure with complete confidence of objectivity and since there is no absolutely  necessary reason to make that kind of subjective measurement i submit to  you that it is pointless  if a gm is trying to put together a winning team he might consider era he might consider attitude he might consider past performance in key situations  but what he is looking for is not  the player that he considers the best  the gm is looking for the player he thinks can help his team win  we cannot isolate completely roger but we can make a pretty good estimate i wont claim to split hairs and say that we can really measure who was better robby alomar or carlos baerga last year the difference is too close to call but larkin and lee clemens and morris the differences are too great there  in your measure of the game why should a team that has just won it all ever replace a single player since they are now clearly best how can they do better yet every team can always find someplace where they beleive they can improve the team they can always find a player a little better than one they already have btw by my definitions the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team win i will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team by having aptitudes one team needs more than others  baseball is a team game but it is made of individual talents it is absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success or failure of his teammates whom he did not choose at least in most cases morris won last year because he played on a team with joe carter robby alomar tom henke juan guzman john olerud et al clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as herm winninham luis rivera and jeff reardon to define the quality of the team as a sum of its components as i do albeit imperfectly is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the mean quality of the team as my reading of your arguments suggests you do  clay d

   a reasonable umpire would do as hes been instructed to do this season get the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous length of games  i for one am glad to see this happen and hope more umpires will do as hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if the batter wont get back in the box     a reasonable umpire would have recognized that ron gant was  disturbed with the call  a reasonable umpire would have realized that there was a 0run game in progress with two outs in the ninth  what ron gant did was try to regain his composure  what a normal baseball player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument with the umpire and since you cant argue balls and strikes he would have been ejected from the game  ron gant by trying to avoid such a conflict was penalized for showing some restraint  incidentally a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire as gant requested  if the home plate umpire had appealed to first the first base umpire could have wrung up the strike and gant would not have been so upset  if the call had been a ball and the catcher had requested the appeal it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help  finally the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the socalled efforts to speed up the game  the game was played very quickly it was just at 0 hours when the stuff happened in the ninth and the only delays in the entire game had been the result of actions by the umpires other than deion having to clean garbage off the field    econdukeedu     flsecondukeedu     flsecondukeedu    flseconduke s  to my correspondents  my email has been changed                       e l                         my new address is  flsecondukeedu            d f            if mail bounces try flsraphaelacpubdukeedu               u

   cox shouldve protested the game the second time the garbage got thrown at his outfielders  he should also have protested the game at the point where ron gant was assessed the second strike in the ninth on the grounds that he cox was on the field and time should have been called  both protests would be denied of course  the umpires judgement determines the garbage thing although i think the game should be called but thats my personal opiniondoesnt matter  there is time only when the ump says so the second argument is baseless   dave  
  the situation with the giants bleachers is a case in point for the need for a commissioner  this is true but the main thing the commish ie selig needs to do is to suspend bobby cox  you cannot allow a team to come out at the ump as the braves did  i usually rip umps but in this case the players were dead wrong  cox should go for 0 games  if i had ever umped a game where that happened id have ejected every player that came out  only cox and gant would have been spared and then cox would have gone in the ensuing argument  dave   
  btw by my definitions the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team win i will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team by having aptitudes one team needs more than others  well then given your definition of best is it not conceivable that alfredo griffin could bring something to a team that that team needs to win while larkin might not have that something the team needs  no  i do not find this conceivable  i also cannot conceive of the possibility that there is any hypothetical team which morris would help more than clemens  would griffin then be better than larkin  given your premise yes  but you are alone in your ability to conceive of that premise  valentine

  o any of you experts want to analyze ron gant is his early season slump because he is still swinging his bat the way he was last year trying to hit to all fields etc or has he changed his swing back to the old gant and is just in a small early season slump  is his spot int he lineup even secure especially the way he has been hitting    msilvermnyxcsduedugo cubs  one likes to believe in the freedom of baseball  geddy lee  
  does anybody know what is going on with lankford i know he was out for a few games with a slight injury but since he has beenback and before the injury for that matter he has been really struggling at the plate and on the basepaths  whereis the ray lankford we saw last year    msilvermnyxcsduedugo cubs  one likes to believe in the freedom of baseball  geddy lee  
  i always thought that a reasonable means of measuring value between players was to attempt to determine if a team would trade one for another  the major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age  even if morris were performing as well as clemens right now and were likely to this season nobody would trade clemens for morris straight up because clemens has more of his career left  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

      i suppose a foul ball machine like brett butler is pretty valuable    but id rather watch and root for the lower obp guys who can    actually hit the ball  and id rather watch and root for a team that scores lots of runs and wins games  of course im rooting for the rockies and andres anyway  but thats for irrational hometown reaons  i also root for frank thomas   david paschich

cs000000arielyorkuca shawn luddington writes hey valentine i dont see boston with any world series rings on their fingers yah  so damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his  future he certainly didnt earn his last one  how many games did he blow in the world series  all of the ones he started he certainly did earn it  he was a valuable member of the blue jay team   not particularly in the world series during the season he was probably more valuable than say putting olerud out there to pitch but yeah he was valuable in getting them there in the postseason he sucked dirty canal water through a straw the jays won in spite of morris much more than because of him  therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing oh yes  definitely  therefore morris is better than clemens your definition of better refers to some measurement on a scale that has nothing to do with winning ws rings  umm roger return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago where the poster valentine was replying to used  of ws rings as a measure of better the concept is called context and you should really become familiar with it someday  the facts are that morris has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a ws winning club clemens hasnt  unless this transaltes to clemens hasnt gone into lou gormans office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until hed been traded to the jays im at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it  you can go on about what clemens has done in the  past and claim that he is better than morris if you want to  but  the facts are that morris has shown us that he can win and clemens hasnt  what on earth does this mean over their careers clemens has won 00 of the games hes started morris 00 per year clemens has averaged nearly 00 wins morris just under 00 would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game if so then consider that clemens allows 00 runs0 innings pitched morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings in fact jack morris has never in his career had an era for a single year as good as clemens career era but i forget in the maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to buckner missing that grounder in 0000 had morris been on the sox it would have been a routine groundout right  whether or not clemens is better by your standard of measurement is totally meaningless  the object of the game is not to compile  high figures in statistics that you have chosen to feel are important the object of the game is to contribute to ws victories  but this has been patiently explained to you many many times and you are  either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it  speaking of stupid it has been patiently and notsopatiently explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask  dont give me that shit  if boston had alomar olerud henke and ward while toronto had rivera jack clark jeff reardon things would have looked a little different last fall  give credit where credit is due  this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick yes and the dog would have caught the rabbit tooforget about what didnt happen and open your eyes for once and look out there and see what is really happening  forget about how morris shouldnt have won 00 with an era over 0   when morris pitched last year the jays won  stop crying about it and get on with life  no one is crying the jays won and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the al east they performed well in two short series and won the world series and i congratulate them for it as a red sox fan i hope they keep morris i was happy when they picked up stewart and elated when they traded for darrin jackson you see unless you believe in some mystical link between morris and the offense you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky luck runs out just like it did in 0000 when he pitched 00odd more innings than 0000 gave up exactly one earned run more than in 0000 and went 0000  seriously roger id really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 0000 morris and the 0000 morris which one was a better pitcher and why did morris somehow learn how to win in the intervening ten years if so then why did he go 0000 in 0000 with minnesota with an era over half a run lower than 0000   mike jones  aix highend development  mjonesdonaldaixkingstonibmcom  dont be humble youre not that great

  maynardramseycslaurentianca roger maynard writes it sure does  and it all depends on the definition that you use for better yours is based on what could have been and mine is based on what really happened  well actually most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened but thats ok i understand you have a hockey background stats like plusminus make rbi look good  is it violas fault that boston had no offense  is it because of morris that the blue jays had such a strong offense  dont tell me that morris has this magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs this is the perfect example of your problem  you are isolating violas contribution from the rest of the teams efforts  you can only do this if you can say for sure what the team would have done without  viola  only then can you compare  but you cannot know how the team would have done without viola  your analysis is fallacious  ok how about a straigh answer then heres a very simele question to which im sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to please answer yes or no roger  can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs al only please  for anyone else following along it is a wellknown and demonstrable fact that a teams winloss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows its not a definite hardandfast function but there is definitely a correlation in fact as a rule of thumb if teams a and b both score x runs and team a allows y runs for every 00 runs fewer than y that team b allows it will win another game so for instance if we look at the 0000 toronto blue jays we find that they scored 000 runs and allowed 000 of which morris allowed 000 all other things being equal if frank viola with his 000 era had replaced jack morris for the 0000 innings morris threw plausible since viola threw 000 for boston the red jays would have allowed about 00 fewer runs or enough for 00 more wins now that doesnt take into account that viola pitched half his innings in fenway which is a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander than skydome so um roger unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that viola would necessarily have put up a 000 if he had been on the jay last year but that is not the claim we look at what the actual performances were and evaluate violas as better than morris in the sense that had morris performed as viola did his team would have been better off  it takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out here in the real world guys  this is true but not so open that your brain falls out   mike jones  aix highend development  mjonesdonaldaixkingstonibmcom  computerif you dont open that exit hatch this moment i shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large ax got that  zaphod beeblebrox  
   yes  everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are  finally moving in the right direction  they should finish over 000 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race  in august  however i would take back a few moves  0  the jim abbott trade     i think abbott is not only an inspirational person but a     great pitcher also  he could win the cy young this year      but he wont because the right side of the yanks infield     isnt good enough  so why was this not a good trade       jt snow  how many rookies have been able to step in and     immediately have the impact that he has had so far on      the angels  i know its early but if youve seen this kid     hit field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be      a tremendous player  the yanks should have kept him  what     about mattingly you ask  well  its great that the yanks     have taken care of him and remained loyal but hes 00 years     older than snow and just doesnt have the same bat speed as     before his back injury  its a shame but as a yankee fan      who wants to see the best yankee team id take      snow over mattingly at first  the yanks also gave up two     promising propects with snow for abbott  besides with     domingo jean brien taylor wickman militello and sterling     hitchcock they are just loaded with propects  i know abbotts     only 00 but this was too much to give up  i believe george     forced this trade because he believes and hes right that     abbott will be a big hit in ny  however id like to see the     yankees build a baseball team not an amusement show  0  wade boggs     i live in boston and like wade a lot  but his career is      winding down and i would rather see the yanks start to develop     a long term solution ie hensley muelins russ davis velarde     besides wade just doesnt have any range  what a shame about     charlie hayes huh  0  spike owen     see wade boggs  id much rather see them develop dave silvestri     or whoever  wade and spike next to each other in the infield is     going to raise the yankee staff era 00 point  and these guys     are on the down sides of their careers  0  danny tartabull     yes  hes put up some tremendous numbers and its nice to think     about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year  but he     never is  we should expect 000 games max out of him  meanwhile     gerald williams is playing at columbus and paul oneil is playing     left field  i believe oneil led nl outfielders in assists     last year  and tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder  what im basically getting at is the yanks are moving in the right direction but are not ready to win a pennent this year  they should at the gm level be planning for a 0000 or 0000 world series  this means getting the younger players experience in the majors now so they  will be ready in a year or two    im afraid that all this stuff wreaks of george steinbrenner certainly the boggs deal was all george  it looks like george is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now  the veterans are always available and can be added at any time like boston did this year  develop the young players first then add the one or two veterans or in the yankees case just keep them  lets all us yankee fans hope that george doesnt dismantle the terrific job stick and company have done building the yankee organization back into one of respect  im really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today relief pitching for example  george must realize that the yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away  have patience george and we will all enjoy the future  fire bucky and trade the kids and its baseball hell for all loyal yankee fans for a long time  sam im not militello or millitello mandelbaum

   havent been to many as games have you  theres also a difference in how tolerant i am of long games if im watching them on the tube and if im going there in person  for me going to an as game has become a major commitment of time one that im not willing to make that often  the length of their games is costing the as revenue from me  i stopped going to as games some years ago while i still lived inthe bay area for exactly this reason  i believe the length of their games has been institutionalized by larussaduncan  they encourage their pitchers to be overly deliberate to throw to first often to study the catchers signals and so on  and almost every as hitter takes a step out of the box after every pitch  this is not imo a coincidence this is planned  and i hate it  as for the gant situation i did not see the game or the replays  but i do wonder  what if gant had requested a time out  would hirschbeck have been required to give it to him  could he have denied the requst for all he the ump knew gant could have had dirt in his eye       mark singer     mssnetcomcom

   thats very true  i live in richmond home of the aaa richmond braves and they have this guy ryan klesko who hit 00 hrs at home last year  now that doesnt sound like a whole lot but the way the diamond is built home runs are a rarity   in fact ron gant brian hunter and david justice all proved they could hit in richmond  when they were sent to the majors they never came back if you can hit in richmond you can hit anywhere    so far after beating scranton phillies 00 in the first game the best team in aaa history has been rather underwhelming  too many expectations i guess

  me too rbi are a worthless stat of course so is stolen bases because  sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run and of course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases so batting average slugging and obp out too  hmmm i guess homers would not count then either my point rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is and no stat or lack of can tell me there are no clutch hitters maybe no stat can tell me either but some people are i just know it 0  but why would you want to use rbi   rbi is an attempt to measure is some combination of clutch hitting and power hitting  if you believe in clutch hitting then look at how the guy hit with risp  if you want to see how good of a slugger he is then look at his slugging average    in terms of evaluating players rbi totals are better than nothing  but why use them when so many better stats are out there   david frohardtlane   dflmathwayneedu   go tigers lions pistons red wings and wolverines

  npr this morning had an interview with linda mccarthy name possibly garbled by me an official historian for the cia  she has won an emmy for research on moe berg for a tv documentary which i know from nothing but which sounds good  she said that among other things berg was the  principal spy for the oss cias wwii precursor spying on axis atomic programs because of his physics background and language skills  she said that during the war he met with heisenberg in switzerland and had  instructions to shoot heisenberg if the germans were close to us in bomb research he concluded they were two years behind and didnt shoot him i have heard elsewhere that heisenberg deliberately misled the nazi bomb program but i dont know how reliable this is  unfortunately npr didnt mention any kind of a book shes writing  id certainly buy it  in case youre wondering about baseball relevance berg was a longtime mlb backup catcher  he was a member of an mlb allstar team that toured japan in 0000 presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few americans much less mlb players who spoke japanese photos he took of tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids according to mccarthy  dave mb   
  snicholsadobecom sherri nichols writes  stuff about ron gant incident deleted   a reasonable umpire would do as hes been instructed to do this season get  the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous  length of games  i for one am glad to see this happen   i agree that hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do and also that gant should have listened to him  however what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games  you are the first person   nonmediot  i have seen endorse this policy  i have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the espn crowd  and other announcers  bitching about it  i have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and shouting hurry up  if i cough up big bucks for a  ticket i dont mind a game that last more than 000  i really dont understand it    games are longer now for several reasons  more pitching changes more basestealing  and throws to first  etci think a very small factor is the increased time it takes jose canseco deion sanders insert fancy showboat ballplayer here to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the batters box  my impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this an issue because they like shorter games  they get to head back to hotel bar eat steaks get drunk tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase stewardesses around the bar  sure they want the game over with  print  journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games they have deadlines  the espn guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy  they constantly harp on this  primarily because they often have to work late  when the game goes longer than 000  maybe i am just a neerdowell with nothing better to do but i  would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you  as a parenthetical note it seems the league is in any case fighting a losing battle this year  the increased offense thus far will certainly  spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly  nick flynn

  kubeysgicom ken kubey writes and finally id like to point out that many high obp guys draw  their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them than because they have a great eye  this comes up periodically and i just dont get it take for example mark mcgwire he walked 00 times in 0000 if thats not a potential great example of what youre talking about then i dont know what is now lets look at what happens when mcgwire doesnt walk   00 of the time he made an out   00 of the time he hit a single   0 of the time he hit a double   00 of the time he hit a homer now youre pitching against mcgwire would you trade 00 walks for 0 homers 0 double 0 singles and 00 outs i would why give him the base when you can get him out 0 times out of 0 then there are guys like alex cole who has a career 000 obp even though hes never had a batting average over 000 he did hit 000 in 000 ab in 0000 or hit a single home run yep thats right hes never hit a homer in 000 abs through the end of 0000 whod be afraid to throw a strike to him   mike jones  aix highend development  mjonesdonaldaixkingstonibmcom  ive never been prejudiced by sex entertained yes but never prejudiced  justice dan snow walter matthau  
  tim shippert recently posted summaries of last years defensive average stats in terms of the linear weights estimated runvalue of defensive performances compared to league average  ive combined those with my positionadjusted mlv numbers to come up with firstapproximation total run values for players last year  we can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the mvp award  major caveats  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment so if san diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield that will cause some inaccuracies  the offensive numbers are positionadjusted but not park adjusted so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair  finally we still dont know what to do about catchers and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions  of tony phillips and bip roberts    having said that there are still some surprises  lets look national league first  all numbers in total runs contributed over the season  playeroffensedefensetotal  sandberg  00  00 00 bonds  00   0 00 walker  00  00 00 justice  00  00 00 daulton   00   00 larkin  00   0 00 grace  00  00 00  as i see it these are the legitimate mvp candidates from last season if you deflate sandbergs offense a wee bit for playing in wrigley you get essentially a dead heat  had bonds been his usual defensive self it wouldnt have been close but that apparently wasnt the case  darren daulton needs 00 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference and i couldnt tell you whether thats easy or impossible  a good case  could be made for any of sandberg bonds or daulton as top dude  my personal vote  bonds sandberg daulton walker justice   in the american league  playeroffensedefensetotal  ventura  00  00 00 martinez  00  0 00 b anderson   00  00 00 thomas  00  0 00 r henderson  00  00 00 raines  00  00 00 tettleton  00   00  ok lets see a show of hands how many of you picked robin ventura as top player in the al last year  i certainly didnt but id have a hard time arguing against him at this point  yes i know these numbers are only approximate but thats a big gap between him and the 0 guy  also those of you who thought rickey henderson stank last year are out of your minds  once again theres a catcher in the ointment  if calling a game is as important as it might be 00 runs is easy to make up or give away  take a guess folks i dont think we can do any better than that  my personal vote excluding pitchers  ventura tettleton anderson martinez henderson  im a big frank thomas fan but i have to admit to a bias in favor of balanced offensivedefensive contribution which should have a higher leverage in wl record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with negative defense  for the record  carlos baerga  00  0  00 roberto alomar  00 0  00  forget it its a wash  let me also take this opportunity to admit that i was grossly wrong regarding don mattinglys defense this past season  don recovered brilliantly from his weak 00 and 00 to end up with  mattingly  0  00  00 runs  which is clearly an aboveaverage first baseman  however its still 00 runs behind mark mcgwire 00 runs behind frank thomas and 0 runs behind john olerud  on the other hand its ahead of rafael palmeiro cecil fielder and every other al first baseman not yet mentioned       david m tate   dtatepittedu   greetings sir with bat not quick       member iie orsa tims sabr      hands not soft eye not discerning                                        and in denver they call you a slugger    the big catullus galarraga        and compare you to my own mattingly

    before folks jump on me let me ask the net  would the jays  have won the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morris given  his run support  how about an average ml pitcher  i cant believe  that morris performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive  impact on the jays performance   i know its very trendy nowadays to dump on morris but lets give credit where credit is due  it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris last year when the team went 0000 for the month of august and all the  other starters were being shelled and milwaukee was making a charge morris went 00 with a pretty good era i cant remember exactly also lets not underestimate the importance his 000 innings to save  the bullpen every fifth day  if he didnt help us win the al east forget about the pennent and the world series  his run support was high 000 runs but so was stottlemyers 000 runs and he won only 00 games  i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of 00 and 00 ballgames but this is to his credit  he pitched only as good as he needed to be  when he was up 00 in a ballgame he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out i hate this expression  an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out  trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down  but morris being a  veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball  by saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra i hate this too when the game was on the line  yes morris is crapping out big time this year but lets not change history to suit the present    btw i think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a  veteran pitcher which cito would never do but his era is 00 how much more can he be embarrassed     from where i sit ill let others have the excellent players  ill  settle for good enough and the ring   ditto     joe leonard  jleworldstdcom    eddie   
   give jackson a breakhe lost about 00 pounds with that flu he had when he was traded   dj was a popular player in san diego derek bell was not faring well in the clubhouse at toronto so no matter how bad he looks now i still think it was a steal for the jays just from the perspective of team chemistry no statistic can describe it sorry statheads and since there are so many new faces in the clubhouse i think the jays are still trying to find it  insert the same comment into the jack morris v clemens ws ring string  yet at first i was sad to see derek go still anticipating all of the talent they raved about at the beginning of last season  im glad to see him faring well for the padres though                                       eric

   you want to speed up ballgames     0  mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches the current      rule is too lenient and then enforce it  fifteen seconds is more      than enough time  if the pitch isnt released in 00 call it a ball      and restart the clock   i remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work  i dont remember why they said that it did not work  anyone remember this  jody mcdonnel on wip in phil has been saying that a pitch clock was inevitable  how would a pitch clock work on throws to first  another pair of suggestions 0 remove the balk rule  it is the runners responsibility to stay safe    no matter what the pitcher does  0 if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time x  0 to 0    without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base    as if walked  the nobalk seems to give the pitcher the advantage  the basewalk allows the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base   baseball games take about 000 in the nl and just a shade under 0 hours  in the al  thats just too damn long  i dont like to play in 0 hour  games much less watch a game for that long  my butt falls asleep and  if im watching on tv ill channel surf between pitches catching  colorized versions of mr ed leave it to beaver and those wacky  nieporents on nick at nite  i too find myself surfing when i know that it will be enough time between each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his jewlery             gary huckabay    you think thats loud enough ahole                movie rights    well if youre having trouble hearing it sir        available thru    id be happy to turn it up for you  i didnt            ted frank     know that many people your age liked kings x     david madden

  the reason i bothered doing this dr stuff was to see if i could determine the answer to the ageold question is jeff blauser more valuable than rafael belliard  well it looks like just as doug trumped tim beating him to the net with his defensive analyses so tim has gotten in ahead of me  the way i was doing it was a little different being me of course i used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth and i calculated both rate of performance fielding equivalent average and total performance fielding equivalent runs but i compared not to the average player but the replacement player and heres why because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system in the al of 0000 the average ss is 000 runs above replacement rar cf 000 0b 000 0b 000 lf 000 rf 000 0b 000 we may quibble with the exact numbers but the order looks substantially right  in the equivalent average i have always set league average to 000 i had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of 000 the name of that replacement level hitter often as not is billy ripken i decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from 000 as 000 but in the opposite direction as i have set it up that makes for an eqa of 000 yes i can add runs are proportional to eqa squared the difference between 000 squared and 000 squared equals the difference to 000 squared and i rounded off for simplicity an allreplacement fielding team would have randy milligan at first 000 willie randolph 000 at second leo gomez 000 at third walt weiss 000 at short kevin bass 000 in left hojo 000 in center and eric anthony 000 in right ugh  so the total number of rar for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding rar i can rate them by total rar or rar per some number of batting outs like 000 an average player has a total rar of about 00 00 batting 00 fielding  total rar batfield  0 bonds      000 00000  ventura    000 0000 0 sandberg   000 0000   thomas     000 00000 0 van slyke  000 0000   anderson   000 0000 0 grace      000 0000   raines     000 0000 0 lankford   000 0000   puckett     00 0000 0 pendleton  000 0000   alomar      00 0000 0 finley     000 0000   martinez e  00 0000 0 bagwell    000 0000   mack        00 0000 0 butler      00 0000   mcgwire     00 0000 00 sheffield   00 0000   griffey     00 0000 00 larkin      00 0000   devereaux   00 0000 00 grissom     00 0000   henderson   00 0000 00 walker      00 0000   listach     00 0000 00 justice     00 0000   lofton      00 0000 00 w clark    00 0000   baerga      00 0000 00 kruk        00 00 0   d white    00 0000 00 o smith    00 0000   palmeiro    00 0000 00 gwynn       00 0000   sierra      00 0000 00 hollins     00 0000   carter      00 0000 00 j bell     00 0000   gonzalez    00 0000  notable entries in a per000 batting out rating nl top 0 are bonds 000 lf sandberg 000 0b van slyke 000 cf grace 000 0b larkin 000 ss justice 00 rf sheffield 00 0b one at each position measured mcgriff despite 00 batting rar fifth in league finishes out of the top 00 due to a 00 in fielding last by position  galarraga 00 stillwell 00 hansen 00 belliard 00 blauser gad a 00 0rd in league may 00 dascenzo 00 anthony 00  in the al muchmaligned rickey henderson was worth 000 second only to frank thomas 000 ventura edges edgar at third 000000 grebeck rates a potent 000 griffey edges puckett as top cf 0000 listach nudges out lofton among rookies 0000 and alomar clearly outpoints baerga 0000 last by position segui 00 sojo 00 palmer 00 lewis 00 polonia 00 cuyler 00 v hayes 00  all for now  clay d

          if i were the manager id argue that the runner was out of         the base line since he was to the left of the first base         line  if the umps dont budge which they wont  they nev         er admit when they are wrong id file a protest with the         league  rule 000k states it is interference by a batter or runner when  in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base  he runs outside the threefoot line or inside to the left of the foul line and in the umpires judgment interferes with the field er taking the throw at first base  the key word in the rule is and a runner isnt out just for running out of the baseline hes out for interfering with the fielding of the ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first because the catcher opted to throw the ball over the batterrunners head theres no inter ference    so what is your definition of interfering with the fielder taking the throw  the rule book certainly doesnt have a definiton or clarification so its possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter his throw to avoid hitting the batterrunner then again we have interference you know it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justlyif the catcher or the pitcher say rob dibble for example throws toward first and hits the runner running inside the baseline the fielder takes the chance of being ejected  therefore he probably would throw around the runner or your scenario above him  you should note that in our american legion league which uses mlb rules we interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there is interference per rule 000  rstimets    
  umpires are not required to call time out just because a player asks for time only in extreme cases like dust in the pitchers or hitters eyes should an umpire call time  the batter has 00 seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch im against putting a giant clock or any size clock for that matter up to count down 00 seconds between pitches and the minute for warmups but i think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever and instruct the pitcher to pitch the same goes for pitchers umps should tell them to pitch or feint within 00 seconds or a ball will be called thats the way it should be   ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine  io00000mainemaineedu  
  it depends if in the judgment of the umpire the batter made no attempt to avoid getting hit the batter is awarded first for a base on balls if the umpire rules he did try to get out of the way hes awarded first because of a hit batsman  ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine  io00000mainemaineedu  
  pitchers are required to pitch or feint or attempt a pickoff within 00 seconds after receiving the ball not 00  pitchers are required to pitch their warmup throws within a one minute time frame beginning after each half inning ends not two minutes  and the reason why a reliever should be allowed warmups is simple different mound different catcher  ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine  io00000mainemaineedu

  thomas theiner theindamabusinformatikrwthaachende wrote  hi there    im german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now  there are many problems occuring for me one of them is the era statistic for  pitchers what does it say   era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game  thus if a pitcher pitched 0 innings and gave up 0 earned run his 0 inning equivelent perfomance would be 0 earned runs thus his era is 000  to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 0  era  erip  0  an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error  more specifically if an error occurs that represented the third out all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game  here are some examples  if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base  if an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after this error and not counted as earned runs  if a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who were left on base  if the those runners who were left on base score and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game  i hope this explains things for you  joe

  dale seer stephenson writes while i can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around gant wasnt ordered back in the box sooner he was ordered back immediately as soon as he stepped out hirschbeck told him to get back in the box now gant doesnt take a lot of walks between pitches  the only reason he did then because he was very bothered by the call  i expect his concentration wasnt there yet and in a crucial situation i imagine its best to be as calm as possible  contributing factors would be gants bad day at the plate bad year at the plate and the braves long scoring drought  and it is not hirschbecks job to help gant with any of these difficulties if gant cant gather his concentration for whatever reason that just makes him all the more meat in the batters box  the umpires job is to  maintain flow of play  gant is not entitled to time to regather his faculties  nor is anyone else  now its pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there  you know the umpire is going to do something call for a strike throw you out etc  gant was wrong  absolutely  i think itd be more accurate to say gant was foolish  but hirschbeck was more wrong in my biased view  aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder what was the problem  gant had a reason to want some time disputed strike call    if a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout games would last about ninefifteen weeks if jack morris or dave whiner stieb were pitching  a disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out suck it up get back in the box and never badmouth the blue  theyre not going to change their mind and youre just going to come across as a pinhead which wont help you with the borderline calls  ftr  i never speak to umpires when i dont know them personally nor do i glance at them or react to calls  as a result i think i get more than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate because i have a rep of having a good eye  actually there are a lot of negative connotations that go with that rep including copious questions about my masculinity party affiliation and sexual preference  gant hadnt been wasting time all game  the game had been cruising along and was just over two hours old  irrelevant  he was wasting time then  the score was 00 with 0 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position is there any reason hirschbeck couldnt and shouldnt cut gant a little slack    0  because its not his job  0  because setting the precedent of cutting slack there can easily      extend to those 0 hour games  kind of like the phantom dp  for no discernible constructive reason hirschbeck disrupted the game caused a five minute delay and materially hurt the batter in a key situation  did he have a date to get to  gant hurt himself and the braves disrupted the game  your biases are exposed and im sitting here defending umpires and the sf giants which is like phyllis schlafly defending gary segura jack kevorkian and the swedish abortion team    and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game  i believe terry said the magic word  there are some truly quick ways to get tossed from a ballgame  for a primer email me  good ways to get tossed from a game  0  ask ken kaiser if he got his money back from nutrisystem 0  kiss rich garcia on the lips and say hi honey im home 0  goose eric gregg 0  ask bruce froemming if his parents had any children that lived 0  get naked  source the greg spira book of diamond ettiquette as told to  peter gammons  0000 collier press        gary huckabay    outside  that was right down the bleedin pipe   balder than any    kenny  i realize i dont have great control but    dave on the net   cmon  gary that was a styrofoam cup  the           really       plates a foot to your right  throw the ball     
   of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that galarragas inability to defer gratification isnt hurting his team because he isnt paid to walk or is an rbi guy or whatever  alright thats enough ive suffered with all kinds of insults as typical for the net but give me a break galarraga is currently batting over 000 and you guys are complaining that he isnt drawing enough walks  what would he have to do to please you guys bat 0000 you can hardly claim that he is hurting his team  if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen then i would agree with you that he isnt taking enough pitches my comment that he isnt paid to walk doesnt mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs its more along the lines of hes batting 000 and leading the league in rbis so what bloody difference does it make if he isnt drawing  a lot of walks sheesh  greg

   i dont think it was that obvious at the time that viola was better morris and viola had comparable kip ratios in 0000  viola was coming off an injury whereas morris was healthy  at the time i didnt really want the sox to sign either  i was more than a little worried about violas elbow  but you surely remember my shout of relief when after a week of rumors that morris was coming to the red sox they ended up with viola instead  now im even happier  viola seems to have rebounded nicely  also morris was willing to sign for only two years the jays dont like to sign pitchers to longterm contracts which i think is a sensible policy  how long did viola sign for  three years  i generally agree with their policy of avoiding longterm contracts for pitchers  but i think they enforce it rather too strictly  these days the premier pitchers all sign three or four year deals  which leaves the jays with morris and stewart  if the jays want to compete for top free agent pitchers they will have to accept greater risks  any idea what the option year deal is for morris  are there any automatic activation clauses  what is the buyout amountf  cheers valentine

      another pair of suggestions    0 remove the balk rule  it is the runners responsibility to stay safe       no matter what the pitcher does     0 if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time x  0 to 0       without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base       as if walked  this last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases considerably  suppose the pitcher uses up n0 of his n pickoff attempts  the runner can probably stretch his lead off the base given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it right this time  would this suggestion apply to pickoff attempts per pitch per batter or per base runner on the same base     dr edward j baranoski            mit lincoln laboratory             its got to be the going rm j000d po box 00                 not the getting there thats good lexington ma 00000                        harry chapin from greyhound 0000000000   
   alright thats enough ive suffered with all kinds of insults as typical for the net but give me a break galarraga is currently batting over 000 and you guys are complaining that he isnt drawing enough walks  what would he have to do to please you guys bat 0000 you can hardly claim that he is hurting his team  fine are you willing to bet that he will bat 000 the rest of the way  the point is that he has hurt the rockies so far its that he will hurt them eventually  just as much as he hurt the expos and the cardinals the past couple seasons  if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen then i would agree with you that he isnt taking enough pitches my comment  it has happened for the past 0 seasons where have you been  that he isnt paid to walk doesnt mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs its more along the lines of hes batting 000 and leading the league in rbis so what bloody difference does it make if he isnt drawing  a lot of walks sheesh  well see come september  i have an outstanding bet with someone that galarragas obp will be less than 000 on june 0   go california angels  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu

   the red sox usually have 0 catchers  i dont think they have a backup now but they used to use randy kutcher as a backup catcher as well as a middle infielder and outfielder  you dont need a good 0rd catcher just a competent one so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field         john carr jfcathenamitedu

       i hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of wfan and wipi go to school in philadelphia and i listen to both stations on a consistant basis  now that the fan has mike lupica on from 00 to noon they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews and not just of local importance he did have dave cheketts and fred wilpon on his show but he  had bob costas and magic johnson on too     now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent morning show   in my opinion i think imus is much better than bruno cataldi  and morganti even though i would feel different if morganti had a better crew of people to work with  to me wip tries to copy imus but make it all sports as a theme  in terms of sports imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves but he interjects humor and politics into his show 00 am to 00 noon   i think chuck cooperstein and lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show but i think chuck has the advantage over lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round  lupica and the other hosts on fan get better interview guests but i heard the pd of wip say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story   i would consider this even because they are two different styles of host  00 noon to 0 pm   at this point i would have to give a big advantage to  jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks  i just think jm has the ability to transcend the homer mentality of the philadelphia fan base  this is most evident when the igglesphiladelphia  spelling play the cowboys because jm is a huge dallas fan where else can you have people call up and predict a 000 score without the egging of the hostsrewip morning guys i do agree that jm was great on the fan weekend overnight and i miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts  i feel that jm is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin  if you are in ny and you cant get wip jm does fill in on the weekends sometimes  0pm to 0pm   this is the time when jm goes up against francesa and  russofatso and froot loops and i become the most divided in my loyalties  mike and the dog are very entertaining but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 00 to 00 minutes without talking about sports  matd do get great guests and that is the basis for their show so it is like the 00 to 00 debate  another plus is the appearances by mike and chris on imus in the morning which are often hilarious    0 pm to 0 pm   matd go up against fredericks and missanelli  i like mike missanelli but i just cant stomach steve fredericks   i know that sf came from philly originally but when he was at the fan he was a ny homer as much as he is a philly homer now  i dont listen to wip much after 0 pm unless there is a game on that night but you will see later for the  reason  that is why i give the advantage to fan  0 pm to midnight   sm are on wip until 0 and then it is the man who makes eli that calls matd all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism g cobb  this man is so grating on my nerves that if i listen to him for a few minutes i go nutsi know that is biased but listen to his show on fan there is usually a game on knicks rangers mets jets or st johns basketball  if the game is on the west coast then it is usually howie rose  of course i think dead air would be better than g cobb on wip but wip does air sixers and flyers games during the season if this is the sports station why did they lose the iggles to wysphome of howard stern in phil during the summer it is all talk on wip   overall i would have to give the advantage to wfan with the exception of 00 to 00 and 0 to 0 where it is even and 00 to 0 where wip has the advantage                   rich     youve read the hat now see the movie                    imus in the morning    a blurb youre a blurb                    seinfeld

  off and on over the last several months threads about rbis and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can  predict a players rbis using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position risp that he bats with  in the brock0 model bill james calculated predicted rbis as rbi000total bases  home runs  this  completely ignores the context which was all that brock0  could do since context was unknown to it  so i thought id take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing rbihome runs to slgrisp  ive started with team data using data from the eliass that ive picked up over the years when a i could afford them and b i could stomach the thought of increasing eliass profits that gave me the years 00000000 0000 and 0000  i dont  have team rbis for 00 or i could add that year  if you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   rbihome runs  000slgrisp  the correlation between the lhs and the rhs is 000 which is significant at a ridiculously high level  so i feel like the fit is good at the team level  ive no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 0 players will clark ozzie smith joe carter and don mattingly  i hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year  it doesnt do too badly except the equation underpredicts the low hr hitter smith which may be a fault of the model or it could just be ozzie  the results                             rbihr          years        actual   predicted carter  000000     000       0000 clark   00000000  000       0000 mattly 000000     000       0000 smith   000000     000       0000  i think we can make a case and i hope to make it stronger that rbis can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up  more later harold   harold brooks                    hbrooksuiatmaatmosuiucedu national severe storms laboratory norman ok i used to work for a brewery too but i didnt drink on the job p bavasi on dal maxvills view that florida can win the nl east in 00

  just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the dodgers one of  my least favorite in la sweet  also the mets my other least  favorite team loss to the rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the cardinals are on the espn tonight  big lee smith is having a great start and the cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs  hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training the runners lob will be lower this year probably due to the high strikeout numbers by jose and lankford and zeiles off year  i dont know why all the fuss about the fillies  the media and all the  filly fans on rsb forget who is right behind them in the standings   give the wild thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games  and well see who is in first then  i believe the cardinal pitching  staff is more complete than the filly staff and that will make the difference  on a side note a few years ago 00 a comment was made by some  baseball player or manager about the dodger defense  he was asked  where to hit the ball against the dodgers and he replied fair  i  remember it being in the they said it section of sports illustrated i would like to know who said it and what issue it was in  go redbirds  gary wieman

    most of the points you made about lopez v berryhillolson have been made by others and realizing that lopez must be the second coming of frank thomas i have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters   nope theyre baseball management possible the most shortsighted  collection of people in the nation do you not believe this goes on mark do you think frank thomas needed those three months in aaa in 0000  see  this is essentially what everyone was doing    comparing lopez to one of the best players in the game  im really looking forward to seeing this cantmiss superstar now  as for thomas i remember being an advocate of his being brought up in 0000 even though he was only 00 or 00 cant remember  but who did the sox have at first calderon  martinez  kittle  the spot was there  the talent was there  sure i say go for it  i am not convinced that lopez is anywhere near as talented as thomas was after his aa season in 0000 and i am not convinced that olson berryhill are nearly as bad as kittlemartinez were  btw i dont think thomas was hurt by those three months      or cal eldred wasnt really better than ricky bones last year  well if we cant compare our guy to one of the best in the game lets compare our decision to one of the most boneshead right  cal eldred was 00 when he came up with a full season at aaa and a longer minor league career  frankly i dont know why he didnt make the club in 0000  bones is a year younger with a lousy prior history and just watching him makes me think that i missed a  career as a bigleague pitcher  no one   i repeat no one   laughed louder than i did at the sheffield trade  though i guess mieske has a future  i take it back mcilvaine may have laughed louder    youre mostly polite make defensible if flawed cases have wit and have in the past admitted being wrong that does qualify you on rsb well make an sdcn out of you yet    aw gee shucks  thanks guy  except i missed the part where sdcns admit theyre wrong    the beastmaster    mark singer     mssnetcomcom

   so who will start this years all star game for the al    probably alomar     not to put him down hes a great player but it helps to have   all the recognition hes had plus to play in a city which is  likely to pour in the votes  i like alomar  but id like to differ with your opinion about a city which is likely to pour in the votes  i attended many games last year during the balloting  i know that a great number of the attendees did not fill out their ballots but left them beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands  toronto gets no more and no less votes than any other city for the all star game  unfortunately this is not a one time thing  ive attended games during the last four seasons and it has happened every time  the apathetic attitude to all star ballots really offends me  ljs

  dak000svmasmsuedu said  nohal mcrae is the worst manager in baseball  ive never seen a guy who can waste talent like he can  one of the best rawtalent staffs in the league and hes still finding a way to lose  ill be surprised if he makes it through the next 0 weeks unless drastic improvement is made  im confused  how is it hal mcraes fault that he cant win with a team  whose best offensive player is phil hiatt  i mean lets be real  kansas city will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end up near 000 they have less offense than any other team in baseball even if you count the expansion teams        david m tate   dtatepittedu   greetings sir with bat not quick       member iie orsa tims sabr      hands not soft eye not discerning                                        and in denver they call you a slugger    the big catullus galarraga        and compare you to my own mattingly  
   one of the chapters in palmer and thorns hidden game is titled pitching is 00 of baseball implying that fielding is 0  how do they determine that  beats me  its been a long long time since i read it  this was my opinion the stupidest thing in the hidden game the argument was  0 defense or runs allowed is 00 of the game 0 unearned runs amount to 00 of the runs allowed earned runs 00  0 since unearned runs are the result of fielding not pitching and earned runs are the product of pitching not fielding fielding is 00 of defense and pitching is 00 of defense 0 caombining with 0 pitching is 00 of the game fielding 0  pete is usually sharper than that my own feel is that fielding is in the 0000 of defense range call it 0000 between fielding and pitching  one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around 000 and 00  id give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe 000 or even 0000 give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds identical batting stats which wouldnt be that unreasonable and even if you dont let roberto steal a single base theyll score a lot more than the oleruds by going firsttothird more often no offense gordon  clay d

  rvestermvmaccndedu writes  some discussion about whether elias is money grubbing deleted  funny it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks which are nothing but collections of statistics are authored by bill james and stats inc and howe for the minor league handbook  and i am not sure how the 0000 bill james player ratings book qualifies as a book with statistics while the elias analyst is a statistics book the analyst contains more stats sure but it also contains more dialogue  finally the point was not about the word statistics  it was about moneygrubbing  i dont see how anyone who has looked at the bill james player ratings book cannot consider him moneygrubbing  bob vesterman  some thoughts and facts  0  bill james is a partial owner of stats inc  however he has almost nothing to do with the daytoday operations of the company although he does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name the handbook but not the scoreboard  to the best of my knowledge the only things that bill actually writes for stats are the predictions section of the handbook and the bill james fantasy baseball rulebook  0 the debate over elias goes way back  bill james early stuff was hampered by the fact that elias would not give access to their stats at any price project scoresheet and later stats were founded to fill this void  you can call stats and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database and they will provide it  for a price of course  or you could just log into their online system and look at the data yourself  having attempted to pry numbers from elias in the past football not baseball they just dont do that  in stats eyes the high ground comes from making the information available at all  0  that being said im pretty dissapointed by bills book this year too i am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers  desire to have the book come out sooner than april  hope this makes things just a little bit clearer  bias alert  i am a former parttime employee of stats  noel rappin noelchaoscsbrandeisedu

  yes i could look it up but i prefer to post this question  to the net i read somewhere in a long forgotten article that the handsignals  used by major league umps were originally used to help a  deaf ball player by the name of dummy urban myth true  i gots ta know  dummy hoy a late 00thcentury baseball player was deaf  in order for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or strike the umpires developed hand signals  this also helped to relieve the stress on umpires vocal cords so they didnt have to shout strike or ball 000 times a game heard about this one from the only worthwhile baseball book john thorn has ever authored a century of baseball lore     mark b mbrownelalchemychemutorontoca  jason a miller some doctor guy frank tanana  0 win

   i agree with nick  whats the big deal about long games  if you want to watch baseball theres that much more baseball to watch  and yes baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves  i dont really mind the length of games either  if they want to speed the games up in sensible ways thats fine with me too  however what i object to is the assertion by baseball people whitey herzog buck rodgers are who ive heard say this that games are too long because hitters are taking too many pitches and that the strike zone needs to be expanded   john franjione department of chemical engineering university of colorado boulder franjionspotcoloradoedu

  hey folks  saw the giants play ball at the stick saturday april 00  it was the game where pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a twoout tworun homer to right to win it  it wasnt the game where the fans  threw the giveaway fotoballs onto the field in response to the homer  too bad huh  well the stick is still cold  the saturday game ended at 000pm and it was cold then  i cant imagine night games in april at the stick  the wind kicked up a little too and i got this idea  at most games theres a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on the field a lot of the time  i propose a kids cleanup corps composed mainly of 0000 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run out on the field in the fifth inning when the guy in the toro smooths the infield and grab the trash  it might not be glamorous but at that age i probably would have given anything to be on the field with the ballplayers  everybody wins here  whaddaya think  sean

  in kime00apr00000000mongoosetorolabibmcom kimemongoosetorolabibmcom edward kim writes  in article c0ro0hlwwworldstdcom jleworldstdcom joe m leonard writes   before folks jump on me let me ask the net  would the jays  have won the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morris given  his run support  how about an average ml pitcher  i cant believe  that morris performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive  impact on the jays performance   i know its very trendy nowadays to dump on morris but lets give credit where credit is due  it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris  well when you say without morris you have to mention an assumed replacement  if the alternative to morris was letting cito gaston softtoss the ball underhand to the opposition every 0 days then of course the blue jays wouldnt have won without morris  if the alternative was replacement level then i think it wouldve been very close and yes morris mightve made the difference  if the alternative was frank viola the blue jays probably would have won more easily with viola  last year when the team went 0000 for the month of august and all the  other starters were being shelled and milwaukee was making a charge morris went 00 with a pretty good era i cant remember exactly  yes  you can make the argument that the his presence prevented  the team from collapsing in august  also lets not underestimate the importance his 000 innings to save  the bullpen every fifth day  if he didnt help us win the al east forget about the pennent and the world series  those innings were probably helpful  his run support was high 000 runs but so was stottlemyers 000 runs and he won only 00 games  i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of 00 and 00 ballgames but this is to his credit  he pitched only as good as he needed to be  when he was up 00 in a ballgame he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out i hate this expression  an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out  trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down  but morris being a  veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball  by saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra i hate this too when the game was on the line  well i think is complete bs  what happened most of the time is that morris fell behind and the team came back and rescued him  mostly this is because hes a lousy 0st inning pitcher and much better the rest of the way  that the team can climb out of 00 00 holes consistently and win them 00 is not to morris credit its to the teams credit  furthermore while morris did exceed the wl percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support he hasnt done this in previous years  in fact his wl record in 0000 is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed do you think he just came up with this ability in 0000  look at the 0 postseason games he pitched decently in  typical morris games  morris gets behind team rescues him  hes not responsible for that rescue  and in both those games the team just didnt rescue him enough  jack morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those 0 games the offense just didnt earn him a victory  btw i think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a  veteran pitcher which cito would never do but his era is 00 how much more can he be embarrassed  morris is one of those guys who will reture when he cant start anymore hes too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen  greg   
  did anyone happen to see peter gammons on espn last night  he addressed this exact issue and dismissed it rather quickly  according to gammons advanced scouts are reporting that morris fastball and slider still have the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability to keep the ball hidden during his release  guzman and stottlemyre have gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a little work with the pitching coach  gammons looks to see morris back in top form within the month  i on the other hand still have my doubts  morris era last year was rather high for a pitcher who won 00 games  his showing in the series was not surprising  although im not convinced that hes washed up i have my doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the twins in 00  brian klaff   
  mzimmersnetcomcom michael zimmers writes  first a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball  i definitely do  thats why i dont like going to see games played on artificial turf   the lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches  and while its true that the gaps between plays can be interesting this is only true when they dont become extralong  well your idea of interesting differs from mine  i think batting practice is interesting for example and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it  i think the delaying tactics of batters pitchers catchers and managers are interesting because theyre attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game  of course the umpires can and should intervene when these tactics get out of hand  as ryan robbins has pointed out there are rules that cover this  one of the more fascinating things about baseball i think is its openendedness with regard to time  you never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours or if its going to go on until four in the morning  likewise some games are actionpacked and some games are slow and lazy  thats fine by me  those folks who want constant action should watch the games on tv so they can channel surf and cater to their short attention spans  heather hhendersonvaxclarkuedu

  is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly rbis this is the situation that brought the question up  the red sox were up in the bottom of the 0th by a score of 00  the mariners had the bases loaded with 0 out  the batter hits a fly to center which the fielder catches  the runner at third tags and scores without a throw    now without a judgement call and i dont think there is one this is an rbi for the batter  it seems to me that a better name for this would be defensive indifference since it doesnt really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point  i know i can think of several if the mariners stole third and second which opening the base would allow and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third he wouldnt have a play at home third or second for the out and maybe he therefore cant make the throw to first to get the last out etc scenarios too  but does it really matter if this guy scores this way when youre down by 0  if the tying run is going to score so is the guy on third  the point is that the batter imo shouldnt get credit an rbi for utterly failing to do his job  which at this point is to get a hit or a walk not trade an out for one run  what do you guys think  regards burke charles s homan chomanwpiwpiedu go red sox  000 go rocket 00

   as the heading indicates it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not batting 0th for the giants behind will clark  barry is such an awesome and consistent hitter  definitely the best in the national league  imho to  have williams a streaky hitter and not really a clutch hitter batting 0th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the giants  0 simple reasons  0   batting williams ahead of bonds will create a leftclark        rightwilliams leftbonds situation in the middle of the       batting order  this makes it tougher for opposing manager       to change pitchers  0   having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get       more good pitches to hit  this is important since he struggles       so much with breaking balls  opposing pitchers dont want to       walk williams to get to bonds   edward hui

   the phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings  last nights game was hard fought  the game in chicago should have been a blow out  all in all these two games show a different phillies team in past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 0 run games  i dont know how many times i saw them losing by only 0 run if they were able to win most of those they might have been more of a contending team  they are 00 so far in extra innings  and of course they are 000

  i like the clarkwilliamsbonds order pitchers can only walk clark with 0 outs unlike last year  williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming in the ondeck circle  since matt has a terrible batting eye this helps the giants a lot  when bonds gets on base all by himself he can try to steal 0nd and then be driven in with a single by thompson manwaring or clayton  if you bat bonds before the other sluggers then you dont want him to run because a caught stealing could take you out of a big inning  also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer a walk is a potential double  the only draw back is when clark and williams are clogging up the  bases infront of bonds and i think thats a problem the  giants will be glad to see especially if robby thompson gets hot  ken kubey         kubeywpdsgicom  000 0000000

  maynardramseycslaurentianca roger maynard writes  we have no way of knowing because we cannot separate morris contribu tion  from the rest of the teams  there is only one way of determin ing best in baseball  and that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game  each game determines which team is the best that day  at the end of the season the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division  the playoffs determine the best of the best  but the point is that the only decision making pro cess  used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re lates to the teams  not the individual players  there is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances  and that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game  and you know what  there is no such method inherent in real life either  so i would assume you would endorse the notion that we  cannot state with any level of objectivity that mother theresa has accomplished more good in this world than joseph stalin after all life on earth is a team effort  if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria then fine  but you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individuals  contribution  to  winning  the ws  because  that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the  context  of  base ball   so  until you can prove that clemens contributes to a ws cham pionship more than morris your evaluation of  clemens is totally  sub jective  and  is  mere opinion  i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon  have you tried glasses  i find them quite useful    after all there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds of evidence we present  its too bad you feel it necessary to close your mind and eyes to knowledge you live a poorer life as a result of that choice  heck id wager that you could predict a ws winner with greater accuracy than jeanne dixon  and you know why  because i have full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level     you dont have to be rude  have you tried calling a kettle black  for you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy  ignoratio elenchi  i am not saying that morris is better than clemens   because he   has  more   rings   although  i  have  tongue in cheek claimed that in the past  i am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individuals  performance   from that of his teams for the purpose of comparing that individuals performance with another individuals per formance  in other words in your world you cannot objectively state that jack morris was more important to the blue jays than al leiter last year  in your world that may indeed be true  fortunately in the world the rest of us occupy its not  i hope you never serve on a jury roger  i think the rest of the jury would have to kill you  theres no way i can objectively judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty  you see there are 0 billion other people on this planet  we have no way of knowing whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it wasnt for all the other people on the planet  we have no way of knowing how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet because living on this planet is a team effort  and no individual committs a crime totally isolated from his society he is a part of that society  that being case anything i have to say on his culpability would be absolute subjectivity so i refuse to vote  greg

   as to whether it does him any good to have bonds behind him the  netstatmavens will probably tell you theres no reason that it should but if he thinks it will it might be a selffulfilling prophecy  i dont understand  if it is williams lack of ability which you say above and i agree with which causes him to swing at bad pitches how will thinking that bonds hitting behind him will help him to stop chasing bad pitches  i didnt mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that specific deficiency  i meant that if having bonds bat behind him gives williams possibly unfounded confidence that might translate into more hitting productivity  but youre right  if williams biggest problem is more physical than mental thats less likely to make a difference     michael zimmers                                      voice  000 000 0000   softhelp  suppliers to software developers         data   000 000 0000

  i didnt say that pitchers fear of throwing strikes to guys like mcgwire bonds and frank thomas was rational   i just said that it exists  but why mcgwire and not carter  i can see some justification for bonds or thomas because they tend to have higher batting averages but the major difference i see between mcgwire and carter is that carter doesnt draw walks  why arent pitchers afraid to throw strikes to carter  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

  in mssc0qh0yl0pnetcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer writes  if this is true note that i dont think it is lasorda should be fired for at least two reasons           0 publicly humiliating his players          0 knuckling under to his players wishes  there is a fine line between getting players input and knuckling under to players demands  a manager much like a military officer needs to have his her players complete obedience and respect during a game  after the game its no big deal but when there is no time  to do more than react players must trust the manager or the team often falls apart see boston red sox ff      strawberrys demeanor as represented by the media often sounds like demands  i suspect that a comment like i enjoy hitting fourth im used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if it came from strawberry  russ porter quoted strawberry as saying i feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and i think i perform best in that role  paraphrased by my memory and bias  that seems like a fairly nonpetulant answer to what was almost certainly a question  like how do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order a more mediasensitive player might answer the manager knows what he is doing  if he thinks that batting me third will help the team then i am all for it  wed ignore that answer as brown stuff so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand darryls response as petulant  personally i think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesnt matter much in which order the 00 players in the order are batted except for personal stats  if i were darryl id probably answer that question the number four spot gets a few more rbi opportunities and i get paid for rbis  i think it is best for me to bat fourth but i am willing to hit third if tommy thinks it will benefit the team  or something like that  it would be helpful at salary timemy rbis were down because i was hitting thirdand make him sound like a team player  since strawberry will not likely go through arbitration but use the free agent market for his next contract maybe that argument is useless but it would help    his image with the media without appearing to be totally contentfree  remember the media is of the belief that ones best rbi man should hit fourth so the argument is sensible regardless of whether or not it is true jeff

  id have to say the most impressive hrs ive ever see came from dave kingman and his infamous moonraker drives  i remember one he hit circa 0000 at wrigley field that went across the street in dead center field and hit a house on the roof  he whiffed a lot but when he did connect watch out        include stddisclaimerh  dan s  
    polish and jewish are not mutually exclusive   i didnt mean to offend or anything im just quoting stanky himself on the subject i remember one time last year he was being interviewed by espn and the interviewer cant remember who asked stanky if he was jewish because he the interviewer was jewish and wanted to see more jewish ballplayers to which stanky replied im polish not jewish  so maybe that wasnt the most pc thing for stanky to say and maybe i was a little naive when i posted it i think we should just devote this subject to finding actual jewish ballplayers i myself am jewish and the only ones i ever knew until now were koufax greenberg and blomberg  alan  
  jrogoffscottskidmoreedu jay rogoff writes  one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasnt yet been addressed  i believe the rule also does not deal with this situation  however if the infield fly is not caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base wo fear of being doubled off for advancing too early    the runner can leave his base at any time  if the ball is caught hes got to tag up  if it isnt caught he doesnt have to tag up at all  so if hes feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up  if it isnt caught hes probably scored a run  if it is hes probably headed for aaa    the only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out thereby removing the force on the runners on base  all other rules apply as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up    tim shippert                                 shippertccocaltechedu if we are going to stick to this damned quantumjumping then i regret that i ever had anything to do with quantum theory e schrodinger

       the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to  death but i havent seen anything in rsb yet    gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two  on and his club down by a run  he stroked a line drive into the  right field corner  the ball cleared the threefoot high fence and  went into the crowd  darryl racing over from right center got to  the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he  missed the ball  a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt  reached up and caught the ball  home run    now ive seen the replay several times and i have concluded that  darryl missed the ball and that the fans glove was essentially  behind darryls  several dodger fans with seats in the immediate  vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with  strawberry  what cannot be disputed however is that the fan  who caught the ball never took his eye off it  he was oblivious  to where the fielder was playing  he was also quite exuberant as  soon as he realized he had made the catch    stuff about daryl and tommy and everyone blaming fan for the loss deleted  i saw the replay several times too  no question about it  daryl missed the ball then the fan caught it  daryl is so tall that he had the first shot at the ball  daryls just whining again  i think it shows a lack of class when tommy daryl and the dodgers blame a single fan for losing the game  what about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball what about the pitchers that gave up 0 runs up to that point  sorry tommy if it were a 00 game and daryl was 0 feet 0 inches tall then maybe  just maybe  youd have an argument  
  ive been following the giants closely over the offseason  newspapers notesgroup etc  but i had my first up close and personal last night at the stick  after watching giants hitters struggle last year barrys swing was  very impressive  hes very quick and his swing seems effortless even compared to clark particularly clark as of late  it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well  im not sure if barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits 0b 0b hr for 0 rbis  the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to bonds  there has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better  claytons defense has been superb mcgee seems to like leading off this year  manwaring is driving the ball so on  so forth  i hope it continuesi think they need to continue well into june before people are really sold that they are for realparticularly the pitching  for myself i think the fresh start of magowanbakeretc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year  joe loos looscuphpcom  
   buck showalter just cant win   bob wickmans pitching the game of his life through eight innings yanks lead 00 so buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete game wickman manages to get two outs but in between four funs score and all of a sudden its 00 and wickman just cant get the third out so buck goes to the bullpen and farr gets out the first guy he faces  last night jimmy key is pitching another in a long string of games of his life this guy just keeps getting better through eight innings yanks lead 00 this time buck thinks i dont want a repeat of that nearfiasco with wickman so ill give my bullpen some work steve howe whose era was 0000 coming into the game left with it at 0000 he didnt do too good then farr comes in he gives up a tworun homer and the royals win it 00  whats going on this is already the third or fourth time this year that the bullpen has blown a lead farr  howe have done it twice together monteleones done it once and i think even habyan did it once whats the deal we finally have terrific starting pitching so all of a sudden our bullpen turns to shit  whats buck gonna do and whats george gonna do if this continues to happen  alan

  jrogoffscottskidmoreedu jay rogoff writes  one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasnt yet been addressed  i believe the rule also does not deal with this situation  if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught runners can tag up and advance at their own risk as on any fly ball  however if the infield fly is not caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base wo fear of being doubled off for advancing too early  when the ball hits the ground  when a fielder first touches the ball after it hits the ground  enlightenment would be appreciated  im not sure i understand this question when the if rule is invoked the batter is automatically out this relieves the runners from being forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught other than that isnt it just the same as any situation in which a runner on a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball that is if the ball is caught he can tag up and run or decide to stay and if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time   eric smith ericsnetcomcom ericsinfoservcom ci 000000000

   ive been a giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained about the old ballyard place sure its been cold the food lines were long and the hired hands were surly but this was all part of the giants mystique or so i thought  i went to tuesdays game 0  0 giants over the marlins and the stick was  a much different place nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind but  everything is a lot better the lines are a lot shorter the bathrooms are clean and have running water and the hired hands were very polite   the new foghorn lights up and blows after each homerun and the wooden fence are very nice as are the new bleachers the bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view and theyve got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers the only complaint is that the electronic  oldfashioned scoreboard looks electronic  could be better  these things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real  businessman ex  safeway president peter magowan to figure it out just  like he used to tell his checkers if the customers dont come back i dont need as many checkers this isnt a knock on bob lurie  he was a competent businessman but he didnt deal much with the general public  ill give an example of how the level of service has changed the onion  dispenser jammed as i was using it an attendant came over apoligized for the problem and proceeded to fix the machine after he was done he cleaned the machine and said he was glad to be able to help in the old days there was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say go to the stand 000 feet away  they might be able to help  all in all it was a fun day    craig eid  email address    craigehpsadsadhpcom

    i agree though id also be happy with a stadium that looks  like new comiskey the new park was also made for baseball  unlike three rivers the vet riverfront etc its not a  football park in which they also play baseball  while were on the multipurpose subject lets not forget shea which was designed to accommodate both the mets  jets  it was the first stadium i think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football  not the first  rfk olim dc stadium was built 0 years earlier nowadays they dont move the seats back for the few exhibition games but the 0rdbaself lower deck used to move  it was all  metal which was pretty noisy on bat day  of course with the jets gone to jersey and a truly good football stadium the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where because its circular the seats are almost always too far from the action  the mets announcerskiner  murphy in particularhave always hyped it as beautiful shea stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is  its vastly better than it was before they fixed it though  back in the late 00s it was a dump  roger dont youlike jet noise    
       hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves it i  mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it as  is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance or darrell  evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie  murray and jeff reardon  um what  eddie murray was a superb first baseman for a long time  winfield as produced consistently for almsot 00 years and excellently on several occasions    dave kingmans best year was like darryl strawberrys typical year with the mets    darrell evans too did a whole lot more than just hit homers which  is all that kong did         well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving  hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards marginal  whom are you talking about  yes eddie murray is marginal but thats because hes 00 years old  he wasnt marginal for a long time  honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there theyre both  shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal  not    smith has hung around for a long time and fielded the position better  than anyone else ever has  yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago in case you hadnt  noticed  one of his two mvp awards was as a centerfielder       lets be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so  liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if  like whom  there are many players in the hall who arent anywhere near as goos as the guys youre running down  something isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when  thats already the case by some standards  but the bad players in the  hall are all from the 00s and 00s  recent picks have generally been excellent  certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan  no but who cares  was stan musial anywhere near as good as babe ruth not really  but he obviously belongs there  the hall has generally had about the top 0 of major leaguers  as  more players come through the game more will be in that top 0    and yes its pretty easy to argue that smith yount evans winfield etc are in the top 0  dave kingman on the other hand was a liability throughout most of his career  of course garvey hasnt gotten a lot of hof press so i dont know what you mean    as for ryan is his wl better than morris  thats what a lot of voters tend to look at  and morris was awfully good for a decade and doesnt lead mlb history in walks allowed either  roger

  sorry i gotta disagree here  last time i played ball i went up on several occasions intending to hit a fly ball deep enough to score the runner from third or advance a runner to third  its relatively easy actually you swing under the path of the ball you normally would to hit a good line drive  with fastballs its very easy much more difficult with good breaking balls  a good hitter with excellent bat control can voluntarily hit fly balls to the outfield at least oh 00 of the time  maybe more  theres a blurb in the stats scoreboard about this and though i dont have the book with me here my memory is that the best at hitting sac flies were far below this 00 number  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom  
   in article 00000astsaiccom sacasdisaiccom steve a conroy x0000 writes   major league baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter  attention spans ie the football crowd   invariably all the  arguments from people who dont like to watch baseball on tv say the  same thing  the games are too long and too boring  baseball is trying  to find a way to shorten the games for wider tv appeal  if you look at  it though baseball games last around the same amount of time as football  games  the difference is that there is more action in that duration in  football games  perhaps if there were more action in baseball games you  would get more of those fans to tune in  anyway coming up with a solution  to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult  on soapbox yet another reason to get a commisioner now since its obvious  that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in  nebraska off soapbox    how can you say there is more action in football then baseball a football  game consists of approximately 000 plays and the average duration of a play  is around 0 seconds this means that in a game that lasts approximately 0  hours you have about 00 minute s of action in a baseball game you have  upwards of two hundred pitches there are very few on field strategy   on field stratgy sessions ie huddles and you always have a chance to win  until the last out is made       ah but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and a sense of urgency because of the game clock not all the time but it happens when theres less than 0 minutes to go quite often  this sense creates drama even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewers attention  in baseball only 0 players are involved in the action for about here comes a wild guess 00 of the time  and theyre just playing a sophisticated game of catchholdtheballstepoutoftheboxadjustchains touchselfininterestinglocations  theres a lot of dead time with the players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher who then takes 0 00 pitches or helen dell playing the organ dodger fans will appreciate that one  to the non baseball junkie this is boring at any rate im not putting baseball down for this  ive been an avid fan since i can remember  its just that watching a baseball game on tv at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie  thats what major league baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of shortening the game  its because of tv not because football has more action than baseball    steve conroy conroyterminussaiccom  im gone man  solid gone   science applicationsbaloo international corporation

   some folks like to argue about theoretical details i prefer to watch teams win when the giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange the batting order until then i think its stupid to focus on whats wrong for the simple fact that its working as it is  this is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division but the giants are going to need every break they can get if they want too hold that lead  i dont think they can afford to be lackadaisical and say well it has worked pretty well so far and while we might be able to improve the results we dont think it is worth the risk  mostly though the giants are winning and frankly as long as that continues its rather silly to secondguess their strategy but evidently some folks would rather be right than be first  the two tend to go hand in hand  cheers valentine

    in article c0vhlhidzusenetucsindianaedu rstimetssilverucsindianaedu robert and stimets writes   in a game that saw a little of everythingincredible defense some power clutch pitching and a little wildnessthe reds managed to overcome their trademark lack of timely hitting in crucial situations   during spring training i made a similarly innoncentlooking comment   about clutch hitting on this bb and the flames were flying  no such  thing as clutch hitting they the sdcns all screamed  i assumed  they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance  given their comments    this is certainly not the case  there is no significant ability toi perform in the clutch but clutch performance certainly happens every time there is a gamewinning hit  the clutch pitching quoted above is something which happened not a claim that any particular player should be expected to be a clutch pitcher   over the past four seasons sabo has had 00 hits in 000 abs defined as  clutch situations by the scouting report for an average of 000  over that same period he had another 0000 abs with 000 hits for an  average of 000   according to the rest of the sdcns any differential such as this is  completely and totally random and cannot be used for any reasonable  inference such as perhaps perez should have used a pinch hitter in  that situation  simple statistics tell me that there is a 0 chance an average clutch hitter would have this large a split the average decrease is 0 points standard deviation about 00  there will be such hitters in any league just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on tuesdays  and there is only a very weak correlation 00 in my best study between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability  based only on this data i dont see any reason to pinchhit for sabo or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past  but there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinchhit does the pinchhitter give you a platoon advantage  any portion of sabos clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a real ability even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting  do you have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run  do you have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves   david grabiner grabinerzariskiharvardedu we are sorry but the number you have dialed is imaginary please rotate your phone 00 degrees and try again disclaimer i speak for no one and no one speaks for me  
    ideally dhs should be the strongest offensive players because  any schmoe can play dh if he can hit  that would take care of position  corrected anomolies such as franks  since that is not the case and why  not  is it always this way then we are going to have trouble finding the  true value of dhs using the same models as that for position players  there are several reasons for this difference  the main reason is that good hitters in their prime such as frank thomas and danny tartabull are rarely regular dhs even if they cant field its more commonly a place to put aging veterans  another use of the dh slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field  i would expect such players to hit worse as dhs than they did during the rest of the season  a third factor is that most player who split time between dh and first or the outfield dont hit as well as dhs for some reason  reggie jackson was a good example in five years as a rfdh for the angels he hit like the old reggie when he was in right  the second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only a player who plays 00 games in right and 00 at dh will count only in the right fielders averages   a logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement  value if you can find it for 0b or lf or something  we can assume that  if forced to play defense they would play at true zero value even though i  doubt this is actually true for players like winfield and molitor  this  would let us discount the time they spend playing dh because that  forces the team to find another real fielder to play  this makes sense you might also look at it another way  although the average offensive performance of a dh may be lower than for a left fielder the replacementlevel offensive performance is certainly lower if you are a left fielder but cant hit well enough to keep a job anywhere then you certainly cant hit well enough to keep a job at dh    david grabiner grabinerzariskiharvardedu we are sorry but the number you have dialed is imaginary please rotate your phone 00 degrees and try again disclaimer i speak for no one and no one speaks for me  
  in article mssc0xb0i0cgnetcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer writes  sigh  here we go again                       actually several scdns stated that there were no definable skills that would make a hitter more likely to perform better in clutch situations vs nonclutch situations however one might choose to define clutch  right  can you define such a skill  must i  if i were to say that batting average is a predictor that  can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a hit on a particular plate appearance is that only valid if i can define the skill in hitting a baseball  thats all ive said  except i used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations  and elsewhere on this thread sherri nichols repeats her position that batting average in clutch situations is a meaningless statistic  for predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless  at least if it has meaning we dont know how to find it  i did not say i could predict the future  ive suggested that the statistic is not necessarily meaningless  heres the data for this situation  nonclutchclutch  abhbaabhba  sabo000000000000000000 samuel000000000000000000   if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel  im sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance  you just wouldnt have used this particular aspect of prior performance  is this not correct   ill try to avoid being insulting  but its difficult when you so cavalierly dismiss hundreds of hours of work with an i dont pretend to understand but  nobody is denying that there are people who have hit well in the clutch in the past  but i challenge you to find a method to predict who will hit well in the clutch in the future  which after all is what you are claiming you can do  since   one more time  i did not claim to be able to predict the future i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo  and i am not dismissing your work  im stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work   fine  we have plenty of data  obviously our preconceived biases must be coloring our work since you know clutch hitting is a welldefined and consistent skill all of our failures notwithstanding  so i challenge you to prove it  i guarantee you that if you can prove the existance of some form of clutch ability you will have plenty of happy sdcns dancing around you  i did not say that clutchhitting is well defined  i said that the data is significant  to me  i did not say that it is a consistent skill  i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances   but you arent going to win any support by merely stating a position and claiming they are stupid so i must be right   and big sigh   i have not not  not   not    not     not      not ever called you or anyone else on rsb stupid   it is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases   yeah  hindsight is always 0000  doesnt that make you bright  this is a stupid argument and you know it  ah  i knew we could get to the name calling  and theres that word you like so much   a suggestion  take data from 00000000 and attempt to come up with some method that predicts who hit well in the clutch in 0000  if that works we can then attempt to apply it to 0000 and beyond  wait a minute  i thought i first had to define clutch hitting do i or dont i  you have made strong statements  now back them up or be proven a total idiot  i made two statements in my post  0i am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting  0i would have hit for sabo   as for 0 many of us make a number of written statements through  this media about what we think will happen in baseball  im not shy about it  ill make the statement again  i believe that by seasons end that chris sabos batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch situations  i cant prove that it will happen so i guess well  just have to wait and see                                      heres another one for you  in 0000  0000 joe carters batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in nonclutch situations each year  i presume you think this is random    nonclutch0000 ab000 h000 clutch 000 ab 00 h000  so what could we expect in 0000 from mr carter  well his composite ba through 0000 was 000  through 0000 was 000  through 0000 was 000 so i think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of batting average he can produce  in 0000 he hit 000  not surprising huh  also in 0000   nonclutch 000 ab000 h000 clutch  00 ab 00 h000  no this doesnt prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of  major league ballplayers  it just makes me think that in 0000 joe carters batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in nonclutch situations                                     as for 0 above i have plenty of company  john dewan of statsinc is the editor of the scouting report wherein the statistics regarding clutch hitting are compiled reported and referenced in the text bill james makes numerous references to a players ability to hit well in the clutch  i am not saying that i can predict the future any more than they are   you and others are saying that your work renders their statements and mine meaningless  i dont  accept that which in your words proves that i am a total idiot   stupid  total idiot    my my  such hostility    the beastmaster    mark singer     mssnetcomcom  
  like clinton and reno i accept full responsibility for this senseless disaster  my wife and i picked this game to go to and thus caused the return of the preseasonprojected sox offense  like all nonos bosio was good lucky hard grounder by vaughn off t martinez glove but straight to boone who  threw to bosio at first 000 and backed by good defense many nontrivial groundouts  the game was amazingly fast as the sox tended to go down quickly and hesketh was also  working fast  the sox relief pitching was ok  the runs off quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single which greenwell let get past him trying for a catch  greenwells mental stability is a serious concern i guess it has always been but his quirks were amusing back when he was an mvp candidate  wednesday he got in a huff with johnson a after striking out on a bad inside pitch apparently johnson made an ok ive got to stay focused gesture which iron mike interpreted as taunting and struck out to heavy booing the  next two times  as valentine noted last night he came up in the first after riles and quintana had walked to open the game can you say take the first pitch  not mike who dribbled it into a 000  the pi quoted bosio that this was a batting practice fastball  next time up he also hit the first pitch a hard liner straight to kgjr in center  he also made the pathetic error and failed to catch boones hr which looked  comparable to the ball lance johnson caught on the highlight reel that night  is riles suppsoed to be good defensively  i couldnt tell from the field angle but his range looked bad and he coughed a dp that cost a run or two  why was he leadoff  i hope fletcher gets well soon  also on lineups pinella put bret boone fifth for reasons beyond me  it seemed to work as he was 00 with a hr and some good defense a wag behind us said he sure dont want to go back to calgary  there is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth because theyll likely lead off the second as boone did  well now we face the hot angels and another power pitcher in langston  a reminder that contest entries are open through next wednesday  i expect a surge of pessimism  by the way ties will be broken by earliest entry  one entry per person or pseudonym please and easy on the pseudonyms  dave mb

    can anyone out there tell me why they call lefthanded pitchers  i dont know about the story but it comes from the fact that in most stadiums the batter faces northeast and so when a pitcher is on the mound his left arm is to the south hence the term  southpaw  also the story on how the term originated  thanks    go cubs   prediction they will finish over 000 this year without winning the east

  i watched the final inning of bosios nohitter with several people at work after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he wouldnt have had time to throw riles out yet the throw beat riles by about two steps i wonder how many others who watched the final out think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand does anybody think vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded and if he failed to field it cleanly would it or should it have been an error or a hit judging from bosios grimace when the ball bounced past him he must have thought it would go through for a hit whether vizquel was right or wrong he certainly made one hell of a play      phil brown                 aka pb0000cscalbanyedu    
   but it is subject to all kinds of bias and is almost completely   useless  for first basemen  from the raw stats there is no way to tell   which of  a first basemans putouts were made on throws from other fielders   and  which were made on his own plays likewise you cant tell whether   a  double play was 000 or 000  fielding runs thus gives a first  baseman no credit for putouts or double plays only for assists and  errors    but ingnoring putouts is biased in yet another way range is not the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman the ability to field all sorts of balls thrown to him digging some out of the dirt stretching for others and so forth is important thus  putouts do provide some information  maybe what we need is a comparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the first baseman vs how many he actually got    jim mann             stratus computer   jmannvinelandpubsstratuscom

   oh yea and chris bosio pitched a nohitter  one over the minimum two bases on ball in the first inning one runner left 00 pitches  i listened to the game on radio and listening to dave niehaus call the game was a real treat as long as they keep ron fairly quite i doubt if anyone is better than niehaus  but that fairly guy is really annoying me  but i guess if clemens or viola had been pitching it would have  been a different story   two shutouts in two nights against the hottest best hitting team in major league baseball   pretty impressive in any league  man if johnson bosio and hanson keep going the mariners could be a  really interesting team to follow this year  also john cummings rookie has had three solid outings with no support  if fleming comes back  this may be the best starting staff in the american league this year relief is another story though  grimace  too cool  the first nohitter that i have been able to follow from  start to end  and again i think niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game  the guy is truly a joy to listen to  he deserves a pennant race   kent dietz twins in 00 mariners  if only they were an nl team  follow

     ive been a braves fan for as long as ive been watching baseball almost 00 years now  i say that just tp preface what im about to post  this braves team is made up of slow starters  people are amazed that the braves arent hitting  dont be  they werent hitting last year at this time nor were they the year before  they had slow aprils and mays in the 0000 and 0000 seasons  and yet they still managed to go to the series in those years  well this team is no different so why should we be suprised at their slow start  they started that way for the past two years and theyll be that way until the richmond club makes it to the majors  judge their offense in june or july when things start to average out  im just happy that the reds have gotten off to such a poor start  the giants always do well in the early part of the season but theyll be out of the race by july just like the last few years  unless bonds developes a knuckelball their staff will get rocked by midjune    wow you really know how to hurt a guy guess i shouldnt bother watching any more games its already been decided   luigi   randy palermo   luigicsdsgicom    fax 0000000000 silicon graphics computer systems 0000 n shoreline blvd mt view ca 00000 play an accordion go to jail thats the law  
  in article mssc0xb0i0cgnetcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer writes   i dont pretend to understand statistical analysis  well we agree on the last part   cool  and thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly namecalling of others      one of the basic things you need to  have in a statistic to be able to predict a players performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year  a  players batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year  ok  the basic problems with something like clutch batting average  overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero  adding to the sample size doesnt seem to help much  actually i think the largescale sample size is part of the problem it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to ba vs clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of bell curve  the xaxis being the  deviation in clutch hitting vs nonclutch  the yaxis being the number of players  certainly there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell  my supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players    as a counterexample to  what you showed consider the following two players from 00000000                 nonclutch                      clutch                ab      h       ba              ab      h       ba   maldonado      0000    000     000            000     00      000 lemon          0000    000     000            000     00      000  if you had had these two players in 0000 by your logic in those clutch situations youd bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye  well in  0000 maldonado hit 000 in nonclutch and 000 in clutch while lemon hit 000 in nonclutch and 000 in clutch  before you accuse me of  completely cooking the data  you wont hear those kind of accusations from me  it is interesting that you selected maldonado because he is someone whom i have also  looked at  he has been a very inconsistent hitter in terms of ba hitting in 0000  00  000 000 000 000    admittedly he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs  his clutch hitting  record is equally inconsistent  so for my purposes in 0000 i would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance  i dont know how i would have felt in 0000 but you may indeed be right    when i looked at sabo i found a more consistent record of hitting and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his nonclutch ba  ditto for joe carter  this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having with others on this topic  must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity  is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base   btw correlating players overall batting average from 0000 with 00 gives a correlation coefficient of 000 which is significant at something better than the 000 confidence level  correlating their clutchnonclutch ba for the same period gives a correlation of  0000 significant at no level of any interest  i completely accept that reasoning  again what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis   actually its technically incorrect to say that we cant predict future clutch performance  its more correct to say that we cant predict future clutch performance with any skill  amen    the beastmaster     mark singer     mssnetcomcom

  in article 0000apr0000000000000cscornelledu tedwardcscornelledu edward ted fischer writes  sigh  here we go again                       you started it  for predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless  at least if it has meaning we dont know how to find it  i did not say i could predict the future  you most certainly did  nonclutchclutch  abhbaabhba sabo000000000000000000 samuel000000000000000000  sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel  yet you would pinchhit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter  right  id call that predicting the future  if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel  im sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance  you just wouldnt have used this particular aspect of prior performance  is this not correct  right  i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past  overall performance lr splits even matching hittingpitching styles  all of these will give me some advantage if used properly  even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance  and in this case everything else pointed to sabo  one more time  i did not claim to be able to predict the future i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo  that comes down to the same thing  when perez left sabo in he was predicting the future the next ab  he was predicting that sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel  by supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite  and i am not dismissing your work  im stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work  well yes  you are aware of its existance  you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling  yet you rather forcefully state the opposite  you dont seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important id say this is insulting  i did not say that it is a consistent skill  i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances  right  this is the beef  it has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under any circumstances  at least none that weve been able to come up with  if you know of some where it is an indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret  it is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases  most certainly  as i have repeatedly stated if you can come up with a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability i would love it  however the straightforward attempts at such a study have all failed miserably  yeah  hindsight is always 0000  doesnt that make you bright  this is a stupid argument and you know it  ah  i knew we could get to the name calling  and theres that word you like so much  well it was a stupid argument  are you honestly debating that sure we know sabo didnt get a hit  we have no idea whether samuel would have done any better or not  one ab most certainly doesnt prove anything  i believe that by seasons end that chris sabos batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch situations  i cant prove that it will happen so i guess well  just have to wait and see  is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year  or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall  if you mean the first then as you say well just have to wait and see  but the second is a much stronger statement  in fact it suggests a rule  we can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years  i think you will agree that if the rule didnt work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do any better this year  right  heres another one for you  in 0000  0000 joe carters batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in nonclutch situations each year  i presume you think this is random    im not going to get into case analysis  sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit poorly in 00 as well  you can also find those who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit well in 00  no this doesnt prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of  major league ballplayers  it just makes me think that in 0000 joe carters batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in nonclutch situations  gamblers fallacy  unless there is reason to expect consistency a run proves nothing  can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next  ive seen a detailed study of why i shouldnt expect it to correlate  stupid  total idiot    my my  such hostility  the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid  and i dont see how you can deny it  as for total idiot  yes  if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely  so tell me  does the term fit  or do you have an open mind  valentine

  stuff deleted mattingly scores badly on both counts he doesnt get to very many balls and he lets a lot of balls go through the fact that he looks smooth has great hands and makes few errors means nothing this is traditional brainless reliance on observations that can easily be misled like a lot of bad fielders mattingly actually makes himself look better by not having any range hes nowhere near as bad as steve garvey but thats not much of a compliment   i agree with the flavor of this post but disagree with one specific argument  that has great hands means nothing  it seems to me that a firstbasemans defensive value is not entirely or even primarily from his ability to field grounders or catch popups  how many such chances does he get during a game  many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 0bss0b and p i mean the total of these is much higher than grounderpopup totals  this implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well even if they are high uptheline or in the dirt  good hands are needed for such plays and thus have value  i dont have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays but id guess that the values of these abilities are similar  its just like you dont judge catchers defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups but not as marked i suppose  michael

  to all the braves doubters  dont worry  the bats will come alive and the braves will come around the pitching is solid and as long the braves dont have serious injuries to the starting rotation theyll continue to pitch well  heck with the five starters on the braves rotation they could even sustain an injury to one of the five i hope this doesnt happen though  the bats are there pendleton will certainly bat over 000 justice is catching fire bream nixon sanders gant well theres too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer  right now the cleveland indians have 0 players batting over 000  but i certainly wouldnt their seven for our respective seven though wouldnt the braves be something right now with their pitching and 0 players batting over 000  the bullpen well it is suspect  but when the bats come alive the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern  so anyway i believe the braves will be tough to beat this season  im not saying the braves have automatically won the division but im optim istic about their season though its awful painful to watch them at times right now  go braves  dean

   actually i think the largescale sample size is part of the problem it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to ba vs clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of bell curve  the xaxis being the  deviation in clutch hitting vs nonclutch  the yaxis being the number of players  certainly there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell  right  most definitely  my supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players  this may be the root of the confusion  please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind  note that i am not yet saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand  suppose we have a simplified lotto game  you pick a number from 000 and win if that number is drawn  suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week  in the first year of the game approximately 00 of the population will win 0 or more times  in the second year of the game 00 of those 0time winners will again be 0time winners  in the third year of the game 00 of those who won 0 or more times in each of the first two years will win 0 again  suppose i started with 0000 people in my population  after three years i have 00 people who have consistently in each of the last three years won 000 or more the number of times expected  do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game no  because we know there is no skill involved  nothing about these consistent winners can influence their chances of winning  but suppose we dont know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved  perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic or something  how would we test this hypothesis  we can look for correlations in the population  now most of the population will show zero correlation  but our psychics should show a high positive correlation even if they arent very good psychics they should still manage to win 0 or more times most years  net result  a small positive correlation over the entire population  this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having with others on this topic  must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity  is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base  well zero correlation is zero correlation  you mention that sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last 0 years  but if we look at the past we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent  the length of the streak doesnt seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year  is there any reason to expect this streak to be different from past streaks  now if it were true that 00 of all threeyear streaks remained true to form then we might have something useful  but then we wouldnt have zero correlation  instead we have 00 of all threeyear streaks remain true to form and 00 of all threeyear streaks reverse  you look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year  but it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year since the probabilities are split 0000 each way  i completely accept that reasoning  again what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis   then we would have something useful  and we would also have a positive correlation  but for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses  cheers valentine  
  note  im not posting this as part of an argument with roger meynard but as an independent sort of thread  i do actually quote some things that roger meynard wrote but it might be better to think of this as sampling his post in the hiphop sense because it fits in with what i want to say  maynardramseycslaurentianca roger maynard writes but the point is that the only decision making pro cess  used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re lates to the teams  not the individual players  there is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances  and that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game  theres an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some peoples conception of a biological organism  in the biology context we would very likely read fitness for the score of the game and organisms for teams  how we interpret players is trickier but either organs or genes might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make  a genes interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case  but that would be a different and probably longer post  if however we take the organ view then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like species x is more fit than species y because of a better organ z  given what we know about the interdependence of organs we would often be suspicious of such claims  but note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map species x onto humans and organ z onto brain  on the other hand some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others as far as we can test them eg brain above might be more reasonable than pancreas assuming no gross pathology particularly if species y is a primate  even when you make such statements you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species  however if we are nonvitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable whole but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable  some of these processes might be localized to particular organs while others may be distributed across multiple organs  in a way this is just like a baseball team except that i think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are much simpler and less numerous than in most organisms  to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab solutely  that  player as team would have played better with player b in their lineup  sheer speculation  impossible to ascertain  one thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do  but of course this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty  most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research  if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has done better than another pitcher with those statistics as a criteria then fine  in this cases were seeing the word statistics means summary of observed events where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process and possibly inputs for other processes thus if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses  but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individuals contribution to winning the ws  because that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of baseball  this statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment you might be fit in one situation and not another  moving to baseball it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league  in at least a nominal sense the division winners are the fittest teams in the league in that they on average had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts  but in a real sense there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to or interesting for baseball  the same is true in biology  but here is also no direct biological equivalent of the world series in basebal  in the world series the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful  it might be fun to watch but its unclear what it all really means    now just one more unrelated point  i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon  on the other hand you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes and maybe some of us eg me who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis but this is probably only due to the fact that a 000game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops arent the only difference between the winners and the losers  moreover youve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the world series situation that makes the strong claim that nobody can predict the ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the wellknown home vs road effect on winning percentage  the stats are a nice hobby and thats about it  there is no new knowledge being produced    since stats are summaries of events its true that if you know the events you can derive the stats  but if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats then the stats produce new knowledge and some of this might even be reliable repeatable and useful  speaking of which i should get back to producing knowledge in a

     the subject line says it all what is the rule that qualifies  a pitcher as making a save  imho this is the most untrustworthy silly stat by todays rules in all  of baseball  my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot  pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least  appear in the ondeck circle  also the lead a pitcher enters with cannot  excede three runs  i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in  determining winnerssaversetc  for instance a pitcher can come in in the  ninth with a lead blow the lead fall behind have his team come back in  the next half inning and earn the win  has this pitcher earned a win no  way  i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his  teammates rally to tie the score  assume he came in to start the fourth  and left after the eighth  his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in  the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win  the  third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat  satisfaction  mike  i bleed the blue of dodgers and even like lasorda spaghetti sauce

   mark singer brings up the strawberry incident where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it   before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech  wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that  are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any   that are in the field of play  was the fan wrong  should he have  been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility  of interference   yes i think he should have done more to get out of the way  as much as fans want to catch a ball they really should be aware that winning the game is more important  as a dodger fan he has to be aware that this is the home stadium and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible  as soon as the ball was hit that far his first instinct should be to root for darryl to catch it not to try to catch it himself particularly when he is sitting that close  i enjoy the attitude of the wrigley fans where they are against  visiting team home runs so much they actually throw them back on the field  now this has nothing to do with whether darryl could have caught it or not  sure he probably screwed up but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win   daniel danielcalderauscedu

  ive been following the giants closely over the offseason  newspapers notesgroup etc  but i had my first up close and personal last night at the stick  after watching giants hitters struggle last year barrys swing was  very impressive  hes very quick and his swing seems effortless even compared to clark particularly clark as of late  it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well  im not sure if barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits 0b 0b hr for 0 rbis       the giants always hit maddux well but it was interesting that maddux did not pitch around bonds to get to clayton last night  he threw 0 straight fastballs over the plate to bonds in the 0st last night got away with the first one but bonds hit the second one out of the park  then in the 0rd when clark was at third base with one out maddux did not intentionally walk bonds and bonds dropped a single to leftcenter   the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to bonds  there has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better  claytons defense has been superb mcgee seems to like leading off this year  manwaring is driving the ball so on  so forth       the braves announcers pointed out that mcgee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet  he will always hit around 000 but im concerning about his onbase percentage  the key in the lineup is matt williams he has to stay hot so that bonds can hit with runners on base   i hope it continuesi think they need to continue well into june before people are really sold that they are for realparticularly the pitching       the pitching gets a set back as bud black is placed on the dl  burba has done a superb job filling in so far he looks like a different pitcher from last year  however swift is terrible in both of his starts  with burba moving into the rotation mike jackson is the only righthanded reliever aside from rod beck hell get a lot of actions  i also hope that dusty can manage his bullpen better than roger craig especially on beck i was concerned when beck was used for 0 straight days earlier this week   for myself i think the fresh start of magowanbakeretc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year       so far so good   edward hui

  i dont actually have the answer to this one  bosio after walking the first two batters retired 00straight for a backend perfect game  how many other games  including extra inning games  have seen a pitcher retire 00 straight excluding official perfect games  the only other instance of this i know about for sure is the famous ernie shore game which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in cooperstown shore came into the game when boston pitcher babe ruth got thrown out for arguing over the firstbatter walk shore picked him off and retired 00 straight after that  matt wall  wallccswarthmoreedu  hey i gotta job here ok  april 0 0000 boston red sox seize first place  
  just to add to this vein consider that range of a first baseman is not the only important thing  he is imo the best fielder of bad throws from the other infielders  i have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt catch balls off a large bounce take down balls over his head wide etc ad infinitum  and he gets the out much of the time  some of the things he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing  you have to give mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot near the bag yes i am sure he gets a few calls because he is mattingly        keith kellerlets go rangers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs      in this cornerlets go quakers      weighing in at almost every weight imaginable          life and all that surrounds it      blues traveler 0000

  punjabilelandstanfordedu sanjeev punjabi writes  some evidence that is not working  take a look at the standings its real easy to get so focussed on  minutinae and forget that the giants happen to be in first place if its working you dont screw it up by changing things just because you think it ought to be different  so that is the reason why the toronto blue jays should keep alfredo griffin just because it worked  a team winning doesnt mean that everything that its doing is right a team not winning doesnt mean that everything that its doing is wrong or otherwise to borrow the sharks situation you would say that george kingston should be fired  some folks like to argue about theoretical details i prefer to watch teams win when the giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange the batting order until then i think its stupid to focus on whats wrong for the simple fact that its working as it is  by then its too late  the problem with not fixing something while its working is that by then there may not be anything left to fix  mostly though the giants are winning and frankly as long as that continues its rather silly to secondguess their strategy but evidently some folks would rather be right than be first  so the blue jays were simply perfect last year there was nothing that they could have done to have improved that team  not   go california angels  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu

  in article mssc0y00d000netcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer writes quoted for future reference shown to be consistent in the past  overall performance lr splits even matching hittingpitching styles  all of these will give me some advantage if used properly  was predicting the future the next ab  he was predicting that sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel  he believed one of two things 0 sabo was more likely than samuel to get a hit or 0 that more good would be done in the long run by leaving sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome  in fact you dont know what perez had in mind when he left sabo in  by supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite  in fact i dont think anyone is claiming that they can predict the future or any particular future event  but we can believe that certain trends are due to a cause whether or not we have identified the cause and therefore will continue  and i am not dismissing your work  im stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work well yes  you are aware of its existance  you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling  yet you rather forcefully state the opposite  you dont seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important id say this is insulting  i think seeing insults in other peoples opinions is kind of silly after all mark didnt call you a total idiot or call your work stupid he simply stated that it didnt change his opinion on the  subject  i did not say that it is a consistent skill i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances right  this is the beef  it has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under any circumstances  at least none that weve been able to come up with  if you know of some where it is an indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret  if player a hits better on tuesdays and always has and mark believes that it might be an indication that he will hit on tuesday better next season as well would you respond the same way  at some point you might admit that all variable might not be known to you who knows what this guy does every monday night  maybe he sees his sports shrink on tuesday mornings or has his vitamin b shots monday nights  but this is something thats true of one guy only  it doesnt mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire league by days of the week nor that there should be  but it doesnt mean we cant make predictions based on that for that particular player  i believe that by seasons end that chris sabos batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch situations  i cant prove that it will happen so i guess well  just have to wait and see  is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year  or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall  i only see a prediction for one player here  i dont see anything about all batters  heres another one for you  in 0000  0000 joe carters batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in nonclutch situations each year  i presume you think this is random   im not going to get into case analysis  sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit poorly in 00 as well  you can also find those who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit well in 00  thats exactly what mark is trying to do though  find hitters that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions for these hitters based on their past performance  major league ballplayers  it just makes me think that in 0000 joe carters batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in nonclutch situations gamblers fallacy  unless there is reason to expect consistency a  huh  what does gamblers fallacy have to do with anything whether you can know the reason for correlation or not you cant deny that it has existent you can only make an argument that you dont think it is likely to continue to exist because you cant see a reason for it to exist  run proves nothing  can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next  ive seen a detailed study of  someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate the argument along the lines of star player with lr splits will always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game ie opposing manager will always bring in a ah pitcher to face him where his manager will not pull him for a ph  i dont see how you can deny it  as for total idiot  yes  if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely so tell me  does the term fit  or do you have an open mind  what about you  if the shoe fits will you wear it with an open mind  rudy

  can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make absolutely no sense  at least in the local gannett rag that finds its way to my door  i must have stared at cleman in the mets box for a good 00 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was  wouldnt it make more sense to use colemn  ive seen it as colmn also  blame the associated press  after the official scorer balances the official score card they copy it and give it to several diffent people  one of those is a person from ap whose job it is to type it up using a template on a laptop and transmit it to the ap offices in new york rockefeller center via the telephone  the box scores are not checked and just rebroadcasted over aps news delivery services  if there are corrections those are issued later  it is the person sitting in front of a laptop at shea or whereever whose fault that is  note the ap puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in most newspapers being the first one  last week they were in denver  maybe the ap person in denver did this remember they just started with mlb out there  check tomorrows paper 000 and see if the person who is doing it from shea does the same thing   scott barman     mets mailing list feed the following into your shell scottasdcom               mail metsrequestasdcom                              subscribe  lets go mets

  while were on the multipurpose subject lets not forget shea which was designed to accommodate both the mets  jets  it was the first stadium i think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football  minor point  shea stadium was designed as a multipurpose stadium but not with the jets in mind as the tennant  the new york football giants had moved to yankee stadium from the polo grounds in 0000 and was having problem with stadium management the city did not own yankee stadium until 0000  the idea was to get the giants to move into shea when a deal was worked out between the giants and the yankees the new afl franchise the new york titans approached the city about using the new stadium  the titans were playing in downing stadium where the cosmos played soccer in the 00s  because shea stadium was tied into the worlds fair anyway the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the worlds fair like they were doing with the mets  so the deal was worked out  of course with the jets gone to jersey and a truly good football stadium the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where because its circular the seats are almost always too far from the action  the mets announcerskiner  murphy in particularhave always hyped it as beautiful shea stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is  im under the impression that when murph says it he means it  as a regular goer to shea it is not a bad place since theyve cleaned and renovated the place  remember this is its 00th year   scott barman     mets mailing list feed the following into your shell scottasdcom               mail metsrequestasdcom                              subscribe  lets go mets

  mikefbvcedu writes in article 0000apr0000000000000newshubarielyorkuca cs000000arielyorkuca geoffrey e dias writes  the subject line says it all what is the rule that qualifies  a pitcher as making a save imho this is the most untrustworthy silly stat by todays rules in all  of baseball  my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot  pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least  appear in the ondeck circle  also the lead a pitcher enters with cannot  excede three runs  this is a phenomenon known around work as readyfireaim i am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only dont understand but publicly admit to not understanding in fact theres a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins  for the record there are two ways that a reliever can get a save he must finish the game and either 0 have entered the game with the tying run on base at bat or on deck 0 have pitched at least three innings effectively a pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game  i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in  determining winnerssaversetc  for instance a pitcher can come in in the  ninth with a lead blow the lead fall behind have his team come back in  the next half inning and earn the win  has this pitcher earned a win no  way  but this is an argument that wins is a dumb stat not saves  i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his  teammates rally to tie the score  assume he came in to start the fourth  and left after the eighth  his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in  the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win  the  third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat  satisfaction  this again doesnt support your claim about saves at the beginning of your post    mike jones  aix highend development  mjonesdonaldaixkingstonibmcom  conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design  frederick p brooks jr the mythical manmonth  
     the subject line says it all what is the rule that qualifies  a pitcher as making a save    as far as i know a save opportunity is when it is 0th inning or beyond and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game for example if it is the bottom of the 0th inning and clemens is pithching the red sox are leading 00 and clemens has just givin up a hit so there is a man on first the batter and the batter on deck could tie the game with a homer  if jeff russel came in the red sox reliever and finished the game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score he would get the save and clemens would get the win                                                                      thats how i beleive it works  hope i could help the cowboy

   ugliest swingi am not sure i think the ugliset stance is jolio franco of the ranger i wonder how that bat comes around in time to hit the ball it looks bad but heyit get the job done   tac   ugliest stance of all time has to go to oscar gamble the man would practically kneel in front of home plate in order to have a small strike zone hes just lucky that strike zone size isnt determined by how big your afro is  im outta here like vladimir alan  
   do you have a better email address mr lurie  im afraid i cant get the short version to work  in any case on winfield  yes his career ba is a mere 000  he didnt beat this until his sixth year in the majors and has only topped it once since 0000  his peak was in the early 00s and included some rather impressive seasons  but then hes also had other scattered great performances like 0000 and 0000  definitely not a smooth career curve  cheers valentine

entirely meaningless  at least if it has meaning we dont know how to find it  i did not say i could predict the future  you most certainly did  i really dont want to get into a didsodidnot debate with you  but this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement  i did not say  nor did i imply that i could predict the future  you have inferred that my comments meant this and you have based your rebuttal of my comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in regard to clutch hitting   sabo000000000000000000 samuel000000000000000000  sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel  yet you would pinchhit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter  right  id call that predicting the future  that is your opinion that sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel  the above data is for a 0year period ending last season last season samuel batted 000 while sabo hit 000 not park adjusted this season they are both hitting below 000 albeit sabo with more at bats  i will agree that over his career sabo has been a better hitter than samuel but i will also remind you that samuel has been a better hitter in certain situations than sabo  i did not predict that sabo would choke nor that samuel would get a hit  i expressed my opinion that had i been the reds manager or even a reds fan that i would prefer to have samuel hit in that situation than sabo   if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel  im sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance  you just wouldnt have used this particular aspect of prior performance  is this not correct  right  i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past  overall performance lr splits even matching hittingpitching styles  all of these will give me some advantage if used properly  ah  properly  yes  i see  even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance  and in this case everything else pointed to sabo  please help me  what exactly is everything else that pointed to sabo   well yes  you are aware of its existance  you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling  yet you rather forcefully state the opposite  you dont seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important id say this is insulting  i must say i was not aware of the publication  can you email me the information regarding its availability  and i guess i must apologize to all of those who have done extensive  study on say supply side economics  i didnt mean to insult you but i never did believe you were on the right path  im sorry for my contrary opinionposition  i also regret that i dont have the ability to prove that you are wrong  but you are    i believe that by seasons end that chris sabos batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch situations  i cant prove that it will happen so i guess well  just have to wait and see  is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year  or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall  it is what it says it is  if you mean the first then as you say well just have to wait and see  but the second is a much stronger statement  in fact it suggests a rule  we can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years  i think you will agree that if the rule didnt work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do any better this year  right   the second is your statement not mine   im not going to get into case analysis  sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit poorly in 00 as well  you can also find those who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit well in 00  well actually i havent yet  but im not finished looking that is i havent yet found someone who hit significantly below his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years  0000  00 and then reversed that relationship in 0000   gamblers fallacy  unless there is reason to expect consistency a run proves nothing  can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next  ive seen a detailed study of why i shouldnt expect it to correlate  nope  sorry  but if you were interested in a reason why i expect chris sabos ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could  if you were interested in a reason why i expect joe carters ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could  but youre not interested in that because you think that those conclusions could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire baseball population  and they cant be   the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid  and i dont see how you can deny it  as for total idiot  yes  if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely  the problem here is that i do believe you  i accept your work i believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based on prior clutch history is meaningless  no better than a coin toss i actually do accept your work  as it happens i also have an opinion that in certain situations for certain players a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in projecting future player performance  for that player and chris sabo is one such player   so tell me  does the term fit  or do you have an open mind  well since i defer to your statistical wisdom i think i must have an open mind  now we have to pose the same question

  in article mssc0y0u00dnnetcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer writes  my supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players  this may be the root of the confusion  please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind  note that i am not yet saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand  suppose we have a simplified lotto game  detailed explanation deleted   indeed you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement to  rebut my opinion you have made an analogy with a game of chance your hypothesis assumes that the lotto players have no impact on the selection of the numbers and hence their ability to win  well thats certainly true in lotto  but it has absolutely nothing to do with the sport of baseball  when you start down the wrong path you finish down the wrong path      i repeat  i do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting performance  i do however think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance may for some players indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance and i think chris sabo is such a player     the beastmaster    mark singer     mssnetcomcom

   amazingly pitchers no matter how good their mechanics are not machines  cy young winners dont pitch in a vaccuum unaware of how their offenses are doing  the braves pitching staff is already showing signs of cracking under the strain of knowing theyre not going to get many if any runs  unfortunately the braves pitchers were so bad for so long that the organization put so much stress and i mean stress on pitching that they completely ignored hitting  the braves right now are looking woefully similar to the braves of the midseventies  heaven help us     econdukeedu     flsecondukeedu     flsecondukeedu    flseconduke s  to my correspondents  my email has been changed                       e l                         my new address is  flsecondukeedu            d f            if mail bounces try flsraphaelacpubdukeedu               u  
   the term stopper is generally used to refer to a pitcher one who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going on a losing streak  the braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description although right now id expect smoltz or glavine to take the mantle  what the braves lack however is an offensive stopper somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump theres just no one there  the braves got rid of their best pure hitter lonnie smith and only terry pendleton on the current roster has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit  oh and another thing that worries me  ron gant seems to have slowed down a step  thats scary  a slow ron gant doesnt have much going for him   econdukeedu     flsecondukeedu     flsecondukeedu    flseconduke s  to my correspondents  my email has been changed                       e l                         my new address is  flsecondukeedu            d f            if mail bounces try flsraphaelacpubdukeedu               u

  in article cjkuo000symanteccom cjkuosymanteccom jimmy kuo writes   gt0000eprismgatechedu michael andre mule writes     what is the maximum runs allowed before a stopper can get credit for a   relief ie if a stopper comes in with a 0 run lead does he getcredit    with the save   if you come in and pitch the last three inningsand your team was ahead    when you got out there and wins the game you get a save   sorta correct if you pitched at least 0 inningsentered with your team    in the lead was the pitcher when the game endedthe game was never tied    during your stint and your team won you get a save  well the rulebook says that in the opinion of the scorer you must have  pitched effectively for your 0 innings  this save is not automatic  unlike the others  someone in sabr actually looked at these games a few years ago  and found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one  of the games  even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly  allowing 0 or 0 runs  seeing hearing my two sense worth john rickert rickertnextworkrosehulmanedu  
   right  so who cares which player gets credited as long as the team gets more runs  if a player helps the team get more r and rbi but  doesnt score them all himself who cares  amusing isnt it  seems only the sdcns realize how much baseball is a team game combining efforts from every player for the win  consider the red sox game last night  the sox won 00 in the bottom of the 00th  who won the game  clemens pitched a strong nine  innings allowing only two runs ryan pitched a couple shutout innings though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so quantrill pitched a couple of innings gave up the goahead run and  got credited with the win when the sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning  looks like a team effort to me  yet only quantrill got credit for the win  how about the offense dawson and vaughn hit i think hrs early in the game  without either  one the sox would have lost in nine quintana led off the 00th with a solid single zupcic pinchran for quintana providing the speed to go from first  to third when cooper ripped a second single in the inning melvin avoided the dp getting the run home with a sac fly  not much of  a help but it was something scrub richardson then hit a double scoring the speedy cooper all the  way from first  hills lack of defense helped  cooper and zupcic were credited with runs melvin and richardson were credited with rbis  but it seems to me that it was quintanas hit that set up the whole inning  and did melvin really contribute as much as richardson  furthermore people seem to consider rbis to be more significant than runs  did melvin contribute more than cooper  cooper provided the gamewinning baserunner and moved the tying run to third base with only one out  assigning credit based on runs and rbis is clearly ridiculous  you can argue that obp and slg dont show you who came through in the clutch but rrbi dont do any better  at least obp and slg dont claim to try to tell you that  heres to the red sox who contributed to last nights victory all 00 of them  valentine

mike lavalliere has been accused of poor work habits and general sloth recently probably not malingering just as he was being released  its interesting that nobody heard much about these problems before if they were so important  i have heard sanders called many things as well i have not heard him called lazy given the 0sport phenomenon it would be difficult to label him as such  exactly so  which means his media detractors have had to say other things about him  i believe its a general phenomenon that if writers dont like you theyll find a label that will stick no matter who you are  i find myself more interested in the selection of labels than in why writers feel they need to act this way  not that this fascinates me that much either  uh the original authors point was that black and white players were por trayed differently by the media and towards this he gave a highly selected list to prove his case sanders name showed up eventually i dispute that sanders has ever been called lazy by the media   hmm big ego possible club house disturbance etc is that good press  no but it isnt the total extent of the press he received in pittsburgh where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and spoiled by the local columnists  again the actual words used may shift around with time and expediency but lazy tends to be higher on the list for nonwhite players at least in my subjective opinion  aside it might be interesting for somebody to do an archival study on player descriptions before and after the color barrier was broken and on teams like the red sox which have been traditionally white nowadays most people think of carl yastrzemski as one of those bluecollar hardworking guys but in the early 00s he was often portrayed as a lazy bum  really  hmm i never heard anyone accuse canseco of being lazy nor sierra  ive heard accusations that canseco was a bad fielder but could be a great one if he put his mind to it  ignoring whether or not he is a  actually dave stewart is was one of the most vocal about this in any  event that is not lazy  at least one poster in the last week has fired off a major screed on the cansecoislazy issue so i think your point is at best a quibble and probably weaker than that  uh that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first it is not a quibble then to state that the media did not portray canseco as being  lazy if the other person chooses to so accuse him after my post that does not make it a quibble and in fact the media around here tended to play up his time in the wieght room hardly lazy and hardly a quibble have you ever seen any mediot portray canseco as lazy unconcerned with his fielding yes lazy no  bad fielder i think this is still interesting  for that matter i think cansecos colorful offfield antics get lots more national attention than those of say roger clemens  well hes had a few more of them  at least more that youve heard about  i think one of the questions here surrounds selective reporting  having said that i have to say that the selective reporting hypothesis has the potential to be unfalsifiable at least by those of us who arent reporters police or private investigators  well canseco has been involved in several felonies including his highspeed record carrying concealed firearms and of course the domestic violence  clemens had a runin at a bar canseco had that as well and in both cases the coverage was relatively minimal  puckett stewart jackson   i said overrepresent nonwhites  three anecdotal data points dont make an interesting counterargument  btwwhich jackson are we talking about here  reggie bo darrin danny or   uh if the only evidence offered is anecdotal how can it be objected that the counter to it is also anecdotal  and it seems like everybody who has ever won a batting title among others has been accused at some time of caring more for his own stats than for the good of the team  it also seems to me that youre  kirby puckett i have never heard this accusation made of puckett i  have heard it of boggs actually i believe it of him but thats another  matter  not living in minnesota i cant say whether or not this line has ever been used against kirby there  as far as boggs goes im not sure why you bring him up since hes one of the obvious prototypes for the line i quoted along with ted williams rod carew and many others  uh yes and i agree with your assesment of boggs rather specifically however you did say everybody who has ever won a batting title has been accused of selfishness i have not ever anywhere heard this said of puckett pendleton either similarly brett b williams and others    how about daryl strawberry and i think the plus or minus refers more to  the born again types ie butler and gaetti  again you seem to be making an argument from anecdotes  on the other hand my argument by is of the becausejonsaysso variety if we have no other data  i have to admit i have problems generating lists of nonwhite players who became infamous for their religious or political beliefs while names like butler gaetti dravecky knepper hersheiser et al come rolling out  there are others perhaps they are simply not as outspoken except in the case of the bornagain types i mention  mike

  about the infield fly rule so if hes feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up  if it isnt caught hes probably scored a run  if it is hes probably headed for aaa    unless hes deion sanders in which case he just heads back to the dugout and waits for his next baserunningblunder opportunity   econdukeedu     flsecondukeedu     flsecondukeedu    flseconduke s  to my correspondents  my email has been changed                       e l                         my new address is  flsecondukeedu            d f            if mail bounces try flsraphaelacpubdukeedu               u

   the best home run i have ever seen came off believe it or not roger clemens sorry val a couple of years ago he threw a ball to incaviglia which was literally at inkys neck and he absolutely  hammered the crap out of it after the swing clemens nonchalantly motioned for a new ballhe didnt even turn around to look or even get upset the ball hit the lights in the leftfield standard some 00 or so feet about the green monster over 000 feet above the ground total  truly an amazing shot  i agree  home runs off clemens are always memorable  kinda like eclipses and hurricanes  they dont happen very often  cheers valentine

  in article 0000apr0000000000000vflparamaxcom davidmgvls0vflparamaxcom david madden writes     0 if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time x  0 to 0       without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base       as if walked  this last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases considerably  suppose the pitcher uses up n0 of his n pickoff attempts  the runner can probably stretch his lead off the base given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it right this time   if it encouraged the runner to stretch his lead it would probably also result ina greater number of pickoffs i think it would be a workable rule but it would probably be best to experiment in another league before trying it in the bigs  clay d

  keller writes  real long but good post on yankee trades omitted    i disagree on one point  velarde  yes maybe the yanks should have let  him develop but he rode the columbus shuttle way too many times to do   so  probably the fault of george but no matter now  his usefulness is   done  he will not be able to develop into a good player this deep in his   career  at least i dont think so  his fielding is horrendous at 0rd maybe  hed be good at short he cant his the curve at all and i think all  his trips from new york to columbus and back have demoralized him to the  point that he just doesnt care  get rid of him i saythe sooner the  better for both the yanks and velarde          keith kellerlets go rangers     velarde hasnt been to columbus if i recall for about three years  granted he hasnt been a full time player but when he does play ive always thought he had a good bat he might be demoralized about not playing full time but he hasnt been shuttled around  i think hes been in new york ever since he had 00 hits in 000 ab back in 0000 or 00 i believe   i dont think he is gold glove calibre but he doesnt boot it around either  i think if velarde is given a chance he could become extremely productive  i dont have any stats to back this up and i dont know if his defense would cost any games but i think he could help  and he has this year  he has 0 hr already  same goes for jim leyrtiz  he has a big mouth but he does get the job done when he concentrates  i think the situation with leyritz is that he believes he is a potential superstar and he gets pissed about not playing  i think he might have realized something when the marlins or rockies didnt select him the yanks need to worry about the bullpen right now kamieniecki and wickmanmilitello in the bullpen ouch  im praying that the bp will return to last years form     chris               what im listening to                     giantwamumdedu                                                                    anything that guitar god                                 go yankees        dann huff plays on                            
   rule 000k states it is interference by a batter or runner when  in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base  he runs outside the threefoot line or inside to the left of the foul line and in the umpires judgment interferes with the field er taking the throw at first base  the key word in the rule is and a runner isnt out just for running out of the baseline hes out for interfering with the fielding of the ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first because the catcher opted to throw the ball over the batterrunners head theres no inter ference  sorry i still dont buy it  youre certainly right that the runner is not out merely for running out of the baseline he must interfere with the play  but the argument here is over what constitutes interference you certainly cannot infer from what youve quoted that the batterrunner must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference you havent posted a definition of interference at all  imo this calls for one of the approved rulings that go in small print in the rulebook  something like  approved ruling if in the judgement of the umpire the runner by running to the left of the allowed path caused the fielder to make a bad throw blocks the vision of the fielder receiving the throw or otherwise impedes the defensive teams making a play on him the batterrunner shall be judeged guilty of interference  or  approved ruling the runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball   in the absence of such an approved ruling i claim that this is a poor rules trivia questionsince it cannot be authoritatively answered   len reed holos software inc voice 000 0000000 ext 00 domain lbrholosatlgausa   uucp lbrholos0uucp

  this chatting about the best player of all time is pointless  you cant compare players from different eras    of course you can  you just have to be careful about what conclusions you draw  if you will notice the best pitchers stat wise were in the 00s and 00s and the best all around hitters probably came from the 00s to 00s    huh  the 00s and 00s were the worst decades for great pitching  grove vance dean and not a whole lot else    as for the best allaround hitters statwise ruth gehrig foxx greenberg hornsby cobb etc all played before the 00s  statwise the 00s were  a graveyard for hitters  now we have a great number of great pitchers and an equally great number of great hitters and fielders also  how do you know  which ones do you consider great  about fielding the gloves were much smaller than they are now in the early years of baseball  maybe a hitter like sheffield with the 000 ba 00hr and 000 rbieven though it was probably a fluke year can be compared to a mantle because the pitching sheffield faces is faster and not to mention better the  so  sheffield also has better shoes  more time between pitches  you can run the comparison but there are lots of things to take into account  same could be said for frank thomas who is said to be the best hitter since ted williams although franks defense does suck  well can we compare them or cant we  all i am saying is that you cant compare players from different eras if you want a best player try choosing best players from different eras that  why  we can compare players to the standard of their era and we can keep in mind eratoera differences without throwing up our hands in despair  way there is reasonable basis for comparison  you havent shown us whats unreasonable about the mantlesheffield comparison that you yourself did  roger  
  i feel that talking about speeding up baseball games is like trying to keep signal to noise ratio high on recsportsbaseball  no matter how much you talk about it or how reasonable your arguments there will always be people who quote an entire article with signatures to make a one line comment reply or woof  whether through their stupidity denseness or excitement and overeagerness to bless us with their insight no matter what is said they will always keep doing it  same with ballgames  no matter how much it might benefit the game for the umpires to enforce the rules and for the playersmanagerscoaches to stop wasting our time  it just aint gonna happen  rudy  i agree  
  craigesadhpcom craig eid writes  these things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real  businessman ex  safeway president peter magowan to figure it out just  like he used to tell his checkers if the customers dont come back i dont need as many checkers this isnt a knock on bob lurie  he was a competent businessman but he didnt deal much with the general public  interesting article craig  its amazing how hard it is to get baseball teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their customers  no other business could ever get away with the 00th century  attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs  i guess the owners look at baseballs high growth rate and ask why its necessary to bring 00th century business practices into the game but they dont realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they pay in terms of longterm popularity by not doing better by the game and its fans  greg

   the reason im unhappy with the length of games today is summed up above for an extra 00 minutesgame average in the al and an extra 00 minutes average in the nl im seeing fewer runs score   now what i think i am seeing is more pitches  more strikeouts over 0game in the al over 0game more in the nl more walks 0game more in  yep  and the ks dont have to denote a slow game either  last night sid fernandez was mowing the giants hitters down 00 ks in 0 innings yet the first 0 00 innings of the game were quite brisk  he also threw 000 pitches leading me to believe it isnt just the number of pitches that determines the length of a game but the  behavior between pitches      michael zimmers                                      voice  000 000 0000   softhelp  suppliers to software developers         data   000 000 0000

   i dont understand this at all  matt williams has demonstrated throughout his career that he will not wait for good pitches to hit he wont take walks  hed rather swing  if im the opposing pitcher why would i groove a fastball to williams and have him hit it well when i know that williams will swing and miss or at least not hit very well at a low and away curve  matts problem is really more ability than attitude  it isnt that hes got it in his mind that he wants to swing away but rather that hes still a total sucker for the curve ball  it looked for a while in 0000 that he was getting better but its still his weak point  as to whether it does him any good to have bonds behind him the  netstatmavens will probably tell you theres no reason that it should but if he thinks it will it might be a selffulfilling prophecy  as to whether the giants lineup is optimal  who knows  batting bonds the teams best hitter fifth does seem to be odd but the 0 and 0 hitters arent exactly messrs oba so they arent giving much up there  and although clark isnt the overall offensive force that bonds is he seems better suited to the 0 spot  assuming of course that he starts hitting one of these days      michael zimmers                                      voice  000 000 0000   softhelp  suppliers to software developers         data   000 000 0000

  whittycvhpcom joe whitty writes  thomas theiner theindamabusinformatikrwthaachende wrote  hi there    im german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now  there are many problems occuring for me one of them is the era statistic for  pitchers what does it say   era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game  thus if a pitcher pitched 0 innings and gave up 0 earned run his 0 inning equivelent perfomance would be 0 earned runs thus his era is 000  to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 0  era  erip  0  i think there is another formula for era  i heard something about it last  year  im not sure what it is but im gonna give it a stab  it allows for a pitcher to pitch more than 0 innings at a time and not benefit cuz it uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched          era  er00outs recorded  like i said im not sure this is exactly it but im pretty sure they changed it to something of the sort   an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error  more specifically if an error occurs that represented the third out all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game  here are some examples  if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base  if an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after this error and not counted as earned runs  if a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who were left on base  if the those runners who were left on base score and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game  i hope this explains things for you  joe

   this weeks play    it took three days to get to us but ill try anyway as i naturally havent seen the answer   with runners at first and second and one out the batter hits an  easy pop fly to the third baseman    a the umpires declare the infield fly rule and the third baseman  lets the ball drop the runner at second heads for third and the  third baseman flips the ball to the short stop who tags the bag  before the runner  safe the correct call is infield fly batter out if fair runners may advance at own risk gotta tag up if caught etc it is not a force and the pop was not caught so regardless of whether the ss tags 0b or 0b it wasnt clear above he hasnt got the runner out   b the umpires dont declare the infield fly rule and the third  baseman allows the ball to drop and throws to the short stop who  tags the runner from second while the runner is between second and  third  out see rule 000l approved ruling below in this case the umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule doesnt apply sounds like a bad call here but thats not the point the batter is not out so a force situation is created therefore the runner is out   unless by rule 000l the ball is dead and the batter is safe then i guess the runners would advance unmolested  i cant really tell from 000l that the ball is dead in this situation     whats the call in a and b  pertinent rules 000 definition of infield fly when an infield fly is called runners may advance at their own risk if on an infield fly rule the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball the ball remains in play despite the provisions of rule 000l the infield fly rule takes precedence  000l a batter is out when an infielder intentionally drops a fair fly ball or line drive with first first and second first and thrid or firstsecond and third base occupied before two are out the ball is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base or bases approved ruling in this situation the batter is not out if the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground except when the infield fly rule applies    jim dean internet jimdeanbnrca     national capital baseball league mildmannered computer scientist phone president pitcher my knuckler bellnorthern research ottawaont booth    not too legit to hit  00 000 phone 000 0000000 fax 0000000     phone 000 0000000

  is it just me or does bichette look totally lost in the outfield  hes been playing horrible defense baylor said after wednesdays game that he wanted to shake up the lineup a little because bichette has been having a rough time defensively and jerald clark has not been hitting he was true to his word i went to thursdays game and gerald young was in right and daryl boston who has a very hot bat was in left baylor was careful to say though that he didnt necessarily mean for these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two a shot while clark and bichette were not playing well  in defense of bichette it looks like right field in mile high stadium is a bitch to play some of the visiting outfielders have been having some problems too although bobby bonilla made a great catch crashing into the wall to rob daryl boston of an extra base hit in thursdays game  greg  
     huckabays counting frames for bat speed discussion ommited     well its just studying tape frame by frame  thats all  the biggest  thing that you notice however is how bastardized the strike zone has   become  death to the umpires union  the plate is 00 0 across  not 00  call the high strikes strikes and quit calling pitches 0  outside strikes  theyre balls      speaking of this 00 wide strike zone    id sure like to see cameras placed in each major league park such that    an overview shot of home plate is available  cbs had this during the   ws or did i just dream it    these pictures would be a feedback device for the umpires so that they can   see just how terrible or not there calls were  tapes could be sent to   the league as evidence of bad ballstrike umpiring  tapes are available   as evidence of bad outsafe calls on the bases  i guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series and in fact all year have been pretty much consistently correct  remember the rule says its a strike if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone  i would certainly agree that  high strikes are not called who could argue this point but all in all i think in and out is called pretty well   rstimets

  ive read all of the followups to this but i thought id go back to the original article to make specific comments about the method   jaomegatestcom john oswalt said  he has obtained the play by play records in computer readable form for every major league baseball game for the past several years he devised an algorithm which i call sumoversituations and wrote a computer program to calculate every major league players contribution using it  it works like this  look at every situation in every game in a baseball season  a situation is determined by inning score where the baserunners are and how many outs there are  for each situation count how many times the team eventually won the game that the situation occured in and divide by the number of times the situation came up to come up with a value for that situation  this was first done by george lindsey in the late 00searly 00s and reported in   articlean investigation of strategies in baseball authorgeorge r lindsey journaloperations research issuevolume 00 0 julyaugust 0000 pp 000000  later pete palmer did the same thing using simulated seasons to generate a larger set of data to avoid the kind of smallsample anomalies that other people have worried about  he reported this in thehiddengameofbaseball with john thorn  gary skoog modified the method a bit and did some work on what he called a value added measure based on these situational values his were based directly on marginal runs though not on win probabilities these results as applied to the 000 season were reported in one of the bill james baseball abstract books 0000  help me out here somebody  for example a situation might be inning 0 score 00 runner on second and no outs  there were 0000 regular season major league games last year  with the rockies and marlins there will be more this year say this situation came up in 000 of those and the team ahead won 00 of them  then the value of this situation is 000  description of method look at change in win probability based on the at bat  plus any baserunning and creditdebit the player by that amount each time  he gets a plate appearance  now for each player sum up all his atbat and baserunning values for the season to obtain an overall value for that player  obviously the sum of all players values for each game and for the season as a whole will be 0  thats only because you always credit x to the batter and x to the pitcher theres no validation involved  ok theres a very big problem here that nobody has yet commented on youre adding probabilities and probabilities dont add  runs you can add the total team runs breaks down into how many runs joe contributed plus how many runs fred contributed etc  but probabilities dont work that way  if bob increases his teams chance of winning by 0 in each of 000 pas that does not mean that bob increased his teams chance of winning by 000  in fact it doesnt mean anything because the units are screwy  i agree and disagree  john is saying that the batters efforts will result in 0 more wins then losses  while you are probably correct that 000 does not mean 0 more wins then losses it means something  i would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 0 in each of 000 pas then i would a player who increased my chances of winning by 0 in each of 000 pas  thus there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between johns statistic and winning games  thus before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is  consider an example  bob hits a 0out solo hr in the bottom of the first about 00 on your scale  he does the same thing again in the fourth with the score tied for another 00  and again in the seventh with the score tied for another 00  and finally in the ninth to win the game by a score of 00 for a value of 00  bob hit 0 solo hr in 0 plate appearances and was credited by your method with 00  00  00  0  00  but what does that mean  was bob 00 responsible for the win  certainly not the defense is always 00 responsible if you include pitching in that and bob wasnt pitching  in fact bob was only 00 of the offense which is a lot but not even close to 000  furthermore what about the other 0 team runs  say they all came on solo hr by fred then fred was hitting hr to tie up the game which are just as valuable as hr to take the lead see lindsey and fred will himself have accrued a good 0 rating or so  so fred and bob combined have amassed 000 of a win in one game  theres clearly a problem here  the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has  first we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game  second remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning  that is a player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases thus im not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 0 in that game  sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one  also the pitchers bad performances giving up 0 runs may have given them a large negative percentage for that game  also any batter that pulled an 00 night would give large negatives      greg thinking about the right things but his intuition is off the mark  closers are enormously important  the total number of runs value is outweighed by when they come or are prevented from comming the doubling which greg allows is not enough  in another article i proposed a test of this  we can predict a teams  wonlost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs total they score and allow without regard to when those runs score in the game  if late runs are really more important than early runs then looking only at late runs should lead to a better predictor right  no but really only because you have a smaller sample size  i would think however that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning  and realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation not a blow out  it is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning  look a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games  on the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win  the offence has many more outs to do something about  but i am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either  if i am down 0 runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth         heres another thought experiment apply this method to basketball  what you find is that points scored in the first half of the game have almost exactly no value because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play furthermore the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with no time on the clock gets a 00 for the game while the star forward who  scored 00 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero  does this make sense   no but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made  look if you are down 0 point with 0 seconds left there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball  and do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls bad defense etc caused a negative chance that the team would win   from reading all of the discussion on this statistic i feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda at first look this statistic valadates clutchness  but it really does not  cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down  ive never seen convincing proof that this really happens so if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except for a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to player performance  there is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness  certainly we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example  we may find for instance that a home run increases your chance of winning by 00 on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 0 i bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses  how do we evaluate relief pitchers  say john and sam have the exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs ks bbs etc  both had exceptional numbers  john however only pitched in closer situations while sam was a mop up man  who was more valuble to their team  probably john  who was the better  pitcher  they were probably about the same

  theres a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid  i thought id put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant  i splurged and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars the highestpaid player is frank thomas at 000k  i cut some players like kenny lofton chris hoiles keith mitchell tim wakefield and a bunch of pitchers all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a cost of 0 million for the lot of them  the total team salary is  0000000 averaging slightly over 000k a player  if thats too steep you can dump thomas and bagwell replacing them with paul sorrento and a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars and still have one of the best teams in the majors  p juan guzman 000 p mussina000 p castillo    000 p eldred      000 p rhodes000 p militello   000 rp rojas000 rp beck000 rp melendez   000 rp hernandez000 rp nied000 c rodriguez000 c piazza      000 0b thomas000 0b bagwell    000 0b knoblauch000 0b barberie000 0b gomez0000 0b palmer000 ss listach000 ss pena000 lf gonzalez000 cf lankford000 rf rsanders000 of plantier000   ted frank                  however teel should have mentioned that though  thf0kimbarkuchicagoedu   his advice is legally sound if you follow it  the u of c law school       you will probably wind up in jail standard disclaimers                           james donald in misclegal

  the rotation has changed due to a strange injury to scott erickson  he  developed a twinge in the stomach area and has been taken out of the  rotation  new rotation to the best of my minds knowledge is kevin tapani jim deshais pat mahomes willie banks  add mike trombley in there somewhere since they need five people  mark guthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long lefty  as to ss and 0b short will be played by scott leius who played short for much of his career  before the twins  at third mike pagliarulo and jeff reboulet will platoon  pags and terry jorgenson will platoon at third with reboulet as the backup infielder  pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who lead the league in da in 0000 muffing what should be routine grounders heck muffing a grounder i would probably have gotten to  jorgenson did nothing exceptional that i noticed  leius missed a ball i think gagne would have reached we will certainly miss gags glove this season  winfield has struggled during preseason  sunday against the colorado  rockies he went 0 for 0 with 0 rbis and scored once  he looked pretty good there  contrary to what the mediots have been saying he looked reasonable at first  he isnt mid00s hrbek but then neither is the pretty big guy himself any more note  im used to seeing the twins 0b looking kinda big on the field but not that big  if he hits vaguely like last year hes a perfectly good first baseman  note  much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings  winfield may have big holes in his defensive game that didnt show up he didnt have to pick any bad throws for example but ill take what i saw so far  david thornley have tickets will travel to dome

        philadelphia at chicago  teams tied for 0st after sunday      dick redding battled chet brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series  one friday one saturday and a goodold sunday doubleheader what could be better declared ernie banks  perhaps the fact that the cubs are challenging      its pitching its always been pitching that weve lacked announced ryne sandberg  if we can get by brewer then beat carlton alexander or bunning  preferrably 0 of the last three  well know we might be able to win      lord i hope we pull it off      the phils scored once in the top of the first richie ashburn singled pete rose followed with a hit sending ashburn around second  kiki cuyler cut the ball off in left center and threw a bullet in to ernie banks who threw to ron santo to get ashburn at third  rose went to second on the play      christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center moving pete rose to third  schmidt was walked  the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them  both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw 000000 walks this year  chuck klein is starting to hit very well and he lashed a double into a gap in rightcenter  cool papa bells speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent schmidt from scoring  nellie fox was walked and bob boone grounded out to second ending the threat        teams are starting to realize that you dont have to pitch to schmidt or torrienti and that is lowering their run total  it puts a lot of pressure on klein and dick allen who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells rose at first and its a credit to the phillies that theyve been able to sustain their pace  the picthers have slumped at times  so came the analysis from frank chance      the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit thomas grounder moved him to second and  after sandberg made out  billy williams singled home a run  in the sixth ron santo launched a tworun homer to make it 00  dick redding got in trouble in the eighth as schmidt singled and klein singled him to third  ed reulbach entered to face fox but dick allen popped out of the dugout to hit  allen doubled to right but luckily for the cubs williams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense he fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third  lance parrish hitting for boone was walked and bruce sutter entered  larry bowa grounded into a 000 double play but ed delahanty walked as a pinchhitter  desiring a strikeout since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick trillo pinchrunning at third chance brought in lee smith who induced a popup to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder ending the inning  the cubs took the win 00 moving a game behind the phillies      steve carlton was called upon to battle 0finger brown saturday  to get another righthander in the lineup ron santo moved to first and bill madlock played third  unfortunately brown allowed six doubles and the cub bullpen was worn down even more as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against lefty  madlock batting sixth had knocked two doubles of his own driving home four runs  gabby hartnett hit two home runs and cuyler added another and the score was 00 cubs after six innings  the phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth as the cubs grabbed 0 more runs to ice an 000 triumph      sundays twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one point including a rare outsidethepark home run in the second game off robin roberts  grover alexander of the phils took the first contest 00 but the cubs captured the second one 00 with waddell gaining the win  bruce sutter tossed two innings for the save though he allowed one run in the eighth  the cardinals stood half a game behind these coleaders and would conclude their series with the expos on monday       montreal at st louisaugust 00 0way tie for 0st      dennis martinez is on a roll and he continued it versus john tudor friday the expos have a wide variety of hitters and  while they arent among the alltime greats they are getting the job done  after winning their first first two games they suddenly found themselves only 0 00 games out of first in this wacky season      martinez triumphed 00 on friday and williams outdueled dizzy dean 00 saturday  however the cardinals refused to give up winning 00 on sunday the cards captured mondays game too as steve carlton outdueled steve rogers 00  were really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed remarked lou brock  i dont see why we cant win this division      the phillies and cubs may have some reasons for them  twothirds of the way through the season there is a 0way tie for first       new york at pittsburghaugust 00 0 straight 00 wins for bucs now 0 back  but in 0th     when your team is in a slump like we are the worst thing is to play in a pitchers park like this spoke gil hodges before the series  keith hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year and it must be giving them an extra 00 wins  the pirates have made only 00 errors all season 0 ahead of the second place dodgers  error totals tend to be around 00 for the best defensive alltime teams      rube foster defeated sid fernandez 00 friday and candelaria outshone seaver 00 saturday in a game featuring some outstanding defense  when nolan ryan and two relivers 0hit the mets in another 00 win sunday the pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the 000 mark  they had been unable to several times in the past month  bert blyleven met dwight gooden in the afternoon game  both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs  a solo shot by rusty staub of the mets and a tworun blast by ralph kiner for the pirates  the mets darryl strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off jesse orosco working his second inning after mookie wilson pinchran for gary carter at second  with one out and a runner on first lee mazilli was sent in to pinchhit  the pirates countered with kent tekulve placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting barry bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter  tekulve induced a groundout forcing strawberry at second  he slid hard into honus wagner preventing the pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon  tekulve allowed a hit but clemente threw mazilli out at third from near the right field line ending the inning  tug mcgraw relieved randy myers who entered to pitch the eighth and got one out before bonds launched a rocket to deep center running through the stop sign at third to score an insidethepark homer to win  the pirates had scored an improbable 0 straight 00 wins and had moved to within 0 games of first place with seven weeks to go       san francisco at boswauktaaugust 00      another sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule as the giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldnt tire  in fact reported manager john mcgraw once this rough part of the schedule is over maybe as early as this coming week we may shift to a 0man rotation again for a little while      juan marichal continued his hot pitching friday beating lew burdette and the braves 00  willie mays had all four rbis on 0 hits  rick reuschel faced joe niekro saturday in a slugfest  the braves park had been a homer haven but this took the cake as the giants won a seesaw affair 0000 willie mays had three homers willie mccovey eddie matthews and don baylor had two and hank aaron ernie lombardi biz mackey and mel ott had one each  the braves had collected 000 home runs going into sundays doubleheader putting them on a pace for 000 which would be 0 short of the national league record  they were still a tad behind the 00 yankees pace they had allowed over 000 though  vida blue actually got the win after retiring 0 batters in the fifth  he allowed only a run in the sixth but faltered in the seventh  joe mcginnity earned the save      in the doubleheader the braves hoyt wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game but hank aaron homered off bill foster in the eighth as the braves won 00  the giants took the second game however by a 00 score the homer by aaron was a magical 000 by the braves however they fell to three game below 000 making a comeback extremely unlikely       san diego at cincinnatiaug 00  randy jones faced ewell blackwell in the first of this 0game series and the padres felt rather good  with don mattingly straining his back in the last cleveland game the trade looked even better  mcgriffs batting average was even rising  of course the bench was very poor and joe gordon was only adequate in the outfield but these were minor problems since the pitching was holding up      jones pitched a good game friday and won 00  mcgriff launched two home runs  mel harder earned a win with the help of mark davis and ray narleski saturday 00 was the final score  tom candiotti battled satchel paige to a 00 tie through eight innings before departing  the game was scoreless for 0 more innings until the thirteenth  paige had departed after 00 and john franco hurled a scoreless inning  tom browning was working his second scoreless inning when dave winfield doubled with one out and joe gordon was pitched around  thurm munson doubled both runners home and the padres gamed a 00 win  the threegame sweep had pulled the giants into a tie with the reds  though the reds denied it the highly emotional series with the dodgers may have taken too much out of them       brookangeles at houstonaugust 00      another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the astrodome  the astros sent joe niekro to the hill in the first game opposite don drysdale  normally drysdale remarked i would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them  i cant afford to with this team though we have to get our own runners going we cant afford to let the astros beat us  he then winked and said well maybe davis will get decked once      the fact that glenn davis leads the team in homers with six  is primarily why he would be decked but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season  the hitting on this team is a little better but the power is all doubles and triples  still carl furillo is the main reason no astro home runs were hit over the weekend as he threw two runners out trying for insidethepark homers  for those unaware of the nastness of the astros park they have a 00foot high gray wall all around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs  the foul poles are 000 feet from home plate but the alleys are 000 feet away with center field at 000 feet  its as if some threeyearold threw a tantrum and told his playmates if i cant hit home runs nobody will hit home runs remarked roy campanella      the dodgers stole five bases friday but the astros decided to revitalize the baltimore chopping that had failed 0 weeks before for tonight anyway davis jim wynn and jose cruz did not have to mess with their swings according to the manager  after poles and willie wells reached base via the baltimore chop drysdale decked jose cruz with a pitch  he responded with a tworun double but wynn  playing first for davis  popped up and the astros didnt score any more in that inning  they did score 0 in the fourth to erase a 00 deficit and the astros wound up winning 00  they threatened to do even better the next game as tommy john would be their opponent walt alston met privately with the starters at 0 am before the game      i think i know how we can beat the baltimore chop he explained      how can we do that pee wee reese wondered      theyre going to be beating the ball down so weve got to be ready to throw on the run  steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt but i want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws  well go with a shallow infield almost the whole time      the plan almost worked  mike scott allowed only two runs through eight innings but the astros got three two of them scored when bill doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third  00 astros was the final with dave smith earning another save  the dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill sunday as nolan ryan walked five three of whom scored in a 00 dodger win  fernando valenzuela lost the second game 00 to don sutton however as the dodgers thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough      were mostly a power team remarked ron cey  jackie and when he plays maury wills are our only real speed demons though a couple other plays can do it now and then  were sunk in a place like the astrodome  i guess thats why theyre so successful there  indeed it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome  the stros swiped 00 bases in 00 attempts giving them 000 on the season      standings after these weekend series aleast team                     w           l           gb new

  dave this has never happened to me before kirsch writes   correction nied was the only player identified in this book as a grade a prospect who was exposed to the draft according to bill james in the stop the presses section preceding his player evaluations he valued nied at 00 and said that nieds value does not increase significantly as a result of his selection although he did catch a break getting away from the strongest rotation in baseball   i thought bill james latest book completely and totally sucked  i bought it but will not purchase anything of his ever again without thoroughly looking at it first  what tripe  the book is inconsistent and filled with selective analysis  james claims to be looking forward and then makes some absolutely bizarre statements of value  not only that but i got the impression he probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name on it   to say i was disappointed is a grand understatement          gary huckabay       kevin kerr the al feldstein of the mid00s   a living argument for  if theres anything we love more than a huge     existence of parallel  sig its someone quoting 000 lines to add           universes       0 or 0 new ones  and consecutive posts too

  mssnetcomcom mark singer said  i meant that one should not let the exception make the rule    its not an exception  good players come up young most players who come up young will be good  this has always been the rule   are most players who come up young always good when theyre young or later  worse its not a shift  this is the way it has always been  several detailed studies of this have been done and theyve all shown that players arent coming up any younger or older than in the past and they arent  playing any more or less in the minors than they used to  the only thing that shifts is our memories of the good old days   damn  i was afraid you would say that   but all after the fact which makes it not applicable to the current discussion which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who hasnt established himself in the majors over the mediocre veteran  the padres played santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth playing    well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there  but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion  and i happen to agree   both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers expected to be among the best ever in baseball    not by recsportbaseball consensus  that may sound like an incredibly arrogant comment but ive found that the sdcn consensus when one exists is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of baseball people affiliated with mlb    i can believe that  im a newbie here so ill take your word  but alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long as they feel he can also hit a bit  lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded seasoning   i dont know who knows  i suppose the same people or similar who know he will be better than some other catcher  these are of  course just differing opinions  i read that his arm is not that strong i suppose somewhere there is some measurement of sb ratios and that he is still learning to call a game  that latter skill may be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of his performance but it is a tangible skill  i disagree in that i dont think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership is  i dont deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but i really dont see any way that we could ever know who they are  nicholss law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously  sorry  new  dont know nichols law  dont believe in catchers era  but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers any info on that    absolutely  the evidence is piling up year after year  the only other alternative is that the braves really dont know that their young players are on average better than their current starters  im not ruling out that kind of gross incompetence but i think the salaryschedule explanation is more charitable  in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind  a different decision than we would make must be financial  i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no   consider we know that the braves are about the strongest team in baseball right now even with olson and lemke and nixon and bream in the lineup  they have as good a chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has it actually makes some sense to say rather than making our team marginally better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly lets go ahead and compete this year with what we have and then bring up the studs only as we have to so that well still have them under reserve three years from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions  is it fair to the young players  no  does it make organizational sense  i think it does  well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions  i mean please dont tell me how to run my business  especially when im being successful    ci could make it 000 or 000 wins if you let me bring up lopez  slisten bobby  id like to  but the way i see it if he hits the big club this year well be paying megaarbitration bucks down the road in a couple of years and theres no way i want to do that  and continues with  we can win without him and then keep winning next year with him hows that  im sure you could be right  you could also be smoking some illegal substance  hey  thats a joke  dont get offended  please   hey id love to be wrong about this  if you think its unlikely id love to know why  dont cite anybodys innate ethical rectitude though unless you know them personally   well i cant cite anyones ethical rectitude because i dont know what it means    but again if it makes organizational sense then so be it  baseball is a business and if there is a solid business reason for keeping lopez on the farm then thats what the braves should do  i happen to believe that its a baseball decision  while you from your armchair may disagee i dont  i think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made  i predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training  i think it is a very normal decision to have made  it is certainly more reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers  sure it may be conservative  it may also be logical  i dont know what ethics have to do with it seems like pretty good common sense to me  the beastmaster     mark singer     mssnetcomcom

  i was watching peter gammons on espn last night and hes got me a little confused  while talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit from the fringe players theyll be facing mcgriff hitting 00 home runs sheffield getting 000 rbis and glavine winning 00 games  this was of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball has expanded early 00s late 00s late 00s  what really confused me though was the mention of al players who would do well next year  specifically roger clemens winning 00 games and the likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting 00 home runs  my question is  how in the hell will the rockiesmarlins help the al  the last time i looked there wasnt a lot of talent jumping leagues  did i miss something  dennis cleary dfclearyucdavisedu   i wondered the same thing  when he first mentioned it i thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over  and then in the examples from other years he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded  so since stats never lie   i guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making  every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that normally they would not have had there not been expansion  make sense

    well it really isnt this cut and dry but as a jay fan the thing i feared worst has happened the yanks sent down williams g and are going to start williams b in cf   i also believe they kept wickman and millitello in their rotation which is much nicer than that kaminiecki and mike witt combo i thought theyd throw out their to the slaughterhouse because of their experience granted witt might be good but i think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience   the yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards the jays with the loss of dave stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their pitching staff   the orioles should also be there in the end  gord niguma to salvage the season let jj olerud win mvp

   at age 00 alomar had a brilliant rookie year  true he was limited by injuries in his sophomore season but his numbers both that yaer and the year following were quite mediocre  this season the same bill james projects a ba of 000 ops of 000    the same bill james why do you say that it sounds like youre suggesting  bill james had something to do with overhyping the kid to death au contraire he was fairly critical of him after his roy campaign noting that he wasnt allworld as a catcher or a hitter he called him basically average when everyone else in the media was predicting the next johnny bench or roy campanella   both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers expected to be among the best ever in baseball  the reports i read indicate that lopez is very ordinary defensively    which reports are those   the dodgers options are parrish and hernandez and now only carlos piazza is 00  as long as he continues with his very hot bat they will keep him in the lineup because they need the offensive production  when he cools off look for the much better defensive catcher hernandez only 00 to play more    i like hernandez a lot but if piazza can catch the ball youve gotta play him imho hes a much better hitter although hernandez isnt a bad hitter right now it sounds like piazza will catch most of the time and hernandez will be candiottis caddy since he can catch the knuckler as long as they play up to their abilities the dodgers could have a very good catching tandem    the braves options are berryhill and olson  i agree that olson is nothing special but i do think berryhill is better than many  people on rsb believe  but both the braves catchers are very good defensively calling a game blocking the plate throwing and although they are somewhat weak offenivsively they play on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat    i think both are overrated defensively see nichols law of catcher defense but thats something thats difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine about the only tangible thing we can look at is opponents sb and thats clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners catchers era is a possibility but its subject to way too many biases     as for them playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat i disagree here too about the only chink in the braves armor is that theyre weak offensively at several positions cf c 0b ss if belliard plays 0b unless bream and hunter form another superplatoon and very weak  defensively if blauser plays id like to see the braves give at least one of mel nieves javy lopez or chipper jones a shot but much like the talentrich jays of recent years theyll be conservative and stick with what they have  im not saying thats wrong just conservative      dave hung like a jim acker slider kirsch      blue jays  do it again in 00  kirschstafftcumnedu                        new  quotes out of context not to beat a dead horse but its been a couple o weeks  this   disappoints mepunishmentsdischargesjackhammering  stephen lawrence

  usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season but the past few seasons have been incredible any thoughts on the new old reds uniforms  i remember seeing a pete rose rookie card and unless i miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds   the mets how about docs performance today have reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder and changed the mets insgnia on the front of the jersey  to my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 0000 and it reminds me a little of the dodger logo   many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform or at least uniforms that look more traditional phillies reds expos white sox padres etc and the once bright colors have been altered to gray  the trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years as opposed to the cookiecutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs no one in the comissioners office and interleague play on the horizon its nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be

  i just wanted to let everyone know that i have lost what little respect i have for jim lefebvre after seeing todays cubs game first of all how could he start maldonado over may after the way may played at the end of last year and the way he tore up the cactus league how could you let him sit the bench not to mention that a right hander maddux started i really blew my top when lefebvre pinch hit for rick wilkins with tommy shields how can you do that just because of the leftyrighty thing too much is made of that wilkins is twice the hitter that shields is then the next batter was jose vizcaino one of the weakest hitters i have ever seen and who had looked terrible at bat all day and lefebre let him hit while may still sat the bench i think even arnie harris was stunned by this because he showed may sitting in the dugout while vizcaino was batting face it lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in baseball a dishard cub fan

  is there any doubt that this is true  after a few down years the al east is back to where it was in the early eighties  with the emergence of the os and the yanks it is far and away the best  while the nl west has the best team in baseball and the reds arent bad either they have nothing else  the giants astros and padres all have talent they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the al east  and the dodgers just plain suck  as for the rockies who knows    the al east has the defending champs and although they lost a lot to free agency toronto is still one of the best in baseball  the orioles have the preseason favorite to win the cy young in mike mussina and you can never forget about ripken  the signings of harold baines and harold reynolds dont hurt to much either although i always liked bill ripken  while they let a lot go this summer randy milligan joe orsulak bill ripken bob milacki sam horn storm davis and craig lefferts they kept the heart of their team intact  my predicted finish 0 baltimore could be a biased opinion 0 ny yankees 0 toronto 0 milwaukee 0 detroit 0 boston 0 cleveland would have been higher if not for the accident  go os    
  briefly since im off to sleep  mles work pretty well for aa nd aaa players  players who are 00 and younger will tend to have explosions  in their numbers whether mmles or not in the next 0 years  players who are 00 and older at those levels generally have  inflated mles  theyre about as reliable as having major league stats for a player     bob gaj

  sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases  what competition did  alomar have  sandberg came in a year after ripken and the same year as boggs gwynn and the other magicians  so less attention was given to sandberg  alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre  besides the  numbers dont count  national league pitchers are much better pitchers   youre right thomas gonzalez sheffield and griffey dont even begin to compare with ripken boggs and gwynn so no wonder alomar gets so much attention  sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was terrible  so was his sophomore year  national league pitchers are much better pitchers  that certainly explains sheffields 0000 hm  are you confusing have eras that are 000 lower because they dont face dhs with much better   ted frank                  however teel should have mentioned that though  thf0kimbarkuchicagoedu   his advice is legally sound if you follow it  the u of c law school       you will probably wind up in jail standard disclaimers                           james donald in misclegal  
  i was watching peter gammons on espn last night and hes got me a little confused  while talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit from the fringe players theyll be facing mcgriff hitting 00 home runs sheffield getting 000 rbis and glavine winning 00 games  this was of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball has expanded early 00s late 00s late 00s  what really confused me though was the mention of al players who would do well next year  specifically roger clemens winning 00 games and the likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting 00 home runs  my question is  how in the hell will the rockiesmarlins help the al  the last time i looked there wasnt a lot of talent jumping leagues  did i miss something  only if you persist in believing that peter gammons is more knowledgable about baseball than the average mailbox  okay im overstating  still the man  actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the nl this year did not pitch in the majors last year  huh  imo this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the  other expansion drafts had since the talent was diluted over both leagues in gammons defense because the talent drain came from the al as well some increase will be seen  he also gets credit for mentioning that the 0000 jump in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 0000 season  hes still full of it                 kurt bose as in daisy not rose  kboscarinaunmedu if you take out all the fks this is an 00 page book    wally backman leafing though a copy of mets teammate lenny dykstras      autobiography nails

000  000      maj       000  000  00   0  00   00   00  00    this is what jackson looked like in 0000 with everything converted  to a neutral park on the basis of run production his equivalent  average started at 000 in 00 was up to 000 in 00 and 000 in 00 so  let us say he had established in his last two seasons a 000 level  of play  im not quite sure how these numbers are generated  it appears that in a neutral park bos hr and slugging tend to drop he actually loses two home runs  or do they  what is equivalent average  one thing when looking at bos stats is that you can see that kc took away some homers  normally you expect some wouldbe homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks or to be caught and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway  but bo despite his speed  hit very few doubles and not that many triples  so i would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park     that is good very good in fact but it probably doesnt make the top  ten in the league the 00th best eqa in the al in 0000 was dave  winfields 000 thomas was first at 000 first in the nl was bonds  an incroyable 000 tenth was bip roberts 000 but 000 is better  than any season in the past five years by joe carter it is about what  mattingly had in 0000 000 what felix jose had the last two years  just ahead of time raines fiveyear average better than ryan  kleskos mles   felix jose has been a 000000 player in a fairly neutral park i would offhand guess the 0000 bo at around a 000000 player maybe 000000   not even close   he got more attention from the media than was warranted from his  baseball playing though his hype was a lot better than his hitting  that is the basis for the netcomments about him being overrated the  media would have you beleive he was a great hitter i think he was a  good maybe very good hitter he was imo something like the 00th best  hitter in the majors  id put him about there too    note i hadnt realized the media had hyped him so much  i thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player and only soso  at baseball  he did only have one 00hr 000rbi season and kc wasnt winning  note 0 i maybe have harped on this a bit in the past but there is a mistake being made by the sdcns as they are known on this group with respect to players like bo and deion and lofton and perhaps others  we find that if you look at a large group of players their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well their are some caveats the younger they are the less good the prediction the lower the minor league the less good i imagine the more recent the player has left college ball etc  now of course this prediction involves quite a bit of error  sometimes a player with poor mles dave justice the 0000 ventura becomes a star some hitters develop shane mack brian downing some dont oddibe mcdowell mickey brantley  this error involves real things there are real reasons why oddibe didnt hit and shane did  it may who knows involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on  but still you have this big pool of players and things work pretty well one of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players  one thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them or almost all have spent a good deal of time playing ball  their backgrounds are similar  what hasnt been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background  is there some reason to believe that a bo or a deion or a lofton or a tony gwynn  or an ainge or so on has such a different background that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly  it hasnt been established that you can use mles with twosport players it hasnt been established that you cant but then statistics is after all an art  i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about bo and deion and lofton look at those goodbutnotgreat minor league numbers they say  well what happens if those numbers simply dont mean what they usually mean it might mean that ken lofton suddenly has a better year in houston than tuscon  it might mean that deion suddenly has a better halfyear in atlanta than greenville    then again it might not  ken and deion might go right back in the tank this year live up to those poor mles  but you guys dont know  whats  worse you dont know that you dont  and you dont know that there are  other players you wont know about  injuries and lifting and wheaties  again  you seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal  its not its got some error  oh well  bill guilford  still thinks hairy butt is truly ugly might be right

  ian odom writes as far as i know toronto pittsburgh and new york nl change their uniforms every year  every other year eg new york it will say mets in cursive new york in cursive or new york in all caps  minor changes but they do change them often  last year i think they had new york in all caps  did toronto have blue jays or toronto last year  what about pittsburgh        it depends on which uniforms you are talking about  for the last couple of years i believe toronto and pittsburgh has used the same uniforms or at least very similar  the home jerseys had the team nick name blue jays or pirates but the road jerseys had the name of the city toronto or pittsburgh  i believe this is the way most teams design their uniforms      chris

  mssnetcomcom mark singer said  we know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball    yes  but this is irrelevant  youre talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on  i might as well say we know that very very few people are more than 0 feet tall so chances are that manute bol is really only 0 foot 0  no  maybe i need to improve my writing skills  lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age 00 having not played at aaa level that it is probably not a good idea to rush him into the braves lineup in 0000  why isnt lopez likely to hit that well  he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did  by a lot  as for rushing  if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i dont believe there is then wouldnt you rather waste lopezs 00year old good season than his 00year old very good season or his 00yearold excellent season  the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use  lopez was hitting 000 over 00 ab when he was cut from spring training  what does he have to do to earn a chance  maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth  gee  i dont know  00 abs sounds pretty good to me  about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a backup role rather than start every day at aaa  talk about me as a gm  the point was not that 00 ab is a significant sample but rather that he hadnt done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up  ok  most players are not ready for the bigs at age 00   most players are never ready for the bigs  what does this have to do with javy lopez  most players  benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa  see above    most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs  those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year  but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds  most players arent that good so they probably wont be that good this year either  now  the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners    and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble  not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans  not superstars not stars not even good players  maybe average if were being charitable  the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops    ummm  justice is a very fine hitter  pendleton might have another big year in his bat but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell  gant is a big question mark  the breamhunter platoon is decent not excellent and has rotten obp or slg depending on whos in  blauser is a very valuable bat for a shortstop   the center field platoon will probably hit 000  however good lopez bat might be given the above it wont be so much better than what they have to offset the differential in experience and  defensive ability    wanna bet  the difference between lopezs bat and olsonberryhill could be 00 or 00 runs over the course of the season  given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play ill take the latter every time  the kid will improve playing at aaa   just like keith mitchell did  i am just so surprised i have to spell all of this out  my  goodness  do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential  that was me and you so far your only counterproposal is that they really dont understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two  i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization  are they idiots who have built this ballclub    wellargued but inflammatory reply deleted       david m tate     i do not know what it is about you that closes   posing as        and opens only something in me understands    e e can         the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete roses      dy cummings   nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands  
  mssnetcomcom mark singer said in article 0000bluecispittedu geneticpittedu david m tate writes  well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there  but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion    catcher is their weakest position with the possible exception of second base they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a wellaboveaverage offensive player and acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team and they want to play olson and berryhill instead  i disagree in that i dont think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership is  i dont deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but i really dont see any way that we could ever know who they are  nicholss law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously  sorry  new  dont know nichols law    a catchers defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his  recent offensive level of performance  thus mickey tettleton goes in  the media from being a nohit defensive whiz to a slugging thumbfinger  in two short years  the rule doesnt apply to perceived superstars who  get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead  greg olson is probably  considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he cant hit   dont believe in catchers era  but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers  arent they the same thing  in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind  a different decision than we would make must be financial    either that or just stupidity  i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no  of course  is it fair to the young players  no  does it make organizational sense  i think it does  well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions  i mean please dont tell me how to run my business  especially when im being successful  one could make the same sort of argument in other cases  pete rose in pursuing ty cobbs record was a huge gate attraction and national media magnet  the reds made a lot of money off that they also wasted the prime of eric davis  that may be good business but that doesnt mean i dont loathe them for it        david m tate     i do not know what it is about you that closes   posing as        and opens only something in me understands    e e can         the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete roses      dy cummings   nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands

     whenever a person is put on the 00day 00day or 00day   the person is on the list longer than the specificed time    ive seen a person on the 00day for maybe 0 months last year i dont  remember what   i just need a little clarification on the disabled list specifications  i believe we are down to two  the 00day and the 00day  i dont remember  a 00day but rather a 00day  anyways its gone now  the period length  is a minimum not a maximum  you can keep a guy on the 00day for as long  as you want if hes still certified as injured  the player must be  periodically reevaluated to determine if hes still injured thus you  cannot park a player on the dl who maybe is out of options and you do not  wish to expose to waivers  if you get someone qualified for the 00day  that reduces the frequency of reevaluations  there is no longer i  believe any limit to the number of players you can place on the dl  when  there was you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between  the lists king sparky banaianno taxes  no new taxes kbanaianpitzerclaremonteduno old taxes we are taxed dept of economics pitzer collegeenough  rep alan keyes latest 0000 gdp forecast  00 please run alan

  mssnetcomcom mark singer said  we know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball    yes  but this is irrelevant  youre talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on  do you really have that much information on him  really  why isnt lopez likely to hit that well  he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did  by a lot  i dont know  you tell me  what percentage of players reach or  exceed their mles in their rookie season  were talking about 0000 you know   as for rushing  if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i dont believe there is then wouldnt you rather waste lopezs 00year old good season than his 00year old very good season or his 00yearold excellent season  the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use  if that were your purpose maybe  offerman spent 0000 getting  acclimated if you will  the dodgers as a team paid a big price that season  perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road do you really think they would have done what they did if they were competing for a pennant   lopez was hitting 000 over 00 ab when he was cut from spring training  what does he have to do to earn a chance  maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth  the point was not that 00 ab is a significant sample but rather that he hadnt done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up  for a stathead im amazed that you put any credence in spring training  did you notice who he got those 00  hits off of or are you going to tell me that it doesnt make a difference  the kid will improve playing at aaa   just like keith mitchell did  wait a minute  i missed something here  first forget keith mitchell  are you saying that a kid who moves from aa to aaa and then does not improve would have been better off making a direct leap to the majors  if a player does well at aa and then does not improve at aaa isnt that a sign that maybe he doesnt belong in the bigs  now keith mitchell  as i recall no stat books handy  surprise he jumped from aa to atlanta in 0000  he did so well that he was returned to the minors where he didnt do very well at all  now his career is in jeopardy  so how does he fit in with your  point  good mles in aa  moved him right to the big club  now hes one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball duh   that was me and you so far your only counterproposal is that they really dont understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two  i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization  well ive cast my lot  certainly you may understand better how  good lopez is  and i may overvalue experience  but neither one of us runs a baseball team    the beastmaster     mark singer     mssnetcomcom

   your speculation and  others that lopez will produce better than the two proven veterans is nothing more than speculation no matter how well founded  your speculation that the two proven veterans will produce better than lopez is also no more than speculation  it does make a difference whether the speculation is wellfounded or not    obviously the braves believe they can win with the catching they have and i agree  if they change their minds theyll call up lopez  though this is a good point  the one speculation is safer because it can be reversed  cheers valentine

  since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx 00 posts going back to the braves could be better off if an injury happens i may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame  0  back at the beginning of spring training i though lopez would make the squad easily  olson was still recovering from his lateseason injury knee i believe and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before june  and then berryhill was dinged up  i was looking forward to this because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position  before last season he was the braves defensive catcher prospect while brian deak was the braves offensive catcher prospect  besides olson and berryhill couldnt hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and dont walk enough to be useful  but olson recovered quickly berryhill recovered and the braves went with the two vets  i still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season he wouldnt have gotten his job back  0  there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around after all ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear  there are teams out there without one average ml catcher california and seattle come to mind  certainly trying to move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work plus youd have to eat that salary which isnt huge but isnt tiddleywinks either i think olsons at about 000000 berryhill at 000000 but thats only what i recall  0  yes i think arbitrationeligibility may have a role to play in this also  what is it that 00 of the 0year players arent eligible for arbitration   only the 00 that were on the roster the longest are eligible  of course the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet known  from a business standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until junethe first time olsonberryhill go on the dl  0  i am still disappointed that lopez isnt on the team i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves and the truth is that id rather see our best team on the field which imo includes lopez  of coursetoday we play the cubs  hopefully we wont need him   as for the schuerholzcox conversation i imagine it went like this  remember theyve both been gms the following is not meant to be read by the humorimpaired  cox  ok weve sent jones down  his fielding could be a little smoother  besides blauser can hit ok and his fielding is better than it used to be  schuerholz  well well have to send nieves down too  deion just wont sign that baseball only contract  we cant count on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the defense  besides gormans not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet  once hatchers gone and deion signs we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez  that ought to give us some pitching depth in 0000  cox  yep thatll be nice  too bad deion wont sign ok ill look for nieves when justice starts having berryberryer back problems again  now what about klesko  schuerholz  well weve still got to fork out another 00 mil for bream  if we keep klesko we either lose the money or cabrera  i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he doesnt seem to be the same gm  first jeffries for jose and now whiten for clark  if he gets rid of brian jordan then id have to believe that he and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings  cox  ok keep trying on bream and ill wait til the trading deadline for my hunterklesko platoon  maybe i can get a few extra atbats for cabrera while we wait  try california if snow starts slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid and if that doesnt work then perhaps sids knees could be persuaded to act up  theres always the 00day dl  mwahahahaha  schuerholz  what about caraballo  cox  well hes not that much better than lemke  maybe if he starts in richmond hell start walking more  besides if hes going to be arbitrationeligible better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks  schuerholz  now lets see  that leaves lopez  cox  nooooo  i gotta keep lopez  sure i didnt think olson would recover this quickly  maybe i can talk caminiti into running into him again  schuerholz  nope lopez has gotta go  you know that hell get 0 million in arbitration  may as well put it off that one extra year  besides until olsons shown his stuff a little bit i cant trade him  besides berryhills a lefthanded hitter  you know how rare that is  cox  dont you mean a lefthanded whiffer  pretty common if you ask me  i mean he made pat borders look good in the world series  pat borders  schuerholz  hey youre the one who wouldnt write lopez into the lineup  cox  well youre the one who went out and got me jeff reardon  besides i thought lopez wouldnt be used to our pitching staffs stuff  he got some time with them this springlooked pretty good  come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate  schuerholz  yeah but which stiff  whichever one we keep will be hurt by may  cox  ok ok you made your point  keep them both  surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest  then i can call up lopez and then we can win 000 games  the pennant the world series  ill be up there with john mcgraw  casey stengel  earl weaver  oh they laughed at me in toronto but have you ever had to deal with george bell  ill finally get my just reward  mwahahaha  schuerholz  easy bobby  have you been taking those happy pills left around by chuck tanner  whyd you ever hire that guy anyhow  cox  dont ask me ask ted   eric

  from iacs0000oswegoedu kevin mundstock subject joe robbie stadium not for baseball date 0 apr 00 000000 gmt did anyone notice the words not for baseball printed on the picture of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa today any reason given for this   i would assume that the words i saw the picture indicated that those  seats will not be available for baseball games  if you look at the picture  of the diamond in the stadium in relation to the areas marked not for  baseball those seats just look terrible for watching baseball   now if  they should happen to reach the postseason i would imagine that they  would consider opening some of those seats up but that is surely a worry  of the future      sam lubchansky          spl0pocwruedu  in the champion people see what theyd like to be  in the loser  they see what they actually are and they treat him with scorn  sugary condiments secure initial pleasure but fermented grain is  decidedly more parsimonious of time   
   speaking of the marlins winning the opener    based on lifetime percentage of games won who has the second best   record  in baseball history soon to be the best record again      if i had to guess i would be forced to say the yankees  on the other   hand  the blue jays might be up there too    hmmmmm    tony  blue jays no way hell but the yankees probably do remember the yankees   had the best record of any team in the 00s and probably take the 00s   through 00s as well  
  jason walter works writes      the nyyankees are now one game closer to the aleast pennant    they   clobbered cleveland 00 on a fine pitching performance by key and two   homeruns by tartabullfirst mlbaseball to go out this season and a   three   run homer by nokes  for all of you who didnt pick boggs in your pools   tough break he had a couple hits and drove in a couple runswith many   more   to follow  the yanks beat an up and coming team of youngsters in the   indians  the yankees only need to win 00 more games to get the   division   go yanks mattingly for gglove and mvp and abbot for cy young                                                  jason  jason i am going to a yankee game wed night at cleveland stadium i am so   happy   but cleveland is a very bad team who lost severalrs they were an up and   coming team now they are just a sad excuse for a better average    abbot will not win the cy melido perez will as bold a prediction   as they come well herot be in last place by the end of the season mike   lurie speaks and the world listens  
   do you realize that the yankees are paying matt nokes 0000000 dollars   this year geesh and maas only gets 000000        by the way the yankees are going to win it all   yankees are the best    by the way jt snow an exyankee will be rookie of the year  
  kevin mundstock writes  did anyone notice the words not for baseball printed on the picture  of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa  today any reason given for this    yes and the answer is simple to create a better feeling in the park the    seats will be folded back for baseball games where you saw those words  
  how many runs will be scored in denver i dont know  but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in  mile high stadium during the last few years of the bearszephyrs  tenure in the american association  heres the total runs scored per game in zephyrs games  all league games and the ratio i found the same ratios for hr  year  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio    0000 0000  000 000   000 000 000 0000  000  000 000   000 000 000 0000 0000  000 000   000 000 000 0000  000  000 000   000 000 000 0000  000  000 000   000 000 000 0000 0000 0000 000   000 000 000 0000  000  000 000   000 000  00 0000  000  000 000   000 000 000 0000  000  000 000   000 000  00 0000 0000  000 000   000 000 000 0000 0000 0000 000   000 000 000 0000 0000  000 000   000 000  00 0000 0000  000 000   000 000 000       000000000     000000000  it seems pretty clear that denver will have a large effect  on runs scored ill stick with my prediction from last year  that itll be one of the top 0 in the nl this year  and a fairly large effect on homeruns  though apparently not as large as  atlanta wrigley cincinnati and san diego still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park  john rickert rickertnextworkrosehulmanedu

  look at all that teal  bleah  indeed if the color teal on a teams uniforms is any indication of the future the marlins are in dire trouble refer to the san jose sharks for proof but i have hope for the marlins i was a sometime member of the rene lachemann fan club at the oakland coliseum and have a deep respect for the guy hes a gem and of course walt weiss gives that franchise class but yeah whoever designed those uniforms was guilty of a paucity of style and imagination ugghhh  maybe im just a child of the 00s but i really liked the marlins uniforms the helmets shine nicely in the sun  its enough to make me a fan   ted frank                  however teel should have mentioned that though  thf0kimbarkuchicagoedu   his advice is legally sound if you follow it  the u of c law school       you will probably wind up in jail standard disclaimers                           james donald in misclegal

  mssnetcomcom mark singer said in article 0000bluecispittedu geneticpittedu david m tate writes mssnetcomcom mark singer said  we know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball    yes  but this is irrelevant  youre talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on  do you really have that much information on him  really  i dont personally but clay just posted it  yes we do    unfortunately it shows that lopez wasnt as good an example as nieves would have been since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous years which i didnt have access to  the point remains though knowing a guys minor league history is as good as knowing his major league history if you know how to read it  why isnt lopez likely to hit that well  he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did  by a lot  i dont know  you tell me  what percentage of players reach or  exceed their mles in their rookie season  were talking about 0000 you know  the mle is not a projection its an equivalence  its a this is how well he hit last year in major league terms rating  so in essence he has already reached it  i would guess bob  clay that essentially half of all players surpass their previous mles in their rookie seasons  maybe more than half since all of these players are young and improving  if that were your purpose maybe  offerman spent 0000 getting  acclimated if you will  the dodgers as a team paid a big price that season    did they  offerman may have been the difference between 0th or 0th place and last place but no more  perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road do you really think they would have done what they did if they were competing for a pennant  sure they didnt have anyone better  i suppose they might have gutted the farm system to acquire jay bell or spike owen or somebody if they were really in contention   the point was not that 00 ab is a significant sample but rather that he hadnt done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up  for a stathead im amazed that you put any credence in spring training    if youd read what i wrote youd be less amazed  nowhere do i claim to put any credence in spring training  quite the contrary i said that lopez hadnt done anything that even the bozos who do put credence in spring training could interpret as failure  just because i think spring training numbers are meaningless doesnt mean that bobby cox does its just a case of ruling out one possible explanation for sending lopez down  the kid will improve playing at aaa   just like keith mitchell did  wait a minute  i missed something here    keith mitchell did very very well at aa aaa and the majors over a season then did very very poorly for a year in aaa       david m tate     i do not know what it is about you that closes   posing as        and opens only something in me understands    e e can         the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete roses      dy cummings   nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands

  most of this discussion has been between mark singer and david tate with valentine weighing in on the same side as dave at various times my opinion fwiw to all  mark age doesnt matter ability does i would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best i dont care if he is 00 if he plays better than what i have i want him out there sandy alomar had decent minor league numbers grossly inflated by the pcl in general and las vegas in particular he should have been projected as an average major league hitter which is good for a catcher ill admit santiagos numbers would probably come out the same as sandys but i dont have the league data from the mid00s to check it out  that being said i agree with sending lopez to richmond at least to start the season as the box below shows he has one minor league season in which he hit well he has two in which he hit very very poorly i want to see that the 00 lopez is real olson and berryhill are not complete mediocrities for catchers especially nl catchers they are essentially average hitters with equivalent averages around 000 if he had hit well at prior levels i would say he belongs on the braves but there is a reasonable chance that lopez last year was just as much a fluke as alomar in 00 or santiago in 00 one year at any level at any age doesnt satisfy my standards of evidence      javier lopez 0000            0000 bur    000  000  00   0   0    0    0   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 dur    000   00   0   0   0   00    0   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 grn    000  000  00   0  00   00    0   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 atl     00    0   0   0   0    0    0   0  000    0  000  000  000     maj        00    0   0   0   0    0    0   0  000    0  000  000  000     min      0000  000  00   0  00   00   00   0  000  000  000  000  000     tot      0000  000  00   0  00   00   00   0  000  000  000  000  000     maj       000  000  00   0   0    0    0   0     min       000  000  00   0  00   00    0   0     tot       000  000  00   0  00   00    0   0  on a similar note i dont understand why more people are not supportive of neon deion granted i thought his behavior with mccarver last year was completely bush last year was the first time he ever got 000 ab in one place so his lines are hard to read but he has a combined 000 ops in minor league play with his speed is more valuable than the ops alone indicates and at a still young age 00 had a monster year with an 000 ops he has a total major and minor eqa of 000 above major league average and above average for cf which was about 000 in the nl last year he has shown at least the potential of going into the 000s which would make him one of the 00 best hitters in the league he has two full seasons before reaching his prime season of 00 he should be considered as a legitimate prospect and not as a simple sideshow attraction        deion sanders 0000         0000 fla     00    0   0   0   0    0    0   0  000    0  000  000  000   0000 int     00    0   0   0   0    0    0   0  000    0  000  000  000   0000 eas    000   00   0   0   0    0   00   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 nyy     00   00   0   0   0    0    0   0  000    0  000  000  000   0000 int    000   00  00   0   0   00   00   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 nyy    000   00   0   0   0   00    0   0  000    0  000  000  000   0000 int     00   00   0   0   0   00    0   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 atl    000   00   0   0   0   00   00   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 ric    000   00   0   0   0    0   00   0  000   00  000  000  000   0000 atl    000   00  00  00  00   00   00   0  000   00  000  000  000     maj       000  000  00  00  00   00   00  00  000   00  000  000  000     min       000  000  00   0  00   00   00  00  000   00  000  000  000     tot      0000  000  00  00  00  000   00  00  000  000  000  000  000     maj       000  000  00  00  00   00   00  00     min       000  000  00   0  00   00   00  00     tot       000  000  00  00  00   00   00  00  clay d

  did anyone notice the words not for baseball printed on the picture of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa today any reason given for this  also i just noticed something looking at the nolan ryan timeline in the preview on 00000 rickey henderson became nolans 0000th strikeout on 00000 he pitched his 0th nohitter against oakland i believe the last out in the game was made by rickey henderson and on 0000 nolan pitched his 0th nohitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 000th base which overshadowed it it seems that nolan is having a lot of publicity at rickeys expense imo rickey deserves it and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what ive seen on it lately they are both great players but imo nolan has outclassed rickey both in playing and more importantly in attitude just my thoughts  kevin  
  as for rushing  if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i dont believe there is then wouldnt you rather waste lopezs 00year old good season than his 00year old very good season or his 00yearold excellent season  the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use  can anybody name a player who was rushed to the majors lets for arguments sake define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 00 or younger and performing below expectations whose career was damaged by this rushing  im serious i tend to agree with david that bringing the player up sooner is better but id like to look at players for whom this theory didnt work if there are any  id prefer players within the last 00 years or so because then i can look up their minor league stats  its important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected as opposed to players who were hyped and failed but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers    lets kick it off with an example of a player who was rushed although there doesnt seem to have been any damage to his career  jay bell was given 000 pas in the major leagues at age 00 and performed well below what you would expect from his aaa numbers the same season  he got 000 pas the next year at age 00 and still underperformed  however the next year at age 00 his performance improved and he won the everyday shortstop job and has been there ever since  its really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league where he was performed quite well in aaa during this time rather than being rushed cleveland might have been better off i suppose because they might have been less likely to give up on him  yes if you bring a player up early hes likely going to struggle  but does that delay the time at which he stops struggling and starts performing up to expectations  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

  snicholsadobecom sherri nichols writes  can anybody name a player who was rushed to the majors lets for arguments sake define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 00 or younger and performing below expectations whose career was damaged by this rushing   i tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues the braves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis as they had little talent on their roster for some time  steve avery for example was rushed to the majors and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign his subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 0 era during his rookie year  bill james pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound  bob horner was also rushed to the majors out of arizona state directly had good numbers immediately  i am not certain of the ages of people like pete smith craig mcmurty and derek lilliquist  the braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed  lilliquist and smith struggled but it didnt hurt ps and dl may have been overhyped  i seem to recall cm pitching well initially though i dont have stats handy  douglas boneinternet bonelucianostanfordedu standard disclaimersbitnet   bonelucianostanfordedustanford applyuucp   ucbvaxlucianosierrastanfordedubone  
  stay in school  you have a lot to learn  learn what  i know that 0 million dollars is a lot of money  i know  rickey henderson doesnt have a career out of baseball  i know if he  didnt have baseball he wouldnt be making near the money he is now  i just dont understand how some athlete who only plays a sport for a  living for millions of dollars say he is not being paid enough  if nobody will sign him for his asking price he will be the one hurting the as will still win without him  remeber many of these athletes have nothing if not for their athletic  ability  nothing  they are getting paid much more than most hard working citizens and they are complaining of not enough pay  i dont have a problem with them making millions  my problem is when the say they arent being paid enough when they already get 0 millionalso their numbers get worse

  mssnetcomcom mark singer said   most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs  those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year  now  the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners    this is the crux of the argument to me at least  both the sdcn and the nonsdcn camps seem to agree on the fact that a catchers defense is basically nonmeasurable at present  you can talk about how important calling a game is or framing the pitches or blocking balls in the dirt  but there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catchers rank in defense    looking at lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the braves or the media has labeled him a bad defensive catcher  as far as i can tell he doesnt have any particular problem in his mechanics such as sasser  he might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time  i cant see how repetitions at aaa are any better then reps in the majors    all were left with is the calling the game aspect  olsen  and berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff  but this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers  how is catching at aaa going to help lopez learn the major league pitching staff  the only way any catcher is going to learn tom glavines pitches is to catch tom glavine  similarly i wouldnt be supprised if the pitchers claimed to prefer pitching to olsen over pitching to lopez because they are used to pitching to olsen  but  given time they will say they are comfortable with lopez  now since lopez cant learn how to handle the major league pitchers while hes in aaa and since he doesnt have any glaring problem in his mechanics what is he going to learn in aaa that he cant learn just as well while in the majors    dave  dave bonar mebonarlsuvaxsncclsuedu

  now keith mitchell  as i recall no stat books handy  surprise he jumped from aa to atlanta in 0000  he did so well that he was returned to the minors where he didnt do very well at all  now his career is in jeopardy  so how does he fit in with your  point  good mles in aa  moved him right to the big club  now hes one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball duh  methinks you recall wrong mitchell hit close to 000 in atlanta and  continued to walk alot after his promotion he was then i think left off the playoff roster and started the next year in the minors where even the braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad at going back down   he struggled last year no doubt but even the braves blamed part of it on the demotion id much rather have mitchell than say mark whiten on the cards     russ smith  i dont know anything about xs but i know about some o                                 george gervin on being an assistant coach

   i was watching the dodgersmarlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me    first is that the way the sun was shining in miami it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball  in comparison wrigley field in early april still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans    the second and most important was the fans  i like these guysgals i will admit i am a football fan first but i still enjoy baseball it was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the miami dolphins  the way they were cheering i thought it was the afc playoffs  of course opening day may have a lot to do with it but i really got feeling of electricity that i think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities    baseball certainly needs a charge and i hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement  well find out friday how denver bronco fans respond   phillies are 00 i better say it now before my opportunity passes by  
   i personally will never forget mike schmidts home run against the expos in 0000 that decided the nl east  it was also his career high 00th   another home run that i thought was totally incredible was in the 0000 alcs  the ca angles had the boston red sox 0 strike away from the pennant until don baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run that was the most incredible turn of events i have ever seen in baseball  the sox later took the pennant away only to have the same thing done to them in the ws against the mets  speaking of the mets isnt it strange how the nlcs that year with the astros almost mirrored the 0000 nlcs with the phillies  the astros have been painfully close twice i must admit    
   this talk about the phillies winning the nl east is scary  very scary  dont get me wrong im a phillies fan but as late as last year they looked helpless  the funny thing was they did have a lot of injuries in 00 spring training that basically killed their chances  of course dont forget the dykstra wrist injury in the first or second game     
   after reading my local paper today i found out that the phillies started the 0000 season at 000  i am not as old as 0000 but ive heard many talk about the serious choke job the phillies did that season they were ahead of the cardinals by 00 games that season in midaugust  they managed to lose a bunch from then on and the cardinals took the division  00 games ahead and lost it i hope this season is much different

   in article 0000adobecom snicholsadobecom sherri nichols writes every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball being 00 offense 00 defense  a run scored is just as important as a run prevented     this certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any  statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what  percent is fielding  id really like to know  btw sherri thanks for   the da data i find it fascinating  of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented just as a penny saved is a penny earned  enough with the cliches my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to their potential they wont need much offensive support i realize this is a big if  this staff leaves the 00 bosox in the dust there is no legitimate comparison  two cy young winners and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter  it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs  the team that scores the most  runs wins  this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs  a low  scoring game would clearly benefit the braves  they should have many  low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting on the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers they would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent  the name of the games is to win  even ray knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard all im trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the braves have the offense doesnt need to be as strong   sam    dave     sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

   weird thing  leading 000 going into the top of the ninth sparky       used his ace closer henneman  the tigers have 0 relievers       and at least 0 were restedavailable  does sparky trust       them that little   i think he just wanted to get henneman some work because the  tigers had days off both the day before and the day after  jim  
    does that mean they have to pay his salary  didnt they wait  for him to clear waivers  if not why not  davis will be paid by three clubs this year i think the phils are responsbible for about 000000 or so  they didnt wait for him to clear waivers as three other clubs were also very interested in him  a gamble yes   oh it will  as a royals fan i am skeptical  they say he pitched well  in winter ball  he also pitched well at omaha while with kc  he just  didnt pitch well or even acceptably when in the majors  i dont have  his atlanta stats but he must not have impressed them very much either  what about the year when he got 00 saves in san diego did he pitch well then  ok i know he was awful the next year when he went to kc but still  won the cy young too for that year    
  m derby writes  this talk about the phillies winning the nl east is scary  very scary  dont get me wrong im a phillies fan but as late as last year they looked helpless  the funny thing was they did have a lot of injuries in 00 spring training that basically killed their chances  of course dont forget the dykstra wrist injury in the first or second game  first game first at bat    
  didnt bob horner go straight from arizona state univ to the atlanta braves i remember he had one great month hitting dingers and then the next i heard he was in japan  a month  well he did have a short careercompared to what one might have expected for such a highly touted prospectdue to being injury prone overweight and having no work ethic  but he certainly did not suffer from being rushed to the bigs   len reed holos software inc voice 000 0000000 ext 00 domain lbrholosatlgausa   uucp lbrholos0uucp

  says  what i think is hotdogish about his abs is the way he leans out over the plate to watch outside pitches etc this not done to get a better look at the pitch but to make it seemthis ball is so far out i need to lean just to get near it so you better call it a ball this is my unbiased opinion of what i see your mileage will vary rickey is agreat player to watch if you forget who he is at the time  a lot of batters lean in when pitches come  rickeys crouch tends to exaggerate that i think  a great player to watch if you forget who he is  unbiased hmmm  bob vesterman

  rogers is the onebatter lefty in the bullpen  dusty has also said he trusts rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where beck is unavailable so you might see a couple of saves for kevin  then again if any of the regular rotation falters rogers is a possible candidate to start though this would appear less likely now that dave burba did well in an emergency start  steven  
  joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball  for anyone who didnt see sundays game  with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers  later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a 000 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea a 000 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  what the hell is he thinking  earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said he liked gilkey coming off the bench  gilkey hit over 000 last year what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every team in the league  furthermore in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate  the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home   i cant take this anymore  brian a very distressed cardinal fan    brian landmann                                             georgia institute of technology                            internetgt0000aprismgatechedu

mcgwire will hit 00 or more hrs this year  nope  he slowed down and the injury finished him off  didnt even reach 00  but a ballsy prediction nonetheless    from ecaxronmarslercnasagov thu may 00 000000 0000 0 baltimore will not fade  they will not win the division this year     but they will finish within five games  i find the prospect of two     orioles winning 00 each easier to comprehend than that of two sox     no offense  i think their pitching is about as good as the division     has to offer  the orioles finished seven games out  none of them won 00 though mussina might have had a chance with better relief and more starts  0 nobody else in the division is worth a darn  they all finish a minimum     of fifteen games out the tribe 00  thats another reason to watch     baltimore this year and next  they wont waste many of those games      against the rest of the division  except for the brewers who you probably forgot you were right  the rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre  the yankees and indians led with 00 wins the red sox trailed with 00 wins  none were horrible but four were five or more games below 000   date thu 0 aug 0000 000000 gmt  right  that was me  i never said the jays were a cinch to clinch it but i said that milwaukee will be more of a threat than baltimore  i do think that toronto should win it but after 00 i dont consider anything a cinch unless you have something like a 0 game lead with 0 games to go  i do think that the jays have the best talented team in the al east and if we had a good or even average manager we might have a bigger lead right now  i also think that the orioles will not play much better than 000 baseball for the rest of the season  you win    from kingcogsciucsdedu thu nov 00 000000 0000  in article 0000nov000000000000cscornelledu you write 0 indiansthe first and only 0000 season ever    prediction  the cleveland indians will win 00 or more games next year  you were right    from

an injury  he had 000 ip but didnt win the cy young  maddux surprised all  0 the orioles will win 00 games in at least 0 of the next 0 years probably the last 0 and their pitching staff will have a team era among the best 0 in the al in at least 0 of the next 0 years but not necessarily all the same years as they win 00 this one will take a long time to verify  i dont think i want to wait that long  but they won 00 games last year and they were fifth in the league in era  not a bad start  0 ben mcdonald will not challenge for an era title in the next 0 years nor will he have 00 victories either year by challenge i mean finish among the leaders being among the leaders before the season is done doesnt count  he will probably never be the pitcher he was hyped to be but is still a decent starter to have  looks like it  he wasnt bad last year just too consistent to be an ace  so far this year looks like more of the same  0 the phillies will give up many fewer walks ifwhen they get rid of their bullpen coach ryan i am not predicting when or whether they will get rid of him and you will have to give the team a little bit of time to adjust  before seeing the radical change they would have a fine pitching staff if  they would just steal ray miller away from pittsburg the white sox seem to have the same problem but not as bad  i honestly cant say  did they get rid of him  their bb totals were down last year  0 ricky jordan will have 00 rbi if he starts 000 games hitting in the 0 or 0 or 0 spot in any lineup or the 0 spot in a lineup with very good obp in the 00 hitters this applies for each of the next 0 years  i just dont think hes that good  00 billy ripken will never again hit over 000 with 000 ab    so far so good  im definitely not waiting to check this one    from panixspiracmcl0nyuedu fri sep 00 000000 0000  no matter what lou gorman and his scouts say paul quantrill will never ever be an adequate major league starter  never  i have never seen a starting pitcher who can only strike out 0 per 0 innings at aaa be successful in the majors  current plans seem to be to use quantrill in long relief  he has a rubber arm and unusual delivery  he might be

cal every opportunity to have his stats tumble a bit from last years pace before coming forth with an offer  despite claims that opcy was designed to cals strength my feeling is that the 000 foot

   why are the red sox in first place  eight games into the season they already have two wins each from clemens and viola  clemens starts again tonight on three days rest  whats up  are the sox going with a fourman rotation  is this why hesketh was used in relief last night  hm  cheers valentine ps i was wrong  the sox have already scored 00 runs in two games this week  they should reach 00 without trouble  i still think its a fluke

  from another notsodistressedbutstillwonderingaboutafewthings cardinal fan  joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball  hes not the greatest  this is true  for anyone who didnt see sundays game  i saw it  with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers  lankford was hurt although the announcer said he told torre he could pinch hit if they needed him to  later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a 000 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea a 000 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  what the hell is he thinking  i wondered the same thing  but giving joe the benefit of the  doubt id say he was thinking that lankford is hurt enough that he didnt trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his speed on the bases so pinch run him  alicea i was completely confused about  maybe he had a good record hitting against that particular pitcher  i dont know  anybody got an idea  earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said he liked gilkey coming off the bench  gilkey hit over 000 last year what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every team in the league  well so far i havent seen much to say whiten shouldnt be playing but it is too bad that gilkey is the odd man out when they play  jordan ahead of him  that i dont quite understand  furthermore in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate  the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home   yup i looked for this on the replay too  if im joe torre im going to have a talk with bucky after the game on that one  hes got lankford at third with todd zeile i believe  a hot hitter   coming up  theres no reason to risk giving lankford the go sign  in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands   its his job to watch the play develop  he should have known larkin  was there to back up a bad throw  that seemed inexcusable in my book   btw i saw dent do the same thing last year with zeile rounding third  and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation  on the  replay theres dent waving him around  it looks like this might be a  serious problem  the cards werent good base runners at all last year  and i wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching   i cant take this anymore  well im still hanging in there  go redbirds  woof woof  brian a very distressed cardinal fan    brian landmann                                             georgia institute of technology                            internetgt0000aprismgatechedu                         dick detweiler  rdetweilhpdmd00boihpcom

  i seem to have misplaced the baseball bibliography that was posted here recently  thats what happens when you have to split a heap of disorganized files from one machine among two others  could some kind soul repost the bibliography or mail me a copy  also in particular a colleague of mine is looking for any information he can find on moe berg catcherlinguistespion of ww0  any references or anecdotes for that matter would be appreciated  dave  i believe si had an indepth article on moe a while ago i remember that the article revealed some new facts regarding the secretive moe my si subscription expired this past february the second of two years that i received same therefore my guess is that the article appeared sometime in 000000   can anyone else be more definitive as to a date of the si article    jerry    
   after reading my local paper today i found out that the phillies started the 0000 season at 000  i am not as old as 0000 but ive heard many talk about the serious choke job the phillies did that season they were ahead of the cardinals by 00 games that season in midaugust  they managed to lose a bunch from then on and the cardinals took the division  00 games ahead and lost it i hope this season is much different   strictly from memory i think the phillies were something like ten games up with 00 to go lost 00 in a row and 00 of last 00 to lose to the cardinals seems impossible but thats how i remember it i also felt at the time that johnny callison of the phillies lost the mvp as a byproduct of their swoon   jerry  ps in 0000 a single team out of 0 won the pennant no divisions

  do you mean just like reds fans  have you listened to wlw anytime they open up the lines for fans to call  talk about clueless idiots  the broadcasters are just as bad too  jl  the new york talk shows are just awful in this regard  people are constantly calling wfan and wabc with stuff like i was thinking why dont the yankees trade kaminicki and silvestri to seattle for ken griffey jr and randy johnson that would really help the team  or do you think the yankees can get roger  clemens  the show hosts are pretty good about handling these guys but its still annoying  the best one was at the end of one show a caller started out with i was  thinking why dont the yankees trade for and then the host hung up on him  i cheered  michael

   landmann writes  joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball    for anyone who didnt see sundays game    with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed  hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers        thats because lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games before that     and was daytoday only available as a pinchrunner      later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts  lankford a 000 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis  alicea a 000 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  what the hell  is he thinking       see above    earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented  how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a  regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said  he liked gilkey coming off the bench  gilkey hit over 000 last year  what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every  team in the league       at the beginning of the interview torre also said lankford is the one outfield     guy whos in there no matter what     my guess is jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low     on base percentage  whiten was a great acquisition decent offense     and great defense in rightfield  but dont worry gilkey will be starting             as soon as jordan or whiten displays an extended period of low offensive     output

   some pleasant and then some not so pleasant surprises about the 0000 edition of the bronx bombers so far  first the pleasant  0spike owen  all through spring training this guy was    looking like the second coming of mike gallego but with   even worse hitting now the guy is third in the major leagues   in ba and hes ranked pretty high in total hits and runs   scored i know its still early in the season but he and    pat kelly more on him in a minute have provided a lot of    spark at the bottom of the order thats given the big guys   mattingly tartabull oneill plenty of rbi opportunities   lets hope he keeps this up  0pat kelly the guy is finally showing some of the ability   that led stick michael to label him a star for the 00s   i wouldnt go that far but kelly looks infinitely improved   at bat i guess the tips he took from boggs in spring training   really paid off huh and here i thought boggs would never   do anything to help anybody besides himself and his glove   like always has been terrific he and mattingly comprise the   best defensive right side of the infield in all of baseball imho  0paul oneill we had to get rid of roberto kelly partly    because he was under too much pressure in ny to be the next   barry bonds he wont do that in cincy either and partly   because he had this real unprofessional tendency to give up   in the second half of the year i just felt that we couldve   gotten more for him than oneill well so far oneill is   turning out just fine he looks like he should be able to   duplicate if not surpass mel halls numbers from last year   and he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around tartabull   now if only buck would play him against lefties some more to    see what he can do  0wickman a friend made a comparison between wickman and jack   morris  they never have impressive stats but they always   find some way to win although morris seems to be losing that   ability i figured that wickman would be the least important   part of the steve sax trade best trade since we got that ruth   guy maybe winding up as a good middle reliever but i like what   ive seen so far he doesnt pitch pretty but he gets the job done  0key whats going on here key was just supposed to provide   the rotation with some stability you know shore up the left   side provide experience get maybe 00 wins and here this guy   is dominating everybody he faces who needs maddux or cone 00   ill take key any day  and now the not so pleasant surprises  0spike owen sure hes hitting like crazy but the guy cannot   field to save his life and they said he was brought in to   provide defense velarde stankiewicz and even silvestri   are better defensively than owen          remember  its still early look for his offense to tail off and his defense to improve hopefully he has that rep because i heard that either last year or over the last 0 years or something like that  he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops  behind cr and tony im not gonna help this sorry mets team at all fernandez i do agree though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far  0tartabull the book on tartabull was keep him healthy and   hell produce well he hasnt done too much so far sure hes   hit a few homers but those were all solo shots and he hasnt   gotten any of the big rbis that your cleanup man is supposed   to give you then again he had a slow start last year once he   got off the dl that is and turned into a oneman wrecking crew   late in the year so well see  0the bullpen ughwhat happened we were supposed to have   one of the most solid pens in the majors meanwhile the pen   has already blown three saves maybe more  i havent checked   the great howefarr leftyrighty tandem farrs era is in the   00s or 00s and howes isinfinite i didnt think such   a thing was possible but it is hopefully theyll get their   acts together or else bucks gonna burn out the starters   for fear that the bullpenll blow a lead  in the immortal words of the scooter holy cow seaver that johnny key guy can pitch cant he  see you in the series  alan

   are you for real  how many gold gloves does ozzie smith have  if a guy hung around and hit 00 homers a year for 00 years wouldnt he be a given for the hall  is defense not just as important  frankly no  offense and defense are equally important  but the pitcher is 00 of the defense  the primary role of every other player is on offense  even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive game than of the defensive game  they might not do much with their part of the offense but thats another issue  that being said i think both smith and yount deserve the hof  they hit pretty well in addition to their defense  cheers valentine

   there is a book that you can find in sale catalogues occasionally called jewish baseball stars and baseball mavin peter bjarkman has compiled a pretty definitive list of jewish ballplayers in the bigs    i wish i hadnt sold my copy of jewish baseball stars  its a short shelf ie the one on top of the toilet tank special  the writing in that  books is so astonishingly awful  every sportswriting cliche taken to the nth degree and then mangled  that its funny  rusinow is the author i think  roger

   i made a mistake on the posted article been fighting food poisoning for last 00 hours  the second paragraph should state the following  doctors cleared sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball on a tee and to catch a ball in his gloved hand  sorry for the error didnt know it until after posting  jeffery

    writes  in the new book about the mets it talks about how they like to rape little  girls before games  sick jerks                                      max   is this the book by bob klapisch spelling the worst team money can buy  if it is i wouldnt give the book or anything in it any value whatsoever  klapisch wrote the book to make money obviously and sensational literature is going to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for the papers  im not calling him a liar but if there was any proof that a met player had raped a little girl before a game let alone doing it on a regular basis they would be in jail not shea for those people who do not know what the press is like in new york it is probably more cutthroat than in just about any other part of the us  keith hernandez said it very well on espn a couple of days ago they would much rather mention a clubhouse fight than a tworun homer in the ninth to win a game  i do not read klapischs news columns regularly but i do know that he has been accused before as being an instigator that enjoys hopefully for only professional reasons to drumb up a news story even if there isnt one there  now as far as the confrontation with bobby bonilla a few days ago i almost totally blame bonilla  no matter what a member of the press does and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might be that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a journalist   personally i always thought that a beat writer that always follows a club around should report the news but not be looking to degrade a team  i dont know whether to blame klapisch because that may be the only way to keep a job in new york

    in article 0000bluecispittedu travenpittedu neal traven writes  one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around 000 and 00   id give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe 000 or  even 0000 give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds  identical batting stats which wouldnt be that unreasonable and  even if you dont let roberto steal a single base theyll score a lot  more than the oleruds by going firsttothird more often no offense  gordon  i wouldnt give baserunning that much value  the above effect is clear but there are other effects as well  if olerud hits a double any runner on first will score if alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap the runner on first may need to hold at third  thus oleruds doubles have more advancement value than alomars  of course alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double  another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams  no team in the 0000s ran much but some teams certainly had faster players than others  still the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 0000s for all teams    bill james gives the 00000000 senators as an example  they used harmon killebrew regularly as a pinch runner and in 0000 stole 00 bases with 00 times caught stealing  yet they scored slightly more runs than predicted by runs created     david grabiner grabinerzariskiharvardedu we are sorry but the number you have dialed is imaginary please rotate your phone 00 degrees and try again disclaimer i speak for no one and no one speaks for me

  disclaimer  this is for fun  in my computerized baseball game i keep track of a category called stolen hits defined as a play made that an average fielder would not make with average effort  using the 0000 defensive averages posted by sherri nichols thanks sherri ive figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen hits stolen have been redefined as plays kurt stillwell would not have made  ok i realize thats unfair  kurts probably the victim of pitching staff fluke shots and a monster park factor  but lets put it this way  if we replaced every second baseman in the nl with someone with kurts 000 out making ability how many extra hits would go by  to try and correlate it to reality a little more ive calculated net hits stolen based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make  by the same method ive calculated net double plays and net extra bases doubles and triples let by  finally i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution or dcon   basically it represents the defensive contribution of a player i add this number to ops to get dops defense  onbase plus slug which should represent the players total contribution to the team  so dont take it too seriously  the formula for dcon appears at the end of this article  the short version  definition of terms hs  hits stolen  extra outs compared to kurt stillwell nhs  net hits stolen  extra outs compared to average fielder ndp  net double plays  extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder neb  net extra bases   extra bases prevented compared to avg fielder dcon  defensive contribution  bases and hits prevented as a rate dops  dcon  ops  quick  dirty measure of players total contribution  national league  name            hs   nhs   ndp   neb   dcon    dops alicea l      00    00    0    0    000    000 sandberg r   000    00    0     0    000   0000 thompson r    00    00    0    0    000    000 lind j        00     0   0     0    000    000 doran b       00    0    0     0    000    000 deshields d   00     0   0     0   000    000 harris l      00    0    0     0   000    000 lemke m       00    0   0    0   000    000 morandini m   00    0   0     0   000    000 randolph w    00   00    0    0   000    000 biggio c      00   00   0     0   000    000 stillwell k    0   00   0    0   000    000  ordered by dops  0000 sandberg  000 alicea  000 thompson  000 deshields  000 doran  000 nl average  000 biggio  000 harris  000 randolph  000 morandini  000 lemke  000 lind  000 stillwell  american league   name            hs   nhs   ndp   neb   dcon    dops fletcher s    00    00    0     0    000    000 reed j        00    00    0     0    000    000 ripken b      00     0   0    0    000    000 baerga c      00     0   00     0    000    000 blankenship l 00     0    0     0    000    000 miller k      00    0    0    0   000    000 alomar r      00     0   0    0   000    000 knoblauch c   00   00    0    0   000    000 bordick m     00    0   0    0   000    000 kelly p       00    0   0    0   000    000 whitaker l    00    0   0    0   000    000 reynolds h    00    0   0     0   000    000 sax s         00    0   0    0   000    000 sojo l        00   00   0     0   000    000  order by dops  000 baerga 000 alomar 000 fletcher 000 whitaker 000 blankenship 000 miller 000 knoblauch 000 reed 000 bordick 000 al average 000 kelly 000 ripken 000 reynolds 000 sojo 000 sax  more discussion   dcon formula  nhs  ndppa  nhs  ndp  nebab why such a bizzare formula  basically its designed to be added into the ops with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored the extra outs are factored into obp while the extra bases removed are  factored into slg  thats why i used pa and ab as the divisors  for more discussion see the post on hits stolen  first base 0000   dale j stephenson  stephcsuiucedu  baseball fanatic    it is considered good to look wise especially when not     overburdened with information  j golden kimball

  as of today april 00 jack morris has lost his first three starts  however the jays are doing well without him and injured dave stuart  this is a credit to the rest of the pitching staff  has jack lost a bit of his edge what is the worst start jack morris has had    
    davis and strawberry attributed their turn arounds to reggie smith the dodger batting coach who flew in from florida three days ago and gave them a pep talk and some instruction  davis was 00 yesterday and had a couple more hits today  strawberry had two hits yesterday and i believe he had two more today with two home runs   foolish me  and here i thought it had something to do with the  fact that they were hitting against wakefield who had no kncukle to his ball that day and otto who has no stuff  i wonder if  reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the lineup who also suddenly came alive those two games    the beastmaster     mark singer     mssnetcomcom

  kingozcamelotbradleyedu orin roth writes     well officially its the braves at least up until they started winning    it was are they still officially     if so why and how did they receive this label        unoffically but without a doubt americas team is the cubs why    well my guess is because america loves underdogs every year no matter    the cubs talent or the predictions they never as close to never as    possible win anything over the years as the losing has mounted america    has fallen in love with these perennial losers the cubs have more fans    in chicago then some teams do worldwide the cubs have more fans     worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined     an aura of excitement surrounds the cubs at the beginning of the season    like no one else including the ws champs it must be that eternal hope    this is the year theyve got the talent theyre off to a good start     theyve got the pitching or hitting or whatever their strong point is     at the time its that inevitability that the cubs will eventually      win the ws again when only god knows since its been so long it     could come at any time or it could be another 00 years but until they    do finally win and start winning consistently the cubs will remain    americas lovable underdogs the cubs areamericas team    orin    bradley u  the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes out of nowhere to contend  the 00 mets and 00 orioles are prime examples not the cubs  i root for the cubs because i feel sorry for them but  basically they are dogs  the pirates today are a great example of an underdog if the rockies and marlins compete they will be underdogs  the north stars trip to the stanley cup finals was a good example of an underdogs journey  the cubs have a good team this year and play in a weak division they are much less than americas team      im really a jester in disguise                                      chintan amin the university of illinois urbanachampaign mail llamauiucedu neil peart c0000 quick to judge quick to anger slow to understand ignorance and prejudice andfearwalkhandinhand

          bs about darkness deleted oh lighten up  what depresses me is that they might actually  finish last which i believe hasnt happened since their second season in  0000 nope the royals are the only team in the majors that have not      finished in last place        of course this doesnt include       the marlins and the rockies but they have a good chance at       finishing last also rich    
   in a previous article tedwardcscornelledu edward ted fischer says  in article 0qr00cinnpelskeenaucsubcca stlouisunixgubcca phill st louis writes jack morris starts have been like his playoff starts  he has an era of 0000 in his 0 starts  what does luck have to do with a 0000 era  he was lucky to get 00 wins last year but he had an era of 000 with a team that scored a lot of runs  i would be happy if he could still pitch with an era of 000 but he seems to be suffering from a total callapse    bad pitchers are more prone to this total collapse than good pitchers they are closer to the chasm of mediocrity  the smallest push and they completely lose their grip       but good ones can collapse somewhat then come back the next year burleigh grimes went from 00 wins and an era of 0 or so in 00 to 0000 and an era around 0 in 00  he pitched well for several more years  carlton won 00 and lost 00 the year after his 0000 record source bill james historical baseball abstract      and lets not forget john tudor who started 00 and finished 000 in 0000  he had a pretty bad era when you take busch stadium into account at the start of the season  he gave up early runs in his 00 games and would get stronger as the game went on thus giving up few runs in the last going  he stays in the game and gets the win how else would he have pitched so many innings  yup  he used to dig himself a hole then get it together and stick in until the run support eventually came through  this year he just hasnt gotten it together       if i recall he had a 000 era in the 0st half and a 000 era in the 0nd half of last year        hmmm 00 runs in 00 innings  suppose he starts 00 more games and winds up w000 innings pitched  if he allows 0 runs a game in the next 000 innings hell have a 000 era or so at the end of the year i think i have his totals right this is going to be hard to come back from  jack may be finished  it is time to retire or be released if he does not return to his form from last year  his 0 million contract is an awful lot to eat       my 0st hunch is that morris is very gutsy and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone  my 0nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts perhaps when stewart comes off the dl  or will danny cox who went 0 or 0 scoreless innings against the tribe today start for morris  he looks like a really good one  gaston is scrambling to find starters id imagine luckily the jays have a very good offense      i dont think they would dare release him before the end of the year hell just be replaced by stewart or cox   doug fowler dxf00pocwruedu   me age 0  now mommys and daddys  other     ever wonder if after casey  relatives have to give lots of hugs  love missed the 0rd strike in the poem  support cause heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it      big hug that lasts forever and ever

   in a previous article swedacssitdumichedu sean sweda says   ive been saying this for quite some time but being absent from the net for a while i figured id stick my neck out a bit  the royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an al team since the inception of the dh rule  ps any ideas what this is  they will fall easily short of 000 runs thats for damn sure  i cant believe these media fools picking them to win the division like our tom gage of the detroit news claiming herk robinson is some kind of genius for the tradesaquisitions hes made       would you say the same thing about the dodgers in 00 or 00  true cone is probably as good as drysdale and they have no koufax but still these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals with lots of lowscoring games etc  and they didnt use relievers whereas jeff montgomery is having a super season for them      that being said i still picked them 0th or so but i think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting  theres more of a chance of that i think than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching  at least to me      i wonder though  which one do you people think would do better  a team with johnson koufax in his prime seaver carlton and young in no real order as the starters with sutter fingers and lyle in the bullpen but with a puny offense assuming good defense like mazeroski maranville etc or a team with poor pitching but with an offense of cobb carew ruth gehrig mays schmidt wagner and bench  againyou pick the order      i would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons end  even the best hitters can succeed only 00 of the time in their best years but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts  taking all the players in their prime they might throw 00 shutouts in a year  and all the offense would have to do is get 0 run across      i wonder if someone with stratomatic or something could plug such all time teams into a regular season have it played and report the results i would love to see that   doug fowler dxf00pocwruedu   me age 0  now mommys and daddys  other     ever wonder if after casey  relatives have to give lots of hugs  love missed the 0rd strike in the poem  support cause heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it      big hug that lasts forever and ever

  to all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three homer games ina career the answer is johnny mize in his career with the  cards and the yanks  he hit three 0 times  i am almost sure about this in case anyone is wondering the record for two homer games is held by babe ruth and is 00  mizes record may not last for much longer because of juan gonzalez  he has at least three games with three and maybe 0  i know that  he had at least two last year and one as a rookie  i dont have any record books at college for me to check on though  please let me know okay if i  am wrong   onto the padres  is there anyone out there who follows them especially those with access to local news  i dont here anything in los angeles and i cant get mcpaper consistently around here   comment  it looks as though san diego has gotten the better of the two deals that brought bell and plantier to the padres  it has also forced the team to use darrell shermann  of course plantier could get injured again or he could  hit with the power of 00 but with a lower average  bell always could finish with 000 and 0000 hrsessentially jerald clarks numbers   leadoff comment  craig shipley  i get on base 00 of the time if im  lucky at leadoff  hell of the usual starters use gwynn  hes got 0 steals already  is shipley starting because of an injury to stillwell though  i havent seen stillwells name in any box scores  anyway unless you are going to use shermann at leadoff then use gwynn  he at lesat gets on base and this year is stealing bases sheffield comment  though the season is early and stats mean nothing witness phillips batting 000 currently  but does sheffield have an injury or anythingelse wrong with him  i just dont hear anything andy benes  is he pitching like he did in the second half of 00   or is  this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then   has anyone  seen him pitch the two good games score for today sunday april 00  padres 00 st louis 0  padres sweep the cardinals as gwynn goes 0 for 0 with a homer  sheffield and tueful also homer in a winning cause   thanks for listeningreading any comments  kelly keach kkeachpomonaclaremontedu

   so far simmons looks like a total idiot   0 zane smith should learn how to switchpitch and return from the dl i would rather have zane smith pitch right handed than have moeller pitch at all  0 i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an impressive win last week now ottos latest debacle has restored simmons reputation now he looks like he is back in his 00 form when he had the als highest era among starters four our sakenot teds sake i hope he pitches with a 00 era for the rest of the season yeah right  0 tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing they are still doing decently but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters merced had a very good oba his rookie year he showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year  0 walk well he seems to be on the losing end tonight but i still think that walk desrved his contract  0 leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation i cant understand his and managements fear of losing tom prince through waivers even if they do whats the use he is aright hander like slaught not a very smart platoon also i am blaming leyland in this case since he is hcurrently    convinced that lavalliere is through while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffsslaught should have played in all 0 games he has a good average against right handed pitching didnt leyland and simmons forsee this last year and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself any fool could tell them lavalliere wasnt very fit last year  0 dennis moeller is scary 0 candeleria well he is not going to have such a high era at the end of the season maybe it will be in 00 range but 0 million  plus come on other than the customary home run giving stage patterson goes through for a few weeks patterson has served the pirates very well each year so far he seems to have pitched well for the rangers i think the pirates should have spent the money on patterson in stead  0 the rookie batters well young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact other than that their excellent performance hasnt been too much of a surprise i think we should thank doughty for that  0 rookie pitchers worse than expected especially cooke 00 slaught how come he wasnt given a contract extension last year now his value has increased immensely  00 lonnie smith well eric davis was signed for a comparable amount lets see eric can hit better he can run better he can field better now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis an injured davis is better than a healthy lonnie smith even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this yearhe wont be an asset he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field  00 management big big zero sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing he seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay 00 alex cole fiasco the pirates infield and cf positions look good the rf and lf would have looked good if we could have gotten cole to replace two of the four outfielders eric davis van slyke and cole would have made a very respectable outfield even without eric davis thye pirates would have a respectable outfield with cole svan slyke and mercedi think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting simmons did have options for the outfield ironically the biggest accomplishment of simmons tenure was getting alex cole really cheap too bad  00 compensatory draft picks for bonds forget it the pirates can rant and rave they will not get those picks as of now the issue is still being appealed now if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots nothing else will  on a final note tim wakefield wont be as awful as he was in his last 0 starts but dont count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season also if the pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season they will miss reduss clutch hitting and his speedhe has peaked in the second half of the last 0 seasons   pravin ratnam

   there are two conflicting reports about a pitcher that is either in the jays farm system or the braves his name is bill taylor he was picked up by the jays but had to be offered back to the braves before they were able to send him to the syracuse chiefs  one report says that the braves took him back and assigned him to richmond the other says that he is on the chiefs roster which one is right

   so far simmons looks like a total idiot  0 leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation i cant understand his and managements fear of losing tom prince through waivers even if they do whats the use he is aright hander like slaught not a very smart platoon also i am blaming leyland in this case since he is hcurrently    convinced that lavalliere is through while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffsslaught should have played in all 0 games he has a good average against right handed pitching didnt leyland and simmons forsee this last year and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself any fool could tell them lavalliere wasnt very fit last year  sorry but this is the biggest load of bunk ive seen in a while  a the pirates have been trying to trade lavalliere for some time now nobody was even vaguely interested b several other teams had made it known that they would grab prince who was out of options c lavallieres release had nothing to do with him being through he was released because in the event of an injury to slaught lavalliere is no longer capable they believe of being the everyday catcher  since slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties the offense should actually improve with this move  toby

  michael chen mikecunixfcccolumbiaedu wrote   in any case i think viola would have made a better signing  why  viola is younger and is left handed how many left handed starters does  toronto have  well i agree that viola is a better signing  however why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters  i understand lefthanded spot relievers even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters  i just dont understand why people insist on lefthanded starters unless there is a park effect eg yankee stadium most batters in mlb are righthanded so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters i guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to lhps than rhps  however this is probably only a factor in the postseason because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season  i think you just want the best starters you can get regardless of whether they are lefties or righties  lefthanded starters tend to have higher eras than righthanded starters precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties or perhaps because of the platoon advantage  am i missing something here  craig  
   hey valentine i dont see boston with any world series rings on their fingers  yah  so  damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his  future  he certainly didnt earn his last one  how many games did he blow in the world series  all of the ones he started  therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing  oh yes  definitely  therefore morris is better than clemens  dont give me that shit  if boston had alomar olerud henke and ward while toronto had rivera jack clark jeff reardon things would have looked a little different last fall  give credit where credit is due  this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick  and dont tell me boston will win this year  they wont  even be in the top 0 in the division more like 0th  im willing to bet they dont finish sixth  im also willing to bet they dont finish first  and if you give me 00 odds im willing to bet that they finish ahead of the blue jays  valentine  
   the only really valid retort to valentine is werent the red sox trying to get morris too oh sure they said viola was their first choice afterwards but what should we have expected they would say  lou wanted morris all along  the idiot  giving the man 00 million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded uzi with the safety off  the only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away   and dont tell me boston will win this year  they wont   even be in the top 0 in the division more like 0th  if this is true it wont be for lack of contribution by viola so who cares  i dont see why people expect boston to finish sixth  the bottom four teams last year were essentially tied  boston in seventh place had 00 wins  the yankees and indians tied for fourth place had 00 wins  now i should think it is obvious that the red sox improved more than the indians or tigers  basically the red sox are stronger this year at 0b dh ss lf and rf  they have healthier starting pitchers so far at least and better relievers  i see no reason why they shouldnt win 00 games  meanwhile the indians are in shambles and the tigers still have no pitching  they will win some 000 blowouts but they will lose an awful lot of 00 games too  maybe the sox will play poorly win 00 games and finish fifth but i think third or fourth place is more likely  cheers valentine

  the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their quest for more lefthanded pitching  so far no takers personally i think harris is a defensive liability and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays or at least been among the leaders   sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day he can get the job done  if sharpy played just one base every day say third hed also improve defensively   wallach has helped tremendously on defense as has reed the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff  both astacio and martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years   astacio lasted 0 innings the other day under similar circumstances the dodgers are turning double plays and keeping more balls in the infield than last year  and piazza has also been great on defense  he has thrown out 00 of 00 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first   wallach clearly has contributed to the over all improvement on defense  but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers some runs  but i dont think he is as bad as his current average i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw seem to have come out of theirs   dodger

  or second starter  it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs  the team that scores the most  runs wins  this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs  a low  scoring game would clearly benefit the braves   not clear to me at all  id certainly rather have a team who was winning 00 games than 00 games  in the 00 game luck is going to play a much bigger role than in the 00 game   sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

  reed0000iscsvaxuniedu writes         dave winfields name does not go  in the same sentence as aaron robinson and ott            in terms of peak and i repeat peak years winfield has done it   all he has batted in the 000s for a season drove in 000 and more runs   many times in a row before his injury consistently hit at or near 000   while knocking in 00 home runs have you even looked at dave winfields   slugging percentage for three or 0 of his best seasons i still think that   dave was one of the better of all time but obviously not the best he was   one of the best athletes evr to play baseball he hit line drives that hit   the scoreboard in leftcenter field a feat np one has done in the new   stadium heck only 0 or 0 other people have hit it over that green fence   since it has been remodeled he could field had a bullet arm and his   hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields and barry bonds   of last season he is older now and slowing down takes more of an   uppercut to lift the ball out of the park but he will always be my hero   and my idol there is nothing that could make me happier than george   inviting dave back to the bronx to play his last year of ball with the   yankees of course he will most likely refuse the offer but who knows   for 0 million dollars hell play heck they are giving gallego 00   million this year having dave as their dh while leaving him time to play   the field when tartabull is injured or nokes and mass are traded should   give the yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age   of yankee domination   michael lurie  
  sepinwall writes    some pleasant and then some not so pleasant surprises about the 0000  edition of the bronx bombers so far    0wickman a friend made a comparison between wickman and jack    morris  they never have impressive stats but they always    find some way to win although morris seems to be losing that    ability i figured that wickman would be the least important    part of the steve sax trade best trade since we got that ruth    guy maybe winding up as a good middle reliever but i like   what    ive seen so far he doesnt pitch pretty but he gets the job   done           actually i kind of liked the abott trade we did trade the rookie of   the year snow but with don mattingly at first for another 0 years why   bother  
  sepinwall writes  farrs era is in the    00s or 00s and howes isinfinite i didnt think such    a thing was possible but it is    actually according to usa today howe has 0 inning atttributed to him   but maybe that is incorrect by the excellent report  
   ill tell youm all one thing steve howe and farr are much better then the   worst pitcher in yankee pitching    who do you think i am talking about ill post the answers if you email   to me use reply or post youre answers but emailing them to me meaqns   that i will post the final results i have one particular horrid pitcher   in mind  
  sepinwall writes    thanks alan that was well thought out  even written in an entertaining style  
       hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves it i mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon  oh yeah  dave winfieldmarginal player  guy didnt hit a lick had negligible power was a crap fielder and had no staying power  dave winfield now entering his i believe 00th big league season is still a damn decent hitter  admittedly his defense has slipped a great deal but in his prime he had a powerful arm and great range  take a look at the stats  i dont  know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman are similar players  kingman was a onedimension power hitterhe couldnt field he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if i remember right his obp wasnt that hideous and for those who consider such things important was a absoluteprimodick   eddie murray  yup only the best 0st baseman of the 00s  i know that mvp votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of the mvp he deserved in 0000 it seems that he wasnt overrated by the media   lee smith  hmmmm this ones actually pretty close  hes had a s solid dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  wrigley fenway  id have to take a closer look at the stats its been  a while but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber   you do make a legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers simply racking up a lot of saves doesnt mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch too  simply because minnesota and boston and for a month atlanta used reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one  the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves  no way should  homerman be in the hof imho darrell evans  nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like ted simmons imho but not a hofer       well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards marginal  lemme ask you this  who the hell playing the game isnt marginal  honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there theyre both shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal lets be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something  now wait a goddamn minute here  ozzie smith absolutely redefined the position of shortstop  his defense was so good that hes won something along the lines of 00 gold gloves  again gold gloves are mediotbiased and a  good argument could be made that larkin deserved one or two of ozzies more recent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early 00s getting the gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier in his career  ozzies offense you ask  good obp great speed numbers in a park which for most of his career depressed offense admittedly no power cept against tom niedenfuer  but still a definite asset offensively yount  0000 hits mvp at two different positions uhhuh a real stiff  his 00 was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks as far as ss numbers go  hes a clear hofer imho  isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when  certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential  candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan  well as far as garvey goes youre right  garvey is a mediot  candidate pushed because of his winning attitude a minor factor if one at all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range of a tree stump  garvey shouldnt be in the hof skyjack  ive said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last year or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about morris ability to win which is nothing more than morris ability to pitch when toronto to score tons of runs  at this point morris is an average pitcher although from his early returns in 00 he may be damned  close to done  but in all fairness morris was a dominant pitcher in the 00s for upanddown tiger teams  while 0000 was obviously a great year for detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention but not favorites  morris career numbers are quite good and worthy of hof consideration   ryan  of course but be careful  i guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about yount and smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time  after all nolan never won a cy  damn hes  just pitcher who hung around for 00 years  his wl record is mediocre of course nolans a hofer puck  probably although hes got to play reasonably well for a few more years 00 years even good ones arent enough to make the hof most likely  that said i believe puckett will make the hof pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something really  tragic or sudden  hes very popular in the media and with fans and legitimately has been one of the best cfs in the game since he joined the league  ive always liked the guy and i hope he does make it  and in the end i think the puck will make it in  but really its too early to sell  this debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it  or not i never tire of it  its an interesting subject  heres an off the top of my head list of potential hofers from each team  i probably left a couple of guys off so feel free to follow up  i wont consider anyone who started playing after about 0000 again too early to tell note these are all active players im not counting recent retirees  baltimore  cal ripken should be a lock by now even if gehrigs record stands boston roger clemens might be a lock already which is amazing dawson  detroit alan trammell and lou whitaker possibilities milwaukee robin yount discussed earlier new york wade boggs possibly mattingly long shot toronto paul molitor and jack morris possibilities  kansas city george brett lock minnesota kirby too early to tell winfield lock oakland eckersley lock mcgwire too early rickey lock welch long shot texas the mighty nolan too early to consider canseco or strange   cubs sandberg lock st louis ozzie lock lee smith probably new york murray almost a lock saberhagen obviously hes got to regain         past form and most certainly not vince coleman despite what hell tell you   los angeles butler strawberry and hershiser are all long shots san diego tony gwynn pretty good shot colorado dale murphy a good shot ryan bowen just to see if youre awake  before i get flames this is an offthetopofthehead list theres probably a few deserving candidates that i left off and i didnt include barry bonds will clark any atlanta starting pitcher frank thomas canseco mcgriff etc because i only considered guys who started playing before 0000  email or post i almost fear what i may have started here   bruce hasch                haschjhuvmshcfjhuedu        sell the team eli if a hitter is a good fastball hitter does that mean i should throw him a  bad fastball larry andersen  
  darryl strawberrys moon shots were fun  he can hit those high and far home runs that if he actually ran them out hed be rounding second base by the time they landed  we used to say that he should have to file a flight plan at laguardia for some of them  then bulldurham came out and that was changed    on homers he pulled that didnt go high they were microwave home runs microwave as in they got outta there in a hurry  in a game in 0000 he came off the bench with the flu and on the second pitch send a rocket down the right field line that didnt even allow bob murphy the luxury of a home run call  the story went he stayed in the clubhouse the with the mets down by two and two on davey johnson sent for him to pinch hit he came out of the clubhouse saying one swing and we go home  he hit the homer ran the bases then went straight for the clubhouse to shower and go home  those were the days   scott barman     mets mailing list feed the following into your shell scottasdcom               mail metsrequestasdcom                              subscribe  lets go mets               
  my question to you all is why does the media seem to embrace the theme of the death of baseball so strongly  i have seen articles of a similar vein in  the chicago tribune and in sports editorials on tv  maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom  these allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times losing money bankruptcies at an alarming rate and theres going to be an increased degradation of the product they produce  could you imagine ibm with all their problems promoting themselves the way major league baseball does  their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths not that they are too far from it now   what would happen at gm  where would gm be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an inferior product because of alleged labor problems i think it shows a lack of confidence for the people who run the game  anyway it just frustrates me when the media says such things because it inevitably leads to owners trying quick fixes like increasing playoffs to satisfy television or trying interleague play to drum up interest    forget it  word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about a done deal  it has to be decided soon since negotiations with the networks also have to begin soon   scott barman     mets mailing list feed the following into your shell scottasdcom               mail metsrequestasdcom                              subscribe  lets go mets

  boy hats off to any cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put down braves fans  i mean all the braves have done is gone to two consecutive world series  also being the cubs fan that i am i really have to hand it to all the braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that infernal cheer that they have    however i do have to protest anyone saying that all cubs fans are stupid  the way i see it either im just too stupid to acknowledge it or that observation was just plain wrong  you might have us confused with bear fans   anyway about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the cubs would finish up last in their division  even behind florida  sheesh   these same people were predicting the braves to clean up in their respective division  well  were ten games into the season and these people are a little less vocal now  i wonder why  well the way i see it the east is up for grabs and whoever wants it most is going to take it with the exception of florida  every team seems to have good batting and pitching with philly presently leading the pack  but i just have to point out if the cubs do take the east theyll do it without the benefit of a competent manager  however and it pains me to say it the pennant is going to go to the west  just had to get that off my chest  doc  bem benefit of a compee  
  was going over some videos last night  studying 0000 and 0000 videotapes of jose canseco proved to be very interesting  and enlightening  heres my analysis of jose canseco circa sep 00 and jose canseco circa june 0000  0  hes bulked up too much  period  he needs to lose about 00 pounds     not gain more bulk  0  his bat speed has absolutely vanished  conservatively id say hes     lost 00 of his bat speed and thats a huge amount of speed  0  that open stance is killing him   note that he acts sort of like     brian downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is     released  downing could do this without significant head movement      canseco cant  also note that canseco doesnt always close his     stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes     theyre fully closed  without a good starting point its hard     to make adjustments in your swing  what would i do if i were jose  aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch so that id never have to work again id restructure my entire swing  first minimize movement before the swing  close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing  hopefully this will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely  second drop 00 pounds  cut out the weight work  third relax the wrists  will cost some power but until i can find my 0000 stroke concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up rolling the wrists through the strike zone and hit line drives  his strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park  if cansecos open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems hell be out of baseball in three years  if not he could still hit 000 hr        gary huckabay    you think thats loud enough ahole               movie rights    well if youre having trouble hearing it sir       available thru    id be happy to turn it up for you  i didnt           ted frank     know that many people your age liked kings x     
  for the second straight game california scored a ton of late runs to crush the brewhas it was six runs in the 0th for a 000 win monday and five in the 0th and six in the 0th for a 000 win yesterday jamie navarro pitched seven strong innings but orosco austin manzanillo and lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday hows this for numbers maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and navarros era is 000 the next lowest on the staff is wegman at 000 ouch  it doesnt look much better for the hitters hamilton is batting 000 while thon is hitting 000 and has seven rbi the next highest is three the next best hitter is jaha at 000 and then vaughn who has the teams only hr at 000 another ouch looking at the stats its not hard to see why the team is 00 in fact 00 doesnt sound bad when youre averaging three runsgame and giving up 00game   still its early and things will undoubtedly get better the offense should come around but the bullpen is a major worry fetters plesac and austin gave the brewers great middle relief last year lloyd maldanado manzanillo  fetters austin and orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place the starters will be okay the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around but the bullpen is a big question mark  in other news nilsson and doran were reactivated yesterday while william suero was sent down and tim mcintosh was picked up by montreal todays game with california was cancelled  salty

  heres my analysis of jose canseco circa sep 00 and jose canseco circa june 0000  0  hes bulked up too much  period  he needs to lose about 00 pounds     not gain more bulk  ive been saying that for at least 0 years now and even the as conditioning guru told jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his backalthough i dont for one second believe jose used steroidshis back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their framesee jeff bregel ex 00er as a textbook example and imho jose is too big for his frame   0  his bat speed has absolutely vanished  conservatively id say hes     lost 00 of his bat speed and thats a huge amount of speed  i cant imagine how to estimate bat speed but its pretty obvious that jose is missing fastballs he used to hit likely due to his back   0  that open stance is killing him   note that he acts sort of like     brian downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is     released  downing could do this without significant head movement      canseco cant  also note that canseco doesnt always close his     stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes     theyre fully closed  without a good starting point its hard     to make adjustments in your swing  i dont know he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the as and had no problems with it then it might be that preback problems he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused but now hes lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him the old saying if youre hot its a trigger mechanism if youre cold its a hitch   first minimize movement before the swing  close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing  hopefully this will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely  the biggest problem imho is he never has found a stance hes comfortable with for more than a few months he changes his stance so much he loses track of where the strike zone is in wednesdays night game he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me i think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because hes changed his stance so much  im also a bit concerned that because hes got palmer and gonzalez hitting all the homeruns hell become competitive swing even harder and screw himself up even worse larussa always said that cansecos famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits     russ smith  i dont know anything about xs but i know about some o                                 george gervin on being an assistant coach       
  robert c hite phillybachudeledu wrote  i think most of the problems mainly arose from manager gene mauchs  ineptitude in managing the pitching staff  down the stretch he  abused jim bunning chris short and robin roberts i think those  are the three pitching each on only 0 days rest for quite some  time  by the time they hit the last 0 weeks of the season  obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm  oh  well  roberts was long gone  he was probably an oriole in 0000  or maybe a colt 00  the 0rd starter was art mahaffey the previous years ace dennis bennett was the 0th starter  they were indeed 00 up with 00 to go but they won their final two games after the horrid 00loss streak  the final game victory bunnings 00th win if memory serves kept the reds from tying for the title they and the phils were both 0 game behind the cards with the giants another game back  the mets couldnt hold an early lead against the cards that final sunday or there would have been a 0way tie  too bad they couldnt have saved some of the 00 or so runs they scored on saturday when they crushed st louis   nealtravenpittedu      youre only young once but you can be travenvmscispittedu       immature forever    larry andersen

  substituting irony for brains bruce klopfenstein said  dtatepittedu david m tate writes   of course they left rbis off were comparing alomar the individual with  baerga the individual so only individual stats count    i forgot  most runs are scored by players stealing home so rbi dont count for anything  uh right  you also forgot that you cant get an rbi barring a hr with nobody on base  what fraction of all runs come on solo hr  most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the batter did something good  i use the phrase happened to be advisedly lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the most ability to turn it up a notch in clutchrbiwhatever situations and what theyve found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an ability to any measurable extent  there are no clutch hitters  people who tend to do things that would cause an rbi if there were somebody on base end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by being in position    my mistake  i agree  me too rbi are a worthless stat of course so is stolen bases because  sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run and of course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases so batting average slugging and obp out too  hmmm i guess homers would not count then either my point rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is and no stat or lack of can tell me there are no clutch hitters maybe no stat can tell me either but some people are i just know it 0  ed o     
   attn those who live inthe philadelphia metro area  back in september i was listening to wip and i remember the morning guys were talking with mayor ed rendell  the topic of conversation was a new ball park for the phillies  the location for this new park was suggested to be near 00th st station  at the time the mayor was optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality  has there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream i know the city of philadelphia has other projects ahead such as the new convention center and the upcoming spectrum ii  but it would be nice to see this a reality  it is planned that the phillies leave the vet and leave it solely to the eagles and if thats the case the eagles should make the vet a grass stadium but thats another story  i want to see that day  comments  
          hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves it  i     mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it  as    is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance or darrell    evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in  eddie    murray and jeff reardon  i am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and i can not without having stats to back up my points however i think you approached this the wrong way i believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman does i feel they were all much better players i am not saying i fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more   imho  dave kingman  definately not they guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag the rest of his career i do not think he was very feared by pitchers i also do not think he did a lot for the game i mean really i am a met fan  he was a met for part of his career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame  dave winfield  i think so he is feared by pitchers he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are in my opinion  without stats better than kingmans probably by quite a bit i also perceive him to be a leader maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader i think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done i know some of this from when he was with the yankees i think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the hall of fame i think it deserves some consideration  lee smith  maybe i would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of kingman  darrell evans  no  eddie murray  maybe he has had a very good career he is a leader although a silent one he is a good role model are the stats good enough i am not sure  but i would once again believe they are much better than kingmans both the average as well as the power numbers but not as good as winfields just think eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years  jeff reardon  my guess is no but it kind of depends on his numbers off the top of my head i would take lee smith first          well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody  giving    hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards  marginal    honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there theyre both    shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal    well i strongly disagree here both of these guys deserve it for sure i talked about leadership above both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers offensively the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop  he would have shattered aarons home run mark by now how many of those great plays saved games how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game while i believe both of these guys have numbers baseball is about more than numbers or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame as does george brett who also belongs in this class of player        lets be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors  so    liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if  something    isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when    certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential    candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to    the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan    steve garvey  i am not sure probably not but i guess i could see someone making a case for him   jack morris  once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up his name  kirby puckett  probably the only reason i do not say definately is he still has time left in his career if he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately  nolan ryan  is there really any doubt i think i heard something about him having some 00 records maybe they were not all good  i dont know i did not hear any of them just the number he has the numbers he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model i would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top 00 but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of his accomplishments nohitters strikeouts respectable numbers  even with some weaker teams you can go on and on i really hope he gets all the possible votes  so in summing up i have 0 groups those that belong those that probably do but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying dont belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go  yes   winfield yount brettnot in your mail o smith puckett and ryan maybe  murray and l smith no  reardon garvey morris evans and definately kingman  as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this up  these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions  mike

  second basemen in history he probably didnt even have as good a season as alomar last year  guess which line is which baobpslgabh0b0bhrbb x000000000000000000000 y0000000000000000000000  the walks should give it away  obps in general somewhat more valuable than slugging and alomars edge in obp was quite a bit larger than baergas edge in slugging  im no sdcn but whats more valuable  00 hits w0 more doubles 00 more hrs   or 0 more triples and 00 bbs  lets not forget the 00 extra sbs how many cs  of course the 00 hits and 00 homers are more valuable  but dont forget the 00 outs  you cant have it both ways baergas higher raw numbers are due to him having more playing time and thus he had more hits and homers but dont forget the cost of those outs  btw just to answer your question alomar had 00 sb and 0 cs baerga had 00 sb and 0 cs which gives a minute plus on alomars side  something else to consider  alomars hr splits were 000000 slg 000000 obp baergas was 000000 and 000000 pretty clearly alomar got a huge boost from his home park  id say you could make a good for them being about equal right now tp rated baerga higher actually  mike   disclaimer  these opiinihh damn hh q   w  q  wq  wq d  x  exit x q  c  quitbye  ctrlaltdel   q  q  logout  savequit quit zz zzzzzz vi  man vi   l  c   e x i t  help  helpquit d  d  man help c c e help exit quit q ctrlshftdel hey what does stop l0a d

      alomar fans left rbi fans and runs off this list because they are dependant  on the team to a large extent if frank thomas hit first hed lose a lot  of rbis and anyways how many 0nd place hitters have you known to drive  in 000 runs doesnt happen that oftenvery unlikely with devon whites  000 obp in front of you im pretty sure that sandberg has done this at least once  i know someone will correct me if im wrong    rbis and runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics  you can talk about obp and slg all you want but the fact remains  the team that scores more runs wins the game   flame away   john bratt       gord niguma  fav player john olerud    
   joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball    for anyone who didnt see sundays game    with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed  hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers    later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts  lankford a 000 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis  alicea a 000 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  what the hell  is he thinking  educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year lankford injured himself in a previous game and torre was resting him  as far as the whittengilkey controversy  whitten adds some more needed power and if jordan continues to hit the way he has been gilkey will find himself in the starting lineup soon enough  sam    brian landmann                                              georgia institute of technology                             internetgt0000aprismgatechedu

        actually i kind of liked the abott trade we did trade the rookie of   the year snow but with don mattingly at first for another 0 years why   bother  id be willing to make two wagers 0 snow doesnt win roy 0 mattingly is out of baseball within five years  im skeptical of the first because i dont think snow is that good a player and he is on a losing team  im skeptical of the second because of his back  mattingly is 00 this year and how many players play until they are 00  not too many and most of them didnt have chronic back problems when they were 00  could be wrong on either or both but i think thats the smart way to bet  cheers valentine

   my point rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is and no stat or lack of can tell me there are no clutch hitters maybe no stat can tell me either but some people are i just know it 0  i was hoping somebody would mention clutch  clutch  baerga  the two words simply do not go together  with runners in scoring position baerga batted 000000000 last year  this doesnt quite suck but most batters hit better in this situation  alomar  he hit 000000000 with runners in scoring position  the difference  alomar had 00 rbis in 000 such ab  baerga had 00 rbis in 000 such ab  baerga got 00 more chances yet succeeded only 00 more times  frankly i dont believe in clutch  but if i did my vote would go to alomar for mvp let alone best 0b in the al  valentine  
  steve tomassi writes        hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves it i mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon  unfortunately you seem to lack the ability to rate players  dave winfield has had a better career than half the people in the hall of fame  eddie murray and darrel evans are both one of the top 000 players of all time  lee smith has had probably the greatest long career of any relief pitcher since 0000 with the possible exception of gossage  on the other hand kingman probably isnt one of the best 000 players of all time  and reardon though a good pitcher isnt in smiths class career wise       well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards marginal  honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there theyre both shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal  were talking 0 of the top 00 players of all time here  there probably arent 0 shortstops in history who were better than these two       lets be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent  garvey sucked  morris while a very good pitcher simply doesnt belong near cooperstown   gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan  if puckett and ryan okay no if there get into to the hall they will be  marginal hall of famers unless puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for a while longer  to put this in perspective heres a listing of the linear weights values of the careers of the players you mention  in parenthesis is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it while no one would claim these are perfect rankings they should give you a good value of these guys careers as compared to average players  robin yount 000 00 ozzie smith 000 00 dave winfield 000 00 eddie murray 000 00 darrel evans 000 00 kirby puckett 000 000 nolan ryan 000 000 jack morris 000 000 dave kingman 00  steve garvey 00  to give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the hall of the 00 eligible players whose career stats equaled 000 00 are in the hall of fame the ones who arent include 0 00th century players ron santo bobby grich and bob johnson  of those eligible who score between 000 and 000 00 of 00 are in  of those eligible who score between 000 and 000 00 of 00 are in    greg   
  in a philadelphia inquirer a few days ago it was reported that there were two 0 plans for a new phillies stadium  the alreadymentioned 00th street station proposal and a location near broad street and race street i think  i cant remember the exact details but the stadium would be build practically downtown  there is a small lot that could be used according to the paper  the 00th street plan has run into some trouble because amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to accomodate the stadium  i dont have an opinion just yet just letting everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon however because nobody wants to pay for it        keith kellerlets go rangers lets go quakers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs              when i want your opinion ill give it to you   
  can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make absolutely no sense  at least in the local gannett rag that finds its way to my door  i must have stared at cleman in the mets box for a good 00 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was  wouldnt it make more sense to use colemn  jay  
  one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasnt yet been addressed  i believe the rule also does not deal with this situation  if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught runners can tag up and advance at their own risk as on any fly ball  however if the infield fly is not caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base wo fear of being doubled off for advancing too early  when the ball hits the ground  when a fielder first touches the ball after it hits the ground  enlightenment would be appreciated  jay     
   baseball players past and present  we werent able to come up  with much except for sandy koufax somebody stankowitz and  maybe john lowenstein  can anyone come up with any more  i know  it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but  humor us  thanks for your help     john lowenstein is definately not jewish  many in baltimore thought he was especially after he told the baltimore jewish times sobut later he admitted that it was a joke

  yeah the phillies played over their heads almost the whole year but it all caught up to them in one 00game streak i am as old as 0000 man and i was a big phillies fan at the time age 00    the dodgers or somebody else finish two games back that has to be one of the closest last minute scrambles ever  since i was born in the late pleistocene i too remember 0000  that year the dodgers were several games out of first and i think finished sixth in the league  this was kind of odd because they won the world series both the previous year and the following year       warren usui  im one with the universe  on a scale from 0 to 00   
  previously i wrote  yeah the phillies played over their heads almost the whole year but it all caught up to them in one 00game streak i am as old as 0000 man and i was a big phillies fan at the time age 00 september 00 is still a painful thing to remember but i can tell you that the phillies never led the league by 00 that year going by memory alone i believe their biggest lead was 0 00 games and they were 0 00 ahead when the famous 00game losing streak began a streak during which it seemed that they found just about every way to lose known to man anyway i think they rebounded just before the end and won their last couple games and were still in the thing until the final day but finished tied with the giants one game out and didnt the dodgers or somebody else finish two games back that has to be one of the closest last minute scrambles ever  ok you guys stirred up my childhood memories so i went and did some research on the final month or so of the 0000 season it turns out that my

were really overused at least by the fourman rotation standard of the day until well along into the 00game losing streak at which time mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the phillies substantial lead had evaporated the way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse although bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 000 shutout of the reds that cost the reds a share of the pennant bunning pitched a complete game sixhitter striking out five and walking one it would be inetersting to see though how the total innings for the year for bunning and short stacks up against the rest of the league also notice that the phillies played every day from at least september 0 through october 0 while they didnt play substantially more games than the other teams the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch   eric smith ericsnetcomcom ericsinfoservcom ci 000000000

  rbis and runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics  you can talk about obp and slg all you want but the fact remains  the team that scores more runs wins the game   flame away  so what does that have to do with rbis  the team with the most rbis doesnt necessarily win the game  yes runs are the most important statistice  for a team  so why does every newspaper rank team offense by batting average  but for an individual player runs and rbis are contextdependent and tell us very little about the player himself and more about his teammates and position in the batting order   ted frank                   thf0kimbarkuchicagoedu          im sorry the card says moops the u of c law school       standard disclaimers

  i love it how all of these people are blaming the phillies success  on a weak division  why dont we look at the record of the teams in  each division read interdivisional play well see that the east  is really kicking the shit out of the west  i know it is early but  that is all we have to go on  atlanta is just so strong with their  000 ba cincinnati is 00 coming off a sweep at veterans stadium in  philadelphia and houston was swept in its first three games by the  phillies in the astrodome  that my western division friends shows  that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you  think  phils all the way in 00 braves hit like a aaa club reds need marge  bob  
  i have noticed that this year has had a lot of high scoring games at least the nl has  i believe one reason are the expansion teams  any thoughts   charles  
  gt0000aprismgatechedu brian r landmann writes   joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball  for anyone who didnt see sundays game  with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers  later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a 000 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea a 000 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  what the hell is he thinking  for your information lankford is injured i think it is his shoulder or rib cage so he could not use him as a pinch hitter   earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said he liked gilkey coming off the bench  gilkey hit over 000 last year what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every team in the league  i do believe that whiten was a very good aquisition for the cards  he does not have too much offensive capabilities but he is an awesome defensively since when have the cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense i forgot who st louis gave up for him but it was not too much   as far as gilkey is concerned he is a leftfielder and so is brian jordan who beat him out  i expect to see a gilkeyjordan platoon in lf   furthermore in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home  i agree with you on this one  as soon as larkin threw that ball i knew that lankford was a dead bird  but how could dent have known that larkin would make a perfect throw   i strongly believe that torre is one of the best managers in baseball  dont forget the overachieving cards of 00 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place although they were oveshadowed by the braves twins last to first climb  he won a division title and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the braves why atlanta ever even considered firing him i will never understand  with torre at the controls the cardinals are heading in the right direction   one more thing one game does not make a season  yes they lost to the reds but with the second best pitching staff in the national league first in the east and a pretty good offense the redbirds will win a lot more than they lose  maybe this is the year that they will go all the way   charles a very enthusiastic cardnials fan        º charles rosen            º      thirtyfour to thirteen    º   º university of alabama    º   national champs  roll tide º   º tuscaloosa al           º         need i say more         º

     not clear to me at all  id certainly rather have a team who was winning  00 games than 00 games  in the 00 game luck is going to play a much  bigger role than in the 00 game   but you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to one run  sam    sherri nichols  snicholsadobecom

  was going over some videos last night   and you wrote an excellent report about it   0  hes bulked up too much  period  he needs to lose about 00 pounds     not gain more bulk  0  his bat speed has absolutely vanished  conservatively id say hes     lost 00 of his bat speed and thats a huge amount of speed  0  that open stance is killing him   note that he acts sort of like     brian downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is     released  downing could do this without significant head movement      canseco cant  also note that canseco doesnt always close his     stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes     theyre fully closed  without a good starting point its hard     to make adjustments in your swing   i understand from an unreliable source that canseco was considered expendable by the as when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance  the as brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated if not caused by having a wide open stance closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque thats a paraphrase of what i remember  in any event canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance and the as began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power    aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch so that id never have to work again id restructure my entire swing  apparently you sound like larussa  second drop 00 pounds  cut out the weight work  the as also objected about this   if cansecos open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems hell be out of baseball in three years  if not he could still hit 000 hr  again im just repeating something i heard  but possibly the cause and effect is the reverse of that      the beastmaster     mark singer     mssnetcomcom

   no hes not nuts wip is second to none the sports station  they dont have tony bruno working espn radio and al morganti doing friday night hockey because they suck  i live in richmond va but i visit phila often and on the way i get wtem washington and wip  i hear the fan at night wherever i go the signal used to be wnbc when they played golden oldies because you cant avoid it  of those three wip has the best hosts hands down  chuck cooperstein isnt a homer and neither is jody mac  wtem is too generic to be placed in the catergory  in fact if you have heard wtem and the fan you notice the theme music is identicalsame ownership i think so  wip is totally original  their hosts actually have a personality this is a knock at tem the team not the fan because mike and the mad dog and sommers are good i mean comparing the morning guys in philadelphia to the ones in washington is a total joke  anyway i like the fan and wip but i think the edge goes to ip    when i get back from philly i go into withdraw cause richmond has nada except the national sports line and those guys are totally clueless    i was really mad when wcau was cancelled because they had steve fredericks doing sports phone after the phillies games  wcau is another strong station now its an oldies station but they still have the phillies i started listening to the fan because i heard he went there  i finally heard him last summer and he wasnt the same guy  those ny fans got to him  i was glad to hear him back in philly when i went to see a few eagles games     i will admit i am  die hard eagles fan and wip is basically an eagles station 000 days a year  but i bet you the phillies are in control right now   about the knock on g cobb i like him  he knows the eagles like a book  i remember the weekend before they went to play san fran when everyone thought the eagles would be blown away cobb said that the eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win well they were inches shy of pulling the victory    well thats my 00  
   since someone brought up sports radio howabout sportswriting  anyone give an opinion   which city do you think has the best sports coverage in terms of print media   these are general questions   is the washington post better than the philadelphia inquier or the ny times    howabout the philadelphia daily news compared to the new york daily news     do you notice papers being subjective or objective to the home team   
   something else to consider  alomars hr splits were 000000 slg 000000 obp baergas was 000000 and 000000 pretty clearly alomar got a huge boost from his home park  not necessarily  it could mean that or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road see frank thomas homeroad splits in 00 for an example  i would guess that some of alomars split is due to the skydome but most of it is probably due just to coincidence theres no way to be sure of course but the only hitters the skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters and alomar is not a home run hitter  id say you could make a good for them being about equal right now tp rated baerga higher actually  only because of tps bogus fielding stats which rate alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league  on a career basis i think tps fielding stats may mean something but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this  alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is but he sure isnt the worst in baseball  offensively tp rate alomar much higher last year  regarding the a vs b argument ill just say theyre both very good players with different strengths and a bright future   greg

   i dont have a history handy but i dont recall that the preponderance of roys come from winning teams  in fact i think team performance is generally irrelevant as almost always the most deserving candidate wins am i wrong  not really though i wouldnt personally say the most deserving candidate wins  rarely does a player win roy when called up in mid season and there have been several duds in recent years  but this is more a factor of mediot biases than anything else  i wonder  if amaral hits like he is capable of will he receive roty votes  hes only 00 he could have a long career ahead of him    and he is not necessarily on a losing team  while the angels staff is still very weak their everyday lineup is doing quite well thank you  snow is playing great  salmon is learning to make the adjustments easley appears fine but even if hes not flora is ready to come up between gonzales and gruber theyll manage the hot corner  polonia and curtis are steady and heady  even myers and orton are contributing  personally i think they can finish over 000 which makes them a  winning team  i think they are a seconddivision team  they should finish ahead of the royals mariners and possibly athletics  but i dont think theyll be above 000  i think the east is stronger this year  last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible  this year their offense is better but their pitching is still pretty bad even if finley returns to form he wont replace what they lost in abbott  sanderson  farrell  i dont believe it  and while their ba may be good and they have decent speed their offense lacks punch  they dont have any bona fide power hitters salmon snow davis and curtis  none with more than 00 hr potential  cheers valentine  ps which al team had the most steals last week  those gogo tigers the mediots finally managed to convince them that they needed more balance in their lineup  you see they were scoring too many runs too consistently  gotta run more to break that up

     not clear to me at all  id certainly rather have a team who was winning  00 games than 00 games  in the 00 game luck is going to play a much  bigger role than in the 00 game   but you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to one run  yeah but whats your point  you still need the offense to score more runs than you allow too    the braves do have a fine pitching staff  but thats still only half the game    sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

    i agree though id also be happy with a stadium that looks  like new comiskey the new park was also made for baseball  unlike three rivers the vet riverfront etc its not a  football park in which they also play baseball   while were on the multipurpose subject lets not forget shea which was designed to accommodate both the mets  jets  it was the first stadium i think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football  of course with the jets gone to jersey and a truly good football stadium the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where because its circular the seats are almost always too far from the action  the mets announcerskiner  murphy in particularhave always hyped it as beautiful shea stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is  jay

    the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to death but i havent seen anything in rsb yet  gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run  he stroked a line drive into the right field corner  the ball cleared the threefoot high fence and went into the crowd  darryl racing over from right center got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he missed the ball  a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt reached up and caught the ball  home run  now ive seen the replay several times and i have concluded that darryl missed the ball and that the fans glove was essentially behind darryls  several dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with strawberry  what cannot be disputed however is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing  he was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch  that exuberance disappeared immediately however when strawberry went into a tirade at the man  all reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of costing the dodgers a game  shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch  dodger stadium officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and just relocated him to another area  in an interview after the game lasorda blamed the fan for the loss  strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they dont care about  winning  la times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch  before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play  was the fan wrong  should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference  or was he human and just reacting  by the way he is a season ticket holder and on his request the dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the stadium where future interference is impossible  others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 0 rbi through the first nine games  i question what he was doing in right center with a lefthanded pull hitter up and the game on the line  had he been closer to the play he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball  but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan    the beastmaster      mark singer     mssnetcomcom  
  went to the dodgers game tonight  it was cap night   astacio pitched ok but had control trouble all night in the first he walked a batter balked him to second then a single scored the run with the batter taking second on the throw home  another single made the score 00 cards   lasorda tried a new line up featuring butler reed and piazza batting third  darryl and eric were benched in favor of snyder and webster   piazza homered in the first to make the score 00 cards the dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by offerman   by the fourth inning astacio had already made about 00 pitches but the score was still 00  the dodger defense made several impressive plays  piazza looked great behind the plate gunning down a runner trying to steal second throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base etc   karros also made a spectacular play keeping a ball from going into the outfield  the runner on first was so sure that ball was going through he just kept running past second  karros got up and threw to third and easily got the runner at third   my heart sank in the 0th when gross got up to warm up in the bullpen   astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter and when gross entered the game with the score still 00 dodger fans just knew it was over   gross was relieving because he stunk on tuesday pitching just 0 00 innings forcing lasorda to use much of his bullpen  the 00 inning game had the same effect the next nightso only gross was fresh given his light work out tuesday   gross lived up to his name  he walked the first batter gave up a hit to the second and walked the bases loaded  after a grounder resulted in a force at home zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 00 cards  gross paid little attention to the runners and the next thing you knew the cards had stolen a fourth run  the runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down but the 0th run had scored long before that   meanwhile the dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning lee smith pitched the ninth  he had little trouble getting karros and wallach does anyone have trouble with wallach these days cory snyder collected his first hit as a dodger a single but that was all the offense the dodgers could mount  smith got his third straight save against the dodgers and all i got was my free dodger cap and a good look at piazza  if piazza keeps this up all year he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors  though its really early karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year   the final scorecardinals 0 runs on 0 hits dodgers 0 runs on 0 hits   dodger

bear with me  in the bigs especially when they havent even played aaa ball  we certainly believe this kid is going to be very good some day but there is really no need to rush him especially since we have a mega million dollar staff that is probably well served by a batterymate who is expereienced in game calling and pitcher handling  lopez time will come  lets give him some time in aaa   javy lopez has proven over 0000 ab in the minor leagues that he is ready to play in the majors he is not being rushed players who are clearly too good for aa and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them at aaa  no  maybe i need to improve my writing skills  lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age 00   unless lopez is me defensively im 00 000 and born to play second base  he belongs in the major leagues  training  what does he have to do to earn a chance  maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth  gee  i dont know  00 abs sounds pretty good to me  about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a backup role rather than start every day at aaa  talk about me as a gm  valentine isnt saying he should back up hes saying he should be put in a position to win the job in the major leagues which imho he would if given the opportunity val if im misinterpreting please let me know  so far you have come up with two arguments against lopez 0 he is very ordinary defensively 0 he is young and most players suck when they are young  the first is irrelevant  hes trying to make the majors with his bat and the second involves seriously warped reasoning  valentine  ok  most players are not ready for the bigs at age 00 see current related posting on clayton one of my favorites  most players  benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs  those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year  but the players who are ready are 0the best and 0 the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors javy lopez is not a middle oftheroad prospect hes the real thing now   again the most important thing a player can do is hit lopez does that miles better than olson or berryhill if his defense is good enough for greenville or richmond its good enough for atlanta if he really was awful defensively he would no longer be a catcher see sprague ed  now  the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners  not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops  the center field platoon will probably hit 000  however good lopez what they have to offset the differential in experience and  defensive ability  the kid will improve playing at aaa and he probably wont being a reserve with the big club    oh where to start ok first of all solid  good i want good players solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really arent very good at baseball think of it as twg without the caps its a losing strategy to say we have solid guys we dont need to improve you used it four times in that paragraph btw  same for experienced i might add though that greg olson and damon berryhill arent exactly carter and fisk olson has played three years berryhill five although 00 and 00 were a wash the only difference imho between olson and valle is the supporting cast  two big bats hrm i like justice but i find mr gants trend disturbing call it one and a maybe the braves platoon is ok but neither player has any value outside of the platoon bream vs lh and hunter vs rh are awful ill leave the thirdbase comment alone pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already if the cf platoon hits 000 ill retrace mr likhanis midnight run down forbes and i live in ny and la got that mike  and doesnt cox call pitches anyway  goodness  do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential why on earth do you people thinkthe braves made this decision are they idiots who have built this ballclub  jeeeesh  nope theyre baseball management possible the most shortsighted  collection of people in the nation do you not believe this goes on mark do you think frank thomas needed those three months in aaa in 0000 or cal eldred wasnt really better than ricky bones last year  and im the treasure  youre mostly polite make defensible if flawed

  a lot of teams carry 0 catchers on their 00 man roster but the 0rd catcher is seldom ever used  he is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 0nd catcher is injured during a game     so to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever why not invoke a catcher resubstitution rule  if the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game     given this rule a team wouldnt need 0 roster catchers  the 0rd catcher could be playing in aaa or be a nonroster bullpen catcher  ken

   not at all  i am talking about morris winning with toronto last year  you  are about to launch into a fantasy about the red jays and how toronto would have done with viola on their team  viola didnt play for toronto  last year  morris did  the problem with your nihilistic approach roger is that it takes all the sense out of the game  by your line of reasoning if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded theres no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do if his team won anyway or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons  after all any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didnt  roger do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead  or are you willing to consider empirical evidence  teams go to the postseason when they win more games than anybody else in their division  if they dont make the postseason they dont win the series  will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ringcollecting  if so you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games  in your viewpoint as expressed winning games happens for reasons that cannot be analyzed  while many of us are thinking things like base runners are good outs are bad and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded you are thinking things like its a team game so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today  the result is that it becomes impossible to say anything about individual players  perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me playing left field  after all perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it  therefore i could be an extremely valuable player  did dave winfield have anything to do with the jays victory  probably but how do you know if you replace him with andres galarraga perhaps the jays would have won perhaps they would have lost perhaps they would have defected to alpha centauri bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in midseason had winfield been dhing for toronto  was babe ruth a good player  he played on some wswinning teams but did he have anything to do with their success  it is generally accepted that ernie banks was a good baseball player and jarvis brown and dan schatzeder werent  it seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof  now we have observed things about baseball over the years both empirically and by looking at the rulebook  it is necessary to score more runs than ones opponent to win the game so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent ones opponent from scoring  runs are scored while a team is batting and an inning ends after the third out so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good  players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year  we do use these statistics to predict winners and so do you  to make some flat predictions  barry bonds will have a higher obpslg than gene larkin this year  the braves will finish ahead of the rockies in the standings  the tigers will score more runs than the royals but will also give up more  i would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false and i suspect so would you  as a matter of fact i am pretty sure i can predict all the division winners this year given 00 guesses per division and this is certainly better than random chance and almost statistically significant  if you will admit that the rockies and mariners are unlikely to meet in the world series you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods however fuzzy  it is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally meaningless  so how about real life  person a robs a service station with two people in it using a 00 automatic pistol gets 00 and is convicted and sentenced for three years  person b with a similar criminal record robs a service station with two people in it using a 00 revolver gets 00 and is convicted  since they used two different types of handgun are comparisons totally meaningless  say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works my cats are always testing this  they dont trust me to pay the gravity bill on time  you have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before so all previous evidence is meaningless  or would you be surprised if it flew out the window instead of hitting the desk  david thornley who has no replica world series rings but does have tickets to the 0000 world series in the metrodome

  kubeysgicom ken kubey said  i suppose a foul ball machine like brett butler is pretty valuable but id rather watch and root for the lower obp guys who can actually hit the ball  now this is a legitimate point  baseball is entertainment and i have no quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than others regardless of their winvalue  personally im a huge fan of the slugbunt i doubt its a highpercentage play but i get a big kick out of it  i am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun  of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that galarragas inability to defer gratification isnt hurting his team because he isnt paid to walk or is an rbi guy or whatever  and finally id like to point out that many high obp guys draw  their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them than because they have a great eye  im not sure  i used to think this was true but more and more im becoming convinced that its the other way around among players with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard the patient ones are the ones who get the chance to do it a lot  lets break down the four basic categories of hitter according to whether they are power threats and whether they walk a lot   powerno power  patientfrank thomasbrett butler barry bondsozzie smith mark mcgwirecraig grebeck babe ruthmiller huggins ted williamsbilly hamilton rickey hendersoneddie joost joe morganmike hargrove                       impatienternie banksozzie guillen dave kingmanshawon dunston joe carterandres thomas george belljose lind kirby puckettdevon white etc  as far as i can tell all the categories are full  it really looks like the two are independent  nobody could possibly be afraid of craig grebeck at the plate and yet he walks quite a lot  part of that undoubtedly is being small of stature but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of  target at least 0 times out of 0  randy milligan is an even better example hes only shown noticeable power for one partial season but he walks all over the place despite his huge strike zone        david m tate   dtatepittedu   greetings sir with bat not quick       member iie orsa tims sabr      hands not soft eye not discerning                                        and in denver they call you a slugger    the big catullus galarraga        and compare you to my own mattingly

  nichols writes in article 00000newsdukeedu fierkelabbchmbiochemdukeedu eric roush writes that hed been thrown out  and gant had a legitimate beef about the 00 pitch that was called a strike  a reasonable umpire would not have tried to force gant back into the box in that situation  a reasonable umpire would do as hes been instructed to do this season get the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous length of games  i for one am glad to see this happen and hope more umpires will do as hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if the batter wont get back in the box    so what if the previous strike call was bogus  its in the past it cant be changed get back in there and deal with the next pitch    sorry sherri but i cant agree with this particular incident  while im all for cutting down the number of chainrattles and other examples of rampant hargroving there was a difference here  0  since time immemorial batters have complained about calls so have pitchers and catchers  usually nothing happens unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints hirschbeck was acting against expectations  0  its not as if gant was in hirschbecks face  gant said something about the call stepped out of the box and turned away from hirschbeck  as a hitter alibet of little consequence but with a decent eye whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call id want a moment or two out of the box if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch  and if i was really angry at the ump id rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed especially at a key moment in the game  when gant turned away hirschbeck immediately motioned for gant to step into the box  imo at this point in time hirschbeck was determined to show gant exactly who was in charge of this game gant wasnt dawdling he hadnt had a chance to dawdle  and hirschbeck was simply exercising a power play  gant resisted as many of us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request and hirschbeck called for the pitch  at that point cox came out on the field the pitch was thrown and many other braves left the dugout  cox was tossed protecting his player  i was pleasantly surprised that gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game  its a small sample size but based on what i saw in that game mark hirschbeck has a hairtrigger temper and a need to play god on the field  not good qualities for an umpire  i will keep my eyes open for future appearances of hirschbeck in the  future in order to improve my sample size  imo any game where you remember the name of the umpire was a bad game for the umpire  eric roush  
   we cannot isolate the total contribution that any player at any position makes to his teams victory  and since we cannot make that measure with complete confidence of objectivity and since there is no absolutely  necessary reason to make that kind of subjective measurement i submit to  you that it is pointless  if a gm is trying to put together a winning team he might consider era he might consider attitude he might consider past performance in key situations  but what he is looking for is not  the player that he considers the best  the gm is looking for the player he thinks can help his team win  we cannot isolate completely roger but we can make a pretty good estimate i wont claim to split hairs and say that we can really measure who was better robby alomar or carlos baerga last year the difference is too close to call but larkin and lee clemens and morris the differences are too great there  in your measure of the game why should a team that has just won it all ever replace a single player since they are now clearly best how can they do better yet every team can always find someplace where they beleive they can improve the team they can always find a player a little better than one they already have btw by my definitions the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team win i will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team by having aptitudes one team needs more than others  baseball is a team game but it is made of individual talents it is absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success or failure of his teammates whom he did not choose at least in most cases morris won last year because he played on a team with joe carter robby alomar tom henke juan guzman john olerud et al clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as herm winninham luis rivera and jeff reardon to define the quality of the team as a sum of its components as i do albeit imperfectly is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the mean quality of the team as my reading of your arguments suggests you do  clay d

   a reasonable umpire would do as hes been instructed to do this season get the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous length of games  i for one am glad to see this happen and hope more umpires will do as hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if the batter wont get back in the box     a reasonable umpire would have recognized that ron gant was  disturbed with the call  a reasonable umpire would have realized that there was a 0run game in progress with two outs in the ninth  what ron gant did was try to regain his composure  what a normal baseball player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument with the umpire and since you cant argue balls and strikes he would have been ejected from the game  ron gant by trying to avoid such a conflict was penalized for showing some restraint  incidentally a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire as gant requested  if the home plate umpire had appealed to first the first base umpire could have wrung up the strike and gant would not have been so upset  if the call had been a ball and the catcher had requested the appeal it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help  finally the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the socalled efforts to speed up the game  the game was played very quickly it was just at 0 hours when the stuff happened in the ninth and the only delays in the entire game had been the result of actions by the umpires other than deion having to clean garbage off the field    econdukeedu     flsecondukeedu     flsecondukeedu    flseconduke s  to my correspondents  my email has been changed                       e l                         my new address is  flsecondukeedu            d f            if mail bounces try flsraphaelacpubdukeedu               u

   cox shouldve protested the game the second time the garbage got thrown at his outfielders  he should also have protested the game at the point where ron gant was assessed the second strike in the ninth on the grounds that he cox was on the field and time should have been called  both protests would be denied of course  the umpires judgement determines the garbage thing although i think the game should be called but thats my personal opiniondoesnt matter  there is time only when the ump says so the second argument is baseless   dave  
  the situation with the giants bleachers is a case in point for the need for a commissioner  this is true but the main thing the commish ie selig needs to do is to suspend bobby cox  you cannot allow a team to come out at the ump as the braves did  i usually rip umps but in this case the players were dead wrong  cox should go for 0 games  if i had ever umped a game where that happened id have ejected every player that came out  only cox and gant would have been spared and then cox would have gone in the ensuing argument  dave   
  btw by my definitions the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team win i will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team by having aptitudes one team needs more than others  well then given your definition of best is it not conceivable that alfredo griffin could bring something to a team that that team needs to win while larkin might not have that something the team needs  no  i do not find this conceivable  i also cannot conceive of the possibility that there is any hypothetical team which morris would help more than clemens  would griffin then be better than larkin  given your premise yes  but you are alone in your ability to conceive of that premise  valentine

  o any of you experts want to analyze ron gant is his early season slump because he is still swinging his bat the way he was last year trying to hit to all fields etc or has he changed his swing back to the old gant and is just in a small early season slump  is his spot int he lineup even secure especially the way he has been hitting    msilvermnyxcsduedugo cubs  one likes to believe in the freedom of baseball  geddy lee  
  does anybody know what is going on with lankford i know he was out for a few games with a slight injury but since he has beenback and before the injury for that matter he has been really struggling at the plate and on the basepaths  whereis the ray lankford we saw last year    msilvermnyxcsduedugo cubs  one likes to believe in the freedom of baseball  geddy lee  
  i always thought that a reasonable means of measuring value between players was to attempt to determine if a team would trade one for another  the major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age  even if morris were performing as well as clemens right now and were likely to this season nobody would trade clemens for morris straight up because clemens has more of his career left  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

      i suppose a foul ball machine like brett butler is pretty valuable    but id rather watch and root for the lower obp guys who can    actually hit the ball  and id rather watch and root for a team that scores lots of runs and wins games  of course im rooting for the rockies and andres anyway  but thats for irrational hometown reaons  i also root for frank thomas   david paschich

cs000000arielyorkuca shawn luddington writes hey valentine i dont see boston with any world series rings on their fingers yah  so damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his  future he certainly didnt earn his last one  how many games did he blow in the world series  all of the ones he started he certainly did earn it  he was a valuable member of the blue jay team   not particularly in the world series during the season he was probably more valuable than say putting olerud out there to pitch but yeah he was valuable in getting them there in the postseason he sucked dirty canal water through a straw the jays won in spite of morris much more than because of him  therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing oh yes  definitely  therefore morris is better than clemens your definition of better refers to some measurement on a scale that has nothing to do with winning ws rings  umm roger return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago where the poster valentine was replying to used  of ws rings as a measure of better the concept is called context and you should really become familiar with it someday  the facts are that morris has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a ws winning club clemens hasnt  unless this transaltes to clemens hasnt gone into lou gormans office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until hed been traded to the jays im at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it  you can go on about what clemens has done in the  past and claim that he is better than morris if you want to  but  the facts are that morris has shown us that he can win and clemens hasnt  what on earth does this mean over their careers clemens has won 00 of the games hes started morris 00 per year clemens has averaged nearly 00 wins morris just under 00 would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game if so then consider that clemens allows 00 runs0 innings pitched morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings in fact jack morris has never in his career had an era for a single year as good as clemens career era but i forget in the maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to buckner missing that grounder in 0000 had morris been on the sox it would have been a routine groundout right  whether or not clemens is better by your standard of measurement is totally meaningless  the object of the game is not to compile  high figures in statistics that you have chosen to feel are important the object of the game is to contribute to ws victories  but this has been patiently explained to you many many times and you are  either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it  speaking of stupid it has been patiently and notsopatiently explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask  dont give me that shit  if boston had alomar olerud henke and ward while toronto had rivera jack clark jeff reardon things would have looked a little different last fall  give credit where credit is due  this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick yes and the dog would have caught the rabbit tooforget about what didnt happen and open your eyes for once and look out there and see what is really happening  forget about how morris shouldnt have won 00 with an era over 0   when morris pitched last year the jays won  stop crying about it and get on with life  no one is crying the jays won and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the al east they performed well in two short series and won the world series and i congratulate them for it as a red sox fan i hope they keep morris i was happy when they picked up stewart and elated when they traded for darrin jackson you see unless you believe in some mystical link between morris and the offense you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky luck runs out just like it did in 0000 when he pitched 00odd more innings than 0000 gave up exactly one earned run more than in 0000 and went 0000  seriously roger id really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 0000 morris and the 0000 morris which one was a better pitcher and why did morris somehow learn how to win in the intervening ten years if so then why did he go 0000 in 0000 with minnesota with an era over half a run lower than 0000   mike jones  aix highend development  mjonesdonaldaixkingstonibmcom  dont be humble youre not that great

  maynardramseycslaurentianca roger maynard writes it sure does  and it all depends on the definition that you use for better yours is based on what could have been and mine is based on what really happened  well actually most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened but thats ok i understand you have a hockey background stats like plusminus make rbi look good  is it violas fault that boston had no offense  is it because of morris that the blue jays had such a strong offense  dont tell me that morris has this magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs this is the perfect example of your problem  you are isolating violas contribution from the rest of the teams efforts  you can only do this if you can say for sure what the team would have done without  viola  only then can you compare  but you cannot know how the team would have done without viola  your analysis is fallacious  ok how about a straigh answer then heres a very simele question to which im sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to please answer yes or no roger  can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs al only please  for anyone else following along it is a wellknown and demonstrable fact that a teams winloss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows its not a definite hardandfast function but there is definitely a correlation in fact as a rule of thumb if teams a and b both score x runs and team a allows y runs for every 00 runs fewer than y that team b allows it will win another game so for instance if we look at the 0000 toronto blue jays we find that they scored 000 runs and allowed 000 of which morris allowed 000 all other things being equal if frank viola with his 000 era had replaced jack morris for the 0000 innings morris threw plausible since viola threw 000 for boston the red jays would have allowed about 00 fewer runs or enough for 00 more wins now that doesnt take into account that viola pitched half his innings in fenway which is a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander than skydome so um roger unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that viola would necessarily have put up a 000 if he had been on the jay last year but that is not the claim we look at what the actual performances were and evaluate violas as better than morris in the sense that had morris performed as viola did his team would have been better off  it takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out here in the real world guys  this is true but not so open that your brain falls out   mike jones  aix highend development  mjonesdonaldaixkingstonibmcom  computerif you dont open that exit hatch this moment i shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large ax got that  zaphod beeblebrox  
   yes  everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are  finally moving in the right direction  they should finish over 000 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race  in august  however i would take back a few moves  0  the jim abbott trade     i think abbott is not only an inspirational person but a     great pitcher also  he could win the cy young this year      but he wont because the right side of the yanks infield     isnt good enough  so why was this not a good trade       jt snow  how many rookies have been able to step in and     immediately have the impact that he has had so far on      the angels  i know its early but if youve seen this kid     hit field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be      a tremendous player  the yanks should have kept him  what     about mattingly you ask  well  its great that the yanks     have taken care of him and remained loyal but hes 00 years     older than snow and just doesnt have the same bat speed as     before his back injury  its a shame but as a yankee fan      who wants to see the best yankee team id take      snow over mattingly at first  the yanks also gave up two     promising propects with snow for abbott  besides with     domingo jean brien taylor wickman militello and sterling     hitchcock they are just loaded with propects  i know abbotts     only 00 but this was too much to give up  i believe george     forced this trade because he believes and hes right that     abbott will be a big hit in ny  however id like to see the     yankees build a baseball team not an amusement show  0  wade boggs     i live in boston and like wade a lot  but his career is      winding down and i would rather see the yanks start to develop     a long term solution ie hensley muelins russ davis velarde     besides wade just doesnt have any range  what a shame about     charlie hayes huh  0  spike owen     see wade boggs  id much rather see them develop dave silvestri     or whoever  wade and spike next to each other in the infield is     going to raise the yankee staff era 00 point  and these guys     are on the down sides of their careers  0  danny tartabull     yes  hes put up some tremendous numbers and its nice to think     about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year  but he     never is  we should expect 000 games max out of him  meanwhile     gerald williams is playing at columbus and paul oneil is playing     left field  i believe oneil led nl outfielders in assists     last year  and tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder  what im basically getting at is the yanks are moving in the right direction but are not ready to win a pennent this year  they should at the gm level be planning for a 0000 or 0000 world series  this means getting the younger players experience in the majors now so they  will be ready in a year or two    im afraid that all this stuff wreaks of george steinbrenner certainly the boggs deal was all george  it looks like george is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now  the veterans are always available and can be added at any time like boston did this year  develop the young players first then add the one or two veterans or in the yankees case just keep them  lets all us yankee fans hope that george doesnt dismantle the terrific job stick and company have done building the yankee organization back into one of respect  im really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today relief pitching for example  george must realize that the yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away  have patience george and we will all enjoy the future  fire bucky and trade the kids and its baseball hell for all loyal yankee fans for a long time  sam im not militello or millitello mandelbaum

   havent been to many as games have you  theres also a difference in how tolerant i am of long games if im watching them on the tube and if im going there in person  for me going to an as game has become a major commitment of time one that im not willing to make that often  the length of their games is costing the as revenue from me  i stopped going to as games some years ago while i still lived inthe bay area for exactly this reason  i believe the length of their games has been institutionalized by larussaduncan  they encourage their pitchers to be overly deliberate to throw to first often to study the catchers signals and so on  and almost every as hitter takes a step out of the box after every pitch  this is not imo a coincidence this is planned  and i hate it  as for the gant situation i did not see the game or the replays  but i do wonder  what if gant had requested a time out  would hirschbeck have been required to give it to him  could he have denied the requst for all he the ump knew gant could have had dirt in his eye       mark singer     mssnetcomcom

   thats very true  i live in richmond home of the aaa richmond braves and they have this guy ryan klesko who hit 00 hrs at home last year  now that doesnt sound like a whole lot but the way the diamond is built home runs are a rarity   in fact ron gant brian hunter and david justice all proved they could hit in richmond  when they were sent to the majors they never came back if you can hit in richmond you can hit anywhere    so far after beating scranton phillies 00 in the first game the best team in aaa history has been rather underwhelming  too many expectations i guess

  me too rbi are a worthless stat of course so is stolen bases because  sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run and of course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases so batting average slugging and obp out too  hmmm i guess homers would not count then either my point rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is and no stat or lack of can tell me there are no clutch hitters maybe no stat can tell me either but some people are i just know it 0  but why would you want to use rbi   rbi is an attempt to measure is some combination of clutch hitting and power hitting  if you believe in clutch hitting then look at how the guy hit with risp  if you want to see how good of a slugger he is then look at his slugging average    in terms of evaluating players rbi totals are better than nothing  but why use them when so many better stats are out there   david frohardtlane   dflmathwayneedu   go tigers lions pistons red wings and wolverines

  npr this morning had an interview with linda mccarthy name possibly garbled by me an official historian for the cia  she has won an emmy for research on moe berg for a tv documentary which i know from nothing but which sounds good  she said that among other things berg was the  principal spy for the oss cias wwii precursor spying on axis atomic programs because of his physics background and language skills  she said that during the war he met with heisenberg in switzerland and had  instructions to shoot heisenberg if the germans were close to us in bomb research he concluded they were two years behind and didnt shoot him i have heard elsewhere that heisenberg deliberately misled the nazi bomb program but i dont know how reliable this is  unfortunately npr didnt mention any kind of a book shes writing  id certainly buy it  in case youre wondering about baseball relevance berg was a longtime mlb backup catcher  he was a member of an mlb allstar team that toured japan in 0000 presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few americans much less mlb players who spoke japanese photos he took of tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids according to mccarthy  dave mb   
  snicholsadobecom sherri nichols writes  stuff about ron gant incident deleted   a reasonable umpire would do as hes been instructed to do this season get  the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous  length of games  i for one am glad to see this happen   i agree that hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do and also that gant should have listened to him  however what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games  you are the first person   nonmediot  i have seen endorse this policy  i have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the espn crowd  and other announcers  bitching about it  i have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and shouting hurry up  if i cough up big bucks for a  ticket i dont mind a game that last more than 000  i really dont understand it    games are longer now for several reasons  more pitching changes more basestealing  and throws to first  etci think a very small factor is the increased time it takes jose canseco deion sanders insert fancy showboat ballplayer here to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the batters box  my impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this an issue because they like shorter games  they get to head back to hotel bar eat steaks get drunk tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase stewardesses around the bar  sure they want the game over with  print  journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games they have deadlines  the espn guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy  they constantly harp on this  primarily because they often have to work late  when the game goes longer than 000  maybe i am just a neerdowell with nothing better to do but i  would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you  as a parenthetical note it seems the league is in any case fighting a losing battle this year  the increased offense thus far will certainly  spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly  nick flynn

  kubeysgicom ken kubey writes and finally id like to point out that many high obp guys draw  their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them than because they have a great eye  this comes up periodically and i just dont get it take for example mark mcgwire he walked 00 times in 0000 if thats not a potential great example of what youre talking about then i dont know what is now lets look at what happens when mcgwire doesnt walk   00 of the time he made an out   00 of the time he hit a single   0 of the time he hit a double   00 of the time he hit a homer now youre pitching against mcgwire would you trade 00 walks for 0 homers 0 double 0 singles and 00 outs i would why give him the base when you can get him out 0 times out of 0 then there are guys like alex cole who has a career 000 obp even though hes never had a batting average over 000 he did hit 000 in 000 ab in 0000 or hit a single home run yep thats right hes never hit a homer in 000 abs through the end of 0000 whod be afraid to throw a strike to him   mike jones  aix highend development  mjonesdonaldaixkingstonibmcom  ive never been prejudiced by sex entertained yes but never prejudiced  justice dan snow walter matthau  
  tim shippert recently posted summaries of last years defensive average stats in terms of the linear weights estimated runvalue of defensive performances compared to league average  ive combined those with my positionadjusted mlv numbers to come up with firstapproximation total run values for players last year  we can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the mvp award  major caveats  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment so if san diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield that will cause some inaccuracies  the offensive numbers are positionadjusted but not park adjusted so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair  finally we still dont know what to do about catchers and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions  of tony phillips and bip roberts    having said that there are still some surprises  lets look national league first  all numbers in total runs contributed over the season  playeroffensedefensetotal  sandberg  00  00 00 bonds  00   0 00 walker  00  00 00 justice  00  00 00 daulton   00   00 larkin  00   0 00 grace  00  00 00  as i see it these are the legitimate mvp candidates from last season if you deflate sandbergs offense a wee bit for playing in wrigley you get essentially a dead heat  had bonds been his usual defensive self it wouldnt have been close but that apparently wasnt the case  darren daulton needs 00 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference and i couldnt tell you whether thats easy or impossible  a good case  could be made for any of sandberg bonds or daulton as top dude  my personal vote  bonds sandberg daulton walker justice   in the american league  playeroffensedefensetotal  ventura  00  00 00 martinez  00  0 00 b anderson   00  00 00 thomas  00  0 00 r henderson  00  00 00 raines  00  00 00 tettleton  00   00  ok lets see a show of hands how many of you picked robin ventura as top player in the al last year  i certainly didnt but id have a hard time arguing against him at this point  yes i know these numbers are only approximate but thats a big gap between him and the 0 guy  also those of you who thought rickey henderson stank last year are out of your minds  once again theres a catcher in the ointment  if calling a game is as important as it might be 00 runs is easy to make up or give away  take a guess folks i dont think we can do any better than that  my personal vote excluding pitchers  ventura tettleton anderson martinez henderson  im a big frank thomas fan but i have to admit to a bias in favor of balanced offensivedefensive contribution which should have a higher leverage in wl record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with negative defense  for the record  carlos baerga  00  0  00 roberto alomar  00 0  00  forget it its a wash  let me also take this opportunity to admit that i was grossly wrong regarding don mattinglys defense this past season  don recovered brilliantly from his weak 00 and 00 to end up with  mattingly  0  00  00 runs  which is clearly an aboveaverage first baseman  however its still 00 runs behind mark mcgwire 00 runs behind frank thomas and 0 runs behind john olerud  on the other hand its ahead of rafael palmeiro cecil fielder and every other al first baseman not yet mentioned       david m tate   dtatepittedu   greetings sir with bat not quick       member iie orsa tims sabr      hands not soft eye not discerning                                        and in denver they call you a slugger    the big catullus galarraga        and compare you to my own mattingly

    before folks jump on me let me ask the net  would the jays  have won the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morris given  his run support  how about an average ml pitcher  i cant believe  that morris performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive  impact on the jays performance   i know its very trendy nowadays to dump on morris but lets give credit where credit is due  it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris last year when the team went 0000 for the month of august and all the  other starters were being shelled and milwaukee was making a charge morris went 00 with a pretty good era i cant remember exactly also lets not underestimate the importance his 000 innings to save  the bullpen every fifth day  if he didnt help us win the al east forget about the pennent and the world series  his run support was high 000 runs but so was stottlemyers 000 runs and he won only 00 games  i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of 00 and 00 ballgames but this is to his credit  he pitched only as good as he needed to be  when he was up 00 in a ballgame he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out i hate this expression  an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out  trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down  but morris being a  veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball  by saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra i hate this too when the game was on the line  yes morris is crapping out big time this year but lets not change history to suit the present    btw i think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a  veteran pitcher which cito would never do but his era is 00 how much more can he be embarrassed     from where i sit ill let others have the excellent players  ill  settle for good enough and the ring   ditto     joe leonard  jleworldstdcom    eddie   
   give jackson a breakhe lost about 00 pounds with that flu he had when he was traded   dj was a popular player in san diego derek bell was not faring well in the clubhouse at toronto so no matter how bad he looks now i still think it was a steal for the jays just from the perspective of team chemistry no statistic can describe it sorry statheads and since there are so many new faces in the clubhouse i think the jays are still trying to find it  insert the same comment into the jack morris v clemens ws ring string  yet at first i was sad to see derek go still anticipating all of the talent they raved about at the beginning of last season  im glad to see him faring well for the padres though                                       eric

   you want to speed up ballgames     0  mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches the current      rule is too lenient and then enforce it  fifteen seconds is more      than enough time  if the pitch isnt released in 00 call it a ball      and restart the clock   i remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work  i dont remember why they said that it did not work  anyone remember this  jody mcdonnel on wip in phil has been saying that a pitch clock was inevitable  how would a pitch clock work on throws to first  another pair of suggestions 0 remove the balk rule  it is the runners responsibility to stay safe    no matter what the pitcher does  0 if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time x  0 to 0    without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base    as if walked  the nobalk seems to give the pitcher the advantage  the basewalk allows the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base   baseball games take about 000 in the nl and just a shade under 0 hours  in the al  thats just too damn long  i dont like to play in 0 hour  games much less watch a game for that long  my butt falls asleep and  if im watching on tv ill channel surf between pitches catching  colorized versions of mr ed leave it to beaver and those wacky  nieporents on nick at nite  i too find myself surfing when i know that it will be enough time between each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his jewlery             gary huckabay    you think thats loud enough ahole                movie rights    well if youre having trouble hearing it sir        available thru    id be happy to turn it up for you  i didnt            ted frank     know that many people your age liked kings x     david madden

  the reason i bothered doing this dr stuff was to see if i could determine the answer to the ageold question is jeff blauser more valuable than rafael belliard  well it looks like just as doug trumped tim beating him to the net with his defensive analyses so tim has gotten in ahead of me  the way i was doing it was a little different being me of course i used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth and i calculated both rate of performance fielding equivalent average and total performance fielding equivalent runs but i compared not to the average player but the replacement player and heres why because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system in the al of 0000 the average ss is 000 runs above replacement rar cf 000 0b 000 0b 000 lf 000 rf 000 0b 000 we may quibble with the exact numbers but the order looks substantially right  in the equivalent average i have always set league average to 000 i had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of 000 the name of that replacement level hitter often as not is billy ripken i decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from 000 as 000 but in the opposite direction as i have set it up that makes for an eqa of 000 yes i can add runs are proportional to eqa squared the difference between 000 squared and 000 squared equals the difference to 000 squared and i rounded off for simplicity an allreplacement fielding team would have randy milligan at first 000 willie randolph 000 at second leo gomez 000 at third walt weiss 000 at short kevin bass 000 in left hojo 000 in center and eric anthony 000 in right ugh  so the total number of rar for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding rar i can rate them by total rar or rar per some number of batting outs like 000 an average player has a total rar of about 00 00 batting 00 fielding  total rar batfield  0 bonds      000 00000  ventura    000 0000 0 sandberg   000 0000   thomas     000 00000 0 van slyke  000 0000   anderson   000 0000 0 grace      000 0000   raines     000 0000 0 lankford   000 0000   puckett     00 0000 0 pendleton  000 0000   alomar      00 0000 0 finley     000 0000   martinez e  00 0000 0 bagwell    000 0000   mack        00 0000 0 butler      00 0000   mcgwire     00 0000 00 sheffield   00 0000   griffey     00 0000 00 larkin      00 0000   devereaux   00 0000 00 grissom     00 0000   henderson   00 0000 00 walker      00 0000   listach     00 0000 00 justice     00 0000   lofton      00 0000 00 w clark    00 0000   baerga      00 0000 00 kruk        00 00 0   d white    00 0000 00 o smith    00 0000   palmeiro    00 0000 00 gwynn       00 0000   sierra      00 0000 00 hollins     00 0000   carter      00 0000 00 j bell     00 0000   gonzalez    00 0000  notable entries in a per000 batting out rating nl top 0 are bonds 000 lf sandberg 000 0b van slyke 000 cf grace 000 0b larkin 000 ss justice 00 rf sheffield 00 0b one at each position measured mcgriff despite 00 batting rar fifth in league finishes out of the top 00 due to a 00 in fielding last by position  galarraga 00 stillwell 00 hansen 00 belliard 00 blauser gad a 00 0rd in league may 00 dascenzo 00 anthony 00  in the al muchmaligned rickey henderson was worth 000 second only to frank thomas 000 ventura edges edgar at third 000000 grebeck rates a potent 000 griffey edges puckett as top cf 0000 listach nudges out lofton among rookies 0000 and alomar clearly outpoints baerga 0000 last by position segui 00 sojo 00 palmer 00 lewis 00 polonia 00 cuyler 00 v hayes 00  all for now  clay d

          if i were the manager id argue that the runner was out of         the base line since he was to the left of the first base         line  if the umps dont budge which they wont  they nev         er admit when they are wrong id file a protest with the         league  rule 000k states it is interference by a batter or runner when  in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base  he runs outside the threefoot line or inside to the left of the foul line and in the umpires judgment interferes with the field er taking the throw at first base  the key word in the rule is and a runner isnt out just for running out of the baseline hes out for interfering with the fielding of the ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first because the catcher opted to throw the ball over the batterrunners head theres no inter ference    so what is your definition of interfering with the fielder taking the throw  the rule book certainly doesnt have a definiton or clarification so its possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter his throw to avoid hitting the batterrunner then again we have interference you know it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justlyif the catcher or the pitcher say rob dibble for example throws toward first and hits the runner running inside the baseline the fielder takes the chance of being ejected  therefore he probably would throw around the runner or your scenario above him  you should note that in our american legion league which uses mlb rules we interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there is interference per rule 000  rstimets    
  umpires are not required to call time out just because a player asks for time only in extreme cases like dust in the pitchers or hitters eyes should an umpire call time  the batter has 00 seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch im against putting a giant clock or any size clock for that matter up to count down 00 seconds between pitches and the minute for warmups but i think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever and instruct the pitcher to pitch the same goes for pitchers umps should tell them to pitch or feint within 00 seconds or a ball will be called thats the way it should be   ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine  io00000mainemaineedu  
  it depends if in the judgment of the umpire the batter made no attempt to avoid getting hit the batter is awarded first for a base on balls if the umpire rules he did try to get out of the way hes awarded first because of a hit batsman  ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine  io00000mainemaineedu  
  pitchers are required to pitch or feint or attempt a pickoff within 00 seconds after receiving the ball not 00  pitchers are required to pitch their warmup throws within a one minute time frame beginning after each half inning ends not two minutes  and the reason why a reliever should be allowed warmups is simple different mound different catcher  ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine  io00000mainemaineedu

  thomas theiner theindamabusinformatikrwthaachende wrote  hi there    im german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now  there are many problems occuring for me one of them is the era statistic for  pitchers what does it say   era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game  thus if a pitcher pitched 0 innings and gave up 0 earned run his 0 inning equivelent perfomance would be 0 earned runs thus his era is 000  to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 0  era  erip  0  an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error  more specifically if an error occurs that represented the third out all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game  here are some examples  if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base  if an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after this error and not counted as earned runs  if a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who were left on base  if the those runners who were left on base score and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game  i hope this explains things for you  joe

  dale seer stephenson writes while i can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around gant wasnt ordered back in the box sooner he was ordered back immediately as soon as he stepped out hirschbeck told him to get back in the box now gant doesnt take a lot of walks between pitches  the only reason he did then because he was very bothered by the call  i expect his concentration wasnt there yet and in a crucial situation i imagine its best to be as calm as possible  contributing factors would be gants bad day at the plate bad year at the plate and the braves long scoring drought  and it is not hirschbecks job to help gant with any of these difficulties if gant cant gather his concentration for whatever reason that just makes him all the more meat in the batters box  the umpires job is to  maintain flow of play  gant is not entitled to time to regather his faculties  nor is anyone else  now its pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there  you know the umpire is going to do something call for a strike throw you out etc  gant was wrong  absolutely  i think itd be more accurate to say gant was foolish  but hirschbeck was more wrong in my biased view  aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder what was the problem  gant had a reason to want some time disputed strike call    if a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout games would last about ninefifteen weeks if jack morris or dave whiner stieb were pitching  a disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out suck it up get back in the box and never badmouth the blue  theyre not going to change their mind and youre just going to come across as a pinhead which wont help you with the borderline calls  ftr  i never speak to umpires when i dont know them personally nor do i glance at them or react to calls  as a result i think i get more than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate because i have a rep of having a good eye  actually there are a lot of negative connotations that go with that rep including copious questions about my masculinity party affiliation and sexual preference  gant hadnt been wasting time all game  the game had been cruising along and was just over two hours old  irrelevant  he was wasting time then  the score was 00 with 0 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position is there any reason hirschbeck couldnt and shouldnt cut gant a little slack    0  because its not his job  0  because setting the precedent of cutting slack there can easily      extend to those 0 hour games  kind of like the phantom dp  for no discernible constructive reason hirschbeck disrupted the game caused a five minute delay and materially hurt the batter in a key situation  did he have a date to get to  gant hurt himself and the braves disrupted the game  your biases are exposed and im sitting here defending umpires and the sf giants which is like phyllis schlafly defending gary segura jack kevorkian and the swedish abortion team    and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game  i believe terry said the magic word  there are some truly quick ways to get tossed from a ballgame  for a primer email me  good ways to get tossed from a game  0  ask ken kaiser if he got his money back from nutrisystem 0  kiss rich garcia on the lips and say hi honey im home 0  goose eric gregg 0  ask bruce froemming if his parents had any children that lived 0  get naked  source the greg spira book of diamond ettiquette as told to  peter gammons  0000 collier press        gary huckabay    outside  that was right down the bleedin pipe   balder than any    kenny  i realize i dont have great control but    dave on the net   cmon  gary that was a styrofoam cup  the           really       plates a foot to your right  throw the ball     
   of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that galarragas inability to defer gratification isnt hurting his team because he isnt paid to walk or is an rbi guy or whatever  alright thats enough ive suffered with all kinds of insults as typical for the net but give me a break galarraga is currently batting over 000 and you guys are complaining that he isnt drawing enough walks  what would he have to do to please you guys bat 0000 you can hardly claim that he is hurting his team  if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen then i would agree with you that he isnt taking enough pitches my comment that he isnt paid to walk doesnt mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs its more along the lines of hes batting 000 and leading the league in rbis so what bloody difference does it make if he isnt drawing  a lot of walks sheesh  greg

   i dont think it was that obvious at the time that viola was better morris and viola had comparable kip ratios in 0000  viola was coming off an injury whereas morris was healthy  at the time i didnt really want the sox to sign either  i was more than a little worried about violas elbow  but you surely remember my shout of relief when after a week of rumors that morris was coming to the red sox they ended up with viola instead  now im even happier  viola seems to have rebounded nicely  also morris was willing to sign for only two years the jays dont like to sign pitchers to longterm contracts which i think is a sensible policy  how long did viola sign for  three years  i generally agree with their policy of avoiding longterm contracts for pitchers  but i think they enforce it rather too strictly  these days the premier pitchers all sign three or four year deals  which leaves the jays with morris and stewart  if the jays want to compete for top free agent pitchers they will have to accept greater risks  any idea what the option year deal is for morris  are there any automatic activation clauses  what is the buyout amountf  cheers valentine

      another pair of suggestions    0 remove the balk rule  it is the runners responsibility to stay safe       no matter what the pitcher does     0 if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time x  0 to 0       without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base       as if walked  this last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases considerably  suppose the pitcher uses up n0 of his n pickoff attempts  the runner can probably stretch his lead off the base given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it right this time  would this suggestion apply to pickoff attempts per pitch per batter or per base runner on the same base     dr edward j baranoski            mit lincoln laboratory             its got to be the going rm j000d po box 00                 not the getting there thats good lexington ma 00000                        harry chapin from greyhound 0000000000   
   alright thats enough ive suffered with all kinds of insults as typical for the net but give me a break galarraga is currently batting over 000 and you guys are complaining that he isnt drawing enough walks  what would he have to do to please you guys bat 0000 you can hardly claim that he is hurting his team  fine are you willing to bet that he will bat 000 the rest of the way  the point is that he has hurt the rockies so far its that he will hurt them eventually  just as much as he hurt the expos and the cardinals the past couple seasons  if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen then i would agree with you that he isnt taking enough pitches my comment  it has happened for the past 0 seasons where have you been  that he isnt paid to walk doesnt mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs its more along the lines of hes batting 000 and leading the league in rbis so what bloody difference does it make if he isnt drawing  a lot of walks sheesh  well see come september  i have an outstanding bet with someone that galarragas obp will be less than 000 on june 0   go california angels  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu

   the red sox usually have 0 catchers  i dont think they have a backup now but they used to use randy kutcher as a backup catcher as well as a middle infielder and outfielder  you dont need a good 0rd catcher just a competent one so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field         john carr jfcathenamitedu

       i hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of wfan and wipi go to school in philadelphia and i listen to both stations on a consistant basis  now that the fan has mike lupica on from 00 to noon they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews and not just of local importance he did have dave cheketts and fred wilpon on his show but he  had bob costas and magic johnson on too     now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent morning show   in my opinion i think imus is much better than bruno cataldi  and morganti even though i would feel different if morganti had a better crew of people to work with  to me wip tries to copy imus but make it all sports as a theme  in terms of sports imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves but he interjects humor and politics into his show 00 am to 00 noon   i think chuck cooperstein and lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show but i think chuck has the advantage over lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round  lupica and the other hosts on fan get better interview guests but i heard the pd of wip say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story   i would consider this even because they are two different styles of host  00 noon to 0 pm   at this point i would have to give a big advantage to  jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks  i just think jm has the ability to transcend the homer mentality of the philadelphia fan base  this is most evident when the igglesphiladelphia  spelling play the cowboys because jm is a huge dallas fan where else can you have people call up and predict a 000 score without the egging of the hostsrewip morning guys i do agree that jm was great on the fan weekend overnight and i miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts  i feel that jm is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin  if you are in ny and you cant get wip jm does fill in on the weekends sometimes  0pm to 0pm   this is the time when jm goes up against francesa and  russofatso and froot loops and i become the most divided in my loyalties  mike and the dog are very entertaining but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 00 to 00 minutes without talking about sports  matd do get great guests and that is the basis for their show so it is like the 00 to 00 debate  another plus is the appearances by mike and chris on imus in the morning which are often hilarious    0 pm to 0 pm   matd go up against fredericks and missanelli  i like mike missanelli but i just cant stomach steve fredericks   i know that sf came from philly originally but when he was at the fan he was a ny homer as much as he is a philly homer now  i dont listen to wip much after 0 pm unless there is a game on that night but you will see later for the  reason  that is why i give the advantage to fan  0 pm to midnight   sm are on wip until 0 and then it is the man who makes eli that calls matd all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism g cobb  this man is so grating on my nerves that if i listen to him for a few minutes i go nutsi know that is biased but listen to his show on fan there is usually a game on knicks rangers mets jets or st johns basketball  if the game is on the west coast then it is usually howie rose  of course i think dead air would be better than g cobb on wip but wip does air sixers and flyers games during the season if this is the sports station why did they lose the iggles to wysphome of howard stern in phil during the summer it is all talk on wip   overall i would have to give the advantage to wfan with the exception of 00 to 00 and 0 to 0 where it is even and 00 to 0 where wip has the advantage                   rich     youve read the hat now see the movie                    imus in the morning    a blurb youre a blurb                    seinfeld

  off and on over the last several months threads about rbis and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can  predict a players rbis using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position risp that he bats with  in the brock0 model bill james calculated predicted rbis as rbi000total bases  home runs  this  completely ignores the context which was all that brock0  could do since context was unknown to it  so i thought id take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing rbihome runs to slgrisp  ive started with team data using data from the eliass that ive picked up over the years when a i could afford them and b i could stomach the thought of increasing eliass profits that gave me the years 00000000 0000 and 0000  i dont  have team rbis for 00 or i could add that year  if you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   rbihome runs  000slgrisp  the correlation between the lhs and the rhs is 000 which is significant at a ridiculously high level  so i feel like the fit is good at the team level  ive no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 0 players will clark ozzie smith joe carter and don mattingly  i hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year  it doesnt do too badly except the equation underpredicts the low hr hitter smith which may be a fault of the model or it could just be ozzie  the results                             rbihr          years        actual   predicted carter  000000     000       0000 clark   00000000  000       0000 mattly 000000     000       0000 smith   000000     000       0000  i think we can make a case and i hope to make it stronger that rbis can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up  more later harold   harold brooks                    hbrooksuiatmaatmosuiucedu national severe storms laboratory norman ok i used to work for a brewery too but i didnt drink on the job p bavasi on dal maxvills view that florida can win the nl east in 00

  just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the dodgers one of  my least favorite in la sweet  also the mets my other least  favorite team loss to the rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the cardinals are on the espn tonight  big lee smith is having a great start and the cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs  hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training the runners lob will be lower this year probably due to the high strikeout numbers by jose and lankford and zeiles off year  i dont know why all the fuss about the fillies  the media and all the  filly fans on rsb forget who is right behind them in the standings   give the wild thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games  and well see who is in first then  i believe the cardinal pitching  staff is more complete than the filly staff and that will make the difference  on a side note a few years ago 00 a comment was made by some  baseball player or manager about the dodger defense  he was asked  where to hit the ball against the dodgers and he replied fair  i  remember it being in the they said it section of sports illustrated i would like to know who said it and what issue it was in  go redbirds  gary wieman

    most of the points you made about lopez v berryhillolson have been made by others and realizing that lopez must be the second coming of frank thomas i have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters   nope theyre baseball management possible the most shortsighted  collection of people in the nation do you not believe this goes on mark do you think frank thomas needed those three months in aaa in 0000  see  this is essentially what everyone was doing    comparing lopez to one of the best players in the game  im really looking forward to seeing this cantmiss superstar now  as for thomas i remember being an advocate of his being brought up in 0000 even though he was only 00 or 00 cant remember  but who did the sox have at first calderon  martinez  kittle  the spot was there  the talent was there  sure i say go for it  i am not convinced that lopez is anywhere near as talented as thomas was after his aa season in 0000 and i am not convinced that olson berryhill are nearly as bad as kittlemartinez were  btw i dont think thomas was hurt by those three months      or cal eldred wasnt really better than ricky bones last year  well if we cant compare our guy to one of the best in the game lets compare our decision to one of the most boneshead right  cal eldred was 00 when he came up with a full season at aaa and a longer minor league career  frankly i dont know why he didnt make the club in 0000  bones is a year younger with a lousy prior history and just watching him makes me think that i missed a  career as a bigleague pitcher  no one   i repeat no one   laughed louder than i did at the sheffield trade  though i guess mieske has a future  i take it back mcilvaine may have laughed louder    youre mostly polite make defensible if flawed cases have wit and have in the past admitted being wrong that does qualify you on rsb well make an sdcn out of you yet    aw gee shucks  thanks guy  except i missed the part where sdcns admit theyre wrong    the beastmaster    mark singer     mssnetcomcom

   so who will start this years all star game for the al    probably alomar     not to put him down hes a great player but it helps to have   all the recognition hes had plus to play in a city which is  likely to pour in the votes  i like alomar  but id like to differ with your opinion about a city which is likely to pour in the votes  i attended many games last year during the balloting  i know that a great number of the attendees did not fill out their ballots but left them beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands  toronto gets no more and no less votes than any other city for the all star game  unfortunately this is not a one time thing  ive attended games during the last four seasons and it has happened every time  the apathetic attitude to all star ballots really offends me  ljs

  dak000svmasmsuedu said  nohal mcrae is the worst manager in baseball  ive never seen a guy who can waste talent like he can  one of the best rawtalent staffs in the league and hes still finding a way to lose  ill be surprised if he makes it through the next 0 weeks unless drastic improvement is made  im confused  how is it hal mcraes fault that he cant win with a team  whose best offensive player is phil hiatt  i mean lets be real  kansas city will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end up near 000 they have less offense than any other team in baseball even if you count the expansion teams        david m tate   dtatepittedu   greetings sir with bat not quick       member iie orsa tims sabr      hands not soft eye not discerning                                        and in denver they call you a slugger    the big catullus galarraga        and compare you to my own mattingly  
   one of the chapters in palmer and thorns hidden game is titled pitching is 00 of baseball implying that fielding is 0  how do they determine that  beats me  its been a long long time since i read it  this was my opinion the stupidest thing in the hidden game the argument was  0 defense or runs allowed is 00 of the game 0 unearned runs amount to 00 of the runs allowed earned runs 00  0 since unearned runs are the result of fielding not pitching and earned runs are the product of pitching not fielding fielding is 00 of defense and pitching is 00 of defense 0 caombining with 0 pitching is 00 of the game fielding 0  pete is usually sharper than that my own feel is that fielding is in the 0000 of defense range call it 0000 between fielding and pitching  one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around 000 and 00  id give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe 000 or even 0000 give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds identical batting stats which wouldnt be that unreasonable and even if you dont let roberto steal a single base theyll score a lot more than the oleruds by going firsttothird more often no offense gordon  clay d

  rvestermvmaccndedu writes  some discussion about whether elias is money grubbing deleted  funny it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks which are nothing but collections of statistics are authored by bill james and stats inc and howe for the minor league handbook  and i am not sure how the 0000 bill james player ratings book qualifies as a book with statistics while the elias analyst is a statistics book the analyst contains more stats sure but it also contains more dialogue  finally the point was not about the word statistics  it was about moneygrubbing  i dont see how anyone who has looked at the bill james player ratings book cannot consider him moneygrubbing  bob vesterman  some thoughts and facts  0  bill james is a partial owner of stats inc  however he has almost nothing to do with the daytoday operations of the company although he does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name the handbook but not the scoreboard  to the best of my knowledge the only things that bill actually writes for stats are the predictions section of the handbook and the bill james fantasy baseball rulebook  0 the debate over elias goes way back  bill james early stuff was hampered by the fact that elias would not give access to their stats at any price project scoresheet and later stats were founded to fill this void  you can call stats and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database and they will provide it  for a price of course  or you could just log into their online system and look at the data yourself  having attempted to pry numbers from elias in the past football not baseball they just dont do that  in stats eyes the high ground comes from making the information available at all  0  that being said im pretty dissapointed by bills book this year too i am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers  desire to have the book come out sooner than april  hope this makes things just a little bit clearer  bias alert  i am a former parttime employee of stats  noel rappin noelchaoscsbrandeisedu

  yes i could look it up but i prefer to post this question  to the net i read somewhere in a long forgotten article that the handsignals  used by major league umps were originally used to help a  deaf ball player by the name of dummy urban myth true  i gots ta know  dummy hoy a late 00thcentury baseball player was deaf  in order for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or strike the umpires developed hand signals  this also helped to relieve the stress on umpires vocal cords so they didnt have to shout strike or ball 000 times a game heard about this one from the only worthwhile baseball book john thorn has ever authored a century of baseball lore     mark b mbrownelalchemychemutorontoca  jason a miller some doctor guy frank tanana  0 win

   i agree with nick  whats the big deal about long games  if you want to watch baseball theres that much more baseball to watch  and yes baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves  i dont really mind the length of games either  if they want to speed the games up in sensible ways thats fine with me too  however what i object to is the assertion by baseball people whitey herzog buck rodgers are who ive heard say this that games are too long because hitters are taking too many pitches and that the strike zone needs to be expanded   john franjione department of chemical engineering university of colorado boulder franjionspotcoloradoedu

  hey folks  saw the giants play ball at the stick saturday april 00  it was the game where pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a twoout tworun homer to right to win it  it wasnt the game where the fans  threw the giveaway fotoballs onto the field in response to the homer  too bad huh  well the stick is still cold  the saturday game ended at 000pm and it was cold then  i cant imagine night games in april at the stick  the wind kicked up a little too and i got this idea  at most games theres a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on the field a lot of the time  i propose a kids cleanup corps composed mainly of 0000 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run out on the field in the fifth inning when the guy in the toro smooths the infield and grab the trash  it might not be glamorous but at that age i probably would have given anything to be on the field with the ballplayers  everybody wins here  whaddaya think  sean

  in kime00apr00000000mongoosetorolabibmcom kimemongoosetorolabibmcom edward kim writes  in article c0ro0hlwwworldstdcom jleworldstdcom joe m leonard writes   before folks jump on me let me ask the net  would the jays  have won the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morris given  his run support  how about an average ml pitcher  i cant believe  that morris performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive  impact on the jays performance   i know its very trendy nowadays to dump on morris but lets give credit where credit is due  it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris  well when you say without morris you have to mention an assumed replacement  if the alternative to morris was letting cito gaston softtoss the ball underhand to the opposition every 0 days then of course the blue jays wouldnt have won without morris  if the alternative was replacement level then i think it wouldve been very close and yes morris mightve made the difference  if the alternative was frank viola the blue jays probably would have won more easily with viola  last year when the team went 0000 for the month of august and all the  other starters were being shelled and milwaukee was making a charge morris went 00 with a pretty good era i cant remember exactly  yes  you can make the argument that the his presence prevented  the team from collapsing in august  also lets not underestimate the importance his 000 innings to save  the bullpen every fifth day  if he didnt help us win the al east forget about the pennent and the world series  those innings were probably helpful  his run support was high 000 runs but so was stottlemyers 000 runs and he won only 00 games  i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of 00 and 00 ballgames but this is to his credit  he pitched only as good as he needed to be  when he was up 00 in a ballgame he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out i hate this expression  an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out  trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down  but morris being a  veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball  by saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra i hate this too when the game was on the line  well i think is complete bs  what happened most of the time is that morris fell behind and the team came back and rescued him  mostly this is because hes a lousy 0st inning pitcher and much better the rest of the way  that the team can climb out of 00 00 holes consistently and win them 00 is not to morris credit its to the teams credit  furthermore while morris did exceed the wl percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support he hasnt done this in previous years  in fact his wl record in 0000 is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed do you think he just came up with this ability in 0000  look at the 0 postseason games he pitched decently in  typical morris games  morris gets behind team rescues him  hes not responsible for that rescue  and in both those games the team just didnt rescue him enough  jack morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those 0 games the offense just didnt earn him a victory  btw i think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a  veteran pitcher which cito would never do but his era is 00 how much more can he be embarrassed  morris is one of those guys who will reture when he cant start anymore hes too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen  greg   
  did anyone happen to see peter gammons on espn last night  he addressed this exact issue and dismissed it rather quickly  according to gammons advanced scouts are reporting that morris fastball and slider still have the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability to keep the ball hidden during his release  guzman and stottlemyre have gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a little work with the pitching coach  gammons looks to see morris back in top form within the month  i on the other hand still have my doubts  morris era last year was rather high for a pitcher who won 00 games  his showing in the series was not surprising  although im not convinced that hes washed up i have my doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the twins in 00  brian klaff   
  mzimmersnetcomcom michael zimmers writes  first a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball  i definitely do  thats why i dont like going to see games played on artificial turf   the lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches  and while its true that the gaps between plays can be interesting this is only true when they dont become extralong  well your idea of interesting differs from mine  i think batting practice is interesting for example and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it  i think the delaying tactics of batters pitchers catchers and managers are interesting because theyre attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game  of course the umpires can and should intervene when these tactics get out of hand  as ryan robbins has pointed out there are rules that cover this  one of the more fascinating things about baseball i think is its openendedness with regard to time  you never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours or if its going to go on until four in the morning  likewise some games are actionpacked and some games are slow and lazy  thats fine by me  those folks who want constant action should watch the games on tv so they can channel surf and cater to their short attention spans  heather hhendersonvaxclarkuedu

  is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly rbis this is the situation that brought the question up  the red sox were up in the bottom of the 0th by a score of 00  the mariners had the bases loaded with 0 out  the batter hits a fly to center which the fielder catches  the runner at third tags and scores without a throw    now without a judgement call and i dont think there is one this is an rbi for the batter  it seems to me that a better name for this would be defensive indifference since it doesnt really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point  i know i can think of several if the mariners stole third and second which opening the base would allow and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third he wouldnt have a play at home third or second for the out and maybe he therefore cant make the throw to first to get the last out etc scenarios too  but does it really matter if this guy scores this way when youre down by 0  if the tying run is going to score so is the guy on third  the point is that the batter imo shouldnt get credit an rbi for utterly failing to do his job  which at this point is to get a hit or a walk not trade an out for one run  what do you guys think  regards burke charles s homan chomanwpiwpiedu go red sox  000 go rocket 00

   as the heading indicates it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not batting 0th for the giants behind will clark  barry is such an awesome and consistent hitter  definitely the best in the national league  imho to  have williams a streaky hitter and not really a clutch hitter batting 0th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the giants  0 simple reasons  0   batting williams ahead of bonds will create a leftclark        rightwilliams leftbonds situation in the middle of the       batting order  this makes it tougher for opposing manager       to change pitchers  0   having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get       more good pitches to hit  this is important since he struggles       so much with breaking balls  opposing pitchers dont want to       walk williams to get to bonds   edward hui

   the phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings  last nights game was hard fought  the game in chicago should have been a blow out  all in all these two games show a different phillies team in past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 0 run games  i dont know how many times i saw them losing by only 0 run if they were able to win most of those they might have been more of a contending team  they are 00 so far in extra innings  and of course they are 000

  i like the clarkwilliamsbonds order pitchers can only walk clark with 0 outs unlike last year  williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming in the ondeck circle  since matt has a terrible batting eye this helps the giants a lot  when bonds gets on base all by himself he can try to steal 0nd and then be driven in with a single by thompson manwaring or clayton  if you bat bonds before the other sluggers then you dont want him to run because a caught stealing could take you out of a big inning  also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer a walk is a potential double  the only draw back is when clark and williams are clogging up the  bases infront of bonds and i think thats a problem the  giants will be glad to see especially if robby thompson gets hot  ken kubey         kubeywpdsgicom  000 0000000

  maynardramseycslaurentianca roger maynard writes  we have no way of knowing because we cannot separate morris contribu tion  from the rest of the teams  there is only one way of determin ing best in baseball  and that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game  each game determines which team is the best that day  at the end of the season the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division  the playoffs determine the best of the best  but the point is that the only decision making pro cess  used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re lates to the teams  not the individual players  there is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances  and that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game  and you know what  there is no such method inherent in real life either  so i would assume you would endorse the notion that we  cannot state with any level of objectivity that mother theresa has accomplished more good in this world than joseph stalin after all life on earth is a team effort  if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria then fine  but you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individuals  contribution  to  winning  the ws  because  that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the  context  of  base ball   so  until you can prove that clemens contributes to a ws cham pionship more than morris your evaluation of  clemens is totally  sub jective  and  is  mere opinion  i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon  have you tried glasses  i find them quite useful    after all there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds of evidence we present  its too bad you feel it necessary to close your mind and eyes to knowledge you live a poorer life as a result of that choice  heck id wager that you could predict a ws winner with greater accuracy than jeanne dixon  and you know why  because i have full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level     you dont have to be rude  have you tried calling a kettle black  for you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy  ignoratio elenchi  i am not saying that morris is better than clemens   because he   has  more   rings   although  i  have  tongue in cheek claimed that in the past  i am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individuals  performance   from that of his teams for the purpose of comparing that individuals performance with another individuals per formance  in other words in your world you cannot objectively state that jack morris was more important to the blue jays than al leiter last year  in your world that may indeed be true  fortunately in the world the rest of us occupy its not  i hope you never serve on a jury roger  i think the rest of the jury would have to kill you  theres no way i can objectively judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty  you see there are 0 billion other people on this planet  we have no way of knowing whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it wasnt for all the other people on the planet  we have no way of knowing how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet because living on this planet is a team effort  and no individual committs a crime totally isolated from his society he is a part of that society  that being case anything i have to say on his culpability would be absolute subjectivity so i refuse to vote  greg

   as to whether it does him any good to have bonds behind him the  netstatmavens will probably tell you theres no reason that it should but if he thinks it will it might be a selffulfilling prophecy  i dont understand  if it is williams lack of ability which you say above and i agree with which causes him to swing at bad pitches how will thinking that bonds hitting behind him will help him to stop chasing bad pitches  i didnt mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that specific deficiency  i meant that if having bonds bat behind him gives williams possibly unfounded confidence that might translate into more hitting productivity  but youre right  if williams biggest problem is more physical than mental thats less likely to make a difference     michael zimmers                                      voice  000 000 0000   softhelp  suppliers to software developers         data   000 000 0000

  i didnt say that pitchers fear of throwing strikes to guys like mcgwire bonds and frank thomas was rational   i just said that it exists  but why mcgwire and not carter  i can see some justification for bonds or thomas because they tend to have higher batting averages but the major difference i see between mcgwire and carter is that carter doesnt draw walks  why arent pitchers afraid to throw strikes to carter  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom

  in mssc0qh0yl0pnetcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer writes  if this is true note that i dont think it is lasorda should be fired for at least two reasons           0 publicly humiliating his players          0 knuckling under to his players wishes  there is a fine line between getting players input and knuckling under to players demands  a manager much like a military officer needs to have his her players complete obedience and respect during a game  after the game its no big deal but when there is no time  to do more than react players must trust the manager or the team often falls apart see boston red sox ff      strawberrys demeanor as represented by the media often sounds like demands  i suspect that a comment like i enjoy hitting fourth im used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if it came from strawberry  russ porter quoted strawberry as saying i feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and i think i perform best in that role  paraphrased by my memory and bias  that seems like a fairly nonpetulant answer to what was almost certainly a question  like how do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order a more mediasensitive player might answer the manager knows what he is doing  if he thinks that batting me third will help the team then i am all for it  wed ignore that answer as brown stuff so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand darryls response as petulant  personally i think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesnt matter much in which order the 00 players in the order are batted except for personal stats  if i were darryl id probably answer that question the number four spot gets a few more rbi opportunities and i get paid for rbis  i think it is best for me to bat fourth but i am willing to hit third if tommy thinks it will benefit the team  or something like that  it would be helpful at salary timemy rbis were down because i was hitting thirdand make him sound like a team player  since strawberry will not likely go through arbitration but use the free agent market for his next contract maybe that argument is useless but it would help    his image with the media without appearing to be totally contentfree  remember the media is of the belief that ones best rbi man should hit fourth so the argument is sensible regardless of whether or not it is true jeff

  id have to say the most impressive hrs ive ever see came from dave kingman and his infamous moonraker drives  i remember one he hit circa 0000 at wrigley field that went across the street in dead center field and hit a house on the roof  he whiffed a lot but when he did connect watch out        include stddisclaimerh  dan s  
    polish and jewish are not mutually exclusive   i didnt mean to offend or anything im just quoting stanky himself on the subject i remember one time last year he was being interviewed by espn and the interviewer cant remember who asked stanky if he was jewish because he the interviewer was jewish and wanted to see more jewish ballplayers to which stanky replied im polish not jewish  so maybe that wasnt the most pc thing for stanky to say and maybe i was a little naive when i posted it i think we should just devote this subject to finding actual jewish ballplayers i myself am jewish and the only ones i ever knew until now were koufax greenberg and blomberg  alan  
  jrogoffscottskidmoreedu jay rogoff writes  one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasnt yet been addressed  i believe the rule also does not deal with this situation  however if the infield fly is not caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base wo fear of being doubled off for advancing too early    the runner can leave his base at any time  if the ball is caught hes got to tag up  if it isnt caught he doesnt have to tag up at all  so if hes feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up  if it isnt caught hes probably scored a run  if it is hes probably headed for aaa    the only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out thereby removing the force on the runners on base  all other rules apply as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up    tim shippert                                 shippertccocaltechedu if we are going to stick to this damned quantumjumping then i regret that i ever had anything to do with quantum theory e schrodinger

       the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to  death but i havent seen anything in rsb yet    gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two  on and his club down by a run  he stroked a line drive into the  right field corner  the ball cleared the threefoot high fence and  went into the crowd  darryl racing over from right center got to  the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he  missed the ball  a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt  reached up and caught the ball  home run    now ive seen the replay several times and i have concluded that  darryl missed the ball and that the fans glove was essentially  behind darryls  several dodger fans with seats in the immediate  vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with  strawberry  what cannot be disputed however is that the fan  who caught the ball never took his eye off it  he was oblivious  to where the fielder was playing  he was also quite exuberant as  soon as he realized he had made the catch    stuff about daryl and tommy and everyone blaming fan for the loss deleted  i saw the replay several times too  no question about it  daryl missed the ball then the fan caught it  daryl is so tall that he had the first shot at the ball  daryls just whining again  i think it shows a lack of class when tommy daryl and the dodgers blame a single fan for losing the game  what about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball what about the pitchers that gave up 0 runs up to that point  sorry tommy if it were a 00 game and daryl was 0 feet 0 inches tall then maybe  just maybe  youd have an argument  
  ive been following the giants closely over the offseason  newspapers notesgroup etc  but i had my first up close and personal last night at the stick  after watching giants hitters struggle last year barrys swing was  very impressive  hes very quick and his swing seems effortless even compared to clark particularly clark as of late  it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well  im not sure if barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits 0b 0b hr for 0 rbis  the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to bonds  there has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better  claytons defense has been superb mcgee seems to like leading off this year  manwaring is driving the ball so on  so forth  i hope it continuesi think they need to continue well into june before people are really sold that they are for realparticularly the pitching  for myself i think the fresh start of magowanbakeretc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year  joe loos looscuphpcom  
   buck showalter just cant win   bob wickmans pitching the game of his life through eight innings yanks lead 00 so buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete game wickman manages to get two outs but in between four funs score and all of a sudden its 00 and wickman just cant get the third out so buck goes to the bullpen and farr gets out the first guy he faces  last night jimmy key is pitching another in a long string of games of his life this guy just keeps getting better through eight innings yanks lead 00 this time buck thinks i dont want a repeat of that nearfiasco with wickman so ill give my bullpen some work steve howe whose era was 0000 coming into the game left with it at 0000 he didnt do too good then farr comes in he gives up a tworun homer and the royals win it 00  whats going on this is already the third or fourth time this year that the bullpen has blown a lead farr  howe have done it twice together monteleones done it once and i think even habyan did it once whats the deal we finally have terrific starting pitching so all of a sudden our bullpen turns to shit  whats buck gonna do and whats george gonna do if this continues to happen  alan

  jrogoffscottskidmoreedu jay rogoff writes  one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasnt yet been addressed  i believe the rule also does not deal with this situation  if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught runners can tag up and advance at their own risk as on any fly ball  however if the infield fly is not caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base wo fear of being doubled off for advancing too early  when the ball hits the ground  when a fielder first touches the ball after it hits the ground  enlightenment would be appreciated  im not sure i understand this question when the if rule is invoked the batter is automatically out this relieves the runners from being forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught other than that isnt it just the same as any situation in which a runner on a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball that is if the ball is caught he can tag up and run or decide to stay and if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time   eric smith ericsnetcomcom ericsinfoservcom ci 000000000

   ive been a giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained about the old ballyard place sure its been cold the food lines were long and the hired hands were surly but this was all part of the giants mystique or so i thought  i went to tuesdays game 0  0 giants over the marlins and the stick was  a much different place nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind but  everything is a lot better the lines are a lot shorter the bathrooms are clean and have running water and the hired hands were very polite   the new foghorn lights up and blows after each homerun and the wooden fence are very nice as are the new bleachers the bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view and theyve got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers the only complaint is that the electronic  oldfashioned scoreboard looks electronic  could be better  these things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real  businessman ex  safeway president peter magowan to figure it out just  like he used to tell his checkers if the customers dont come back i dont need as many checkers this isnt a knock on bob lurie  he was a competent businessman but he didnt deal much with the general public  ill give an example of how the level of service has changed the onion  dispenser jammed as i was using it an attendant came over apoligized for the problem and proceeded to fix the machine after he was done he cleaned the machine and said he was glad to be able to help in the old days there was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say go to the stand 000 feet away  they might be able to help  all in all it was a fun day    craig eid  email address    craigehpsadsadhpcom

    i agree though id also be happy with a stadium that looks  like new comiskey the new park was also made for baseball  unlike three rivers the vet riverfront etc its not a  football park in which they also play baseball  while were on the multipurpose subject lets not forget shea which was designed to accommodate both the mets  jets  it was the first stadium i think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football  not the first  rfk olim dc stadium was built 0 years earlier nowadays they dont move the seats back for the few exhibition games but the 0rdbaself lower deck used to move  it was all  metal which was pretty noisy on bat day  of course with the jets gone to jersey and a truly good football stadium the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where because its circular the seats are almost always too far from the action  the mets announcerskiner  murphy in particularhave always hyped it as beautiful shea stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is  its vastly better than it was before they fixed it though  back in the late 00s it was a dump  roger dont youlike jet noise    
       hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves it i  mean heck if dave winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it as  is lee smith ha then why dont we give dave kingman a chance or darrell  evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie  murray and jeff reardon  um what  eddie murray was a superb first baseman for a long time  winfield as produced consistently for almsot 00 years and excellently on several occasions    dave kingmans best year was like darryl strawberrys typical year with the mets    darrell evans too did a whole lot more than just hit homers which  is all that kong did         well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving  hall of fame consideration to players that are by todays standards marginal  whom are you talking about  yes eddie murray is marginal but thats because hes 00 years old  he wasnt marginal for a long time  honestly ozzie smith and robin yount dont belong there theyre both  shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal  not    smith has hung around for a long time and fielded the position better  than anyone else ever has  yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago in case you hadnt  noticed  one of his two mvp awards was as a centerfielder       lets be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so  liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if  like whom  there are many players in the hall who arent anywhere near as goos as the guys youre running down  something isnt done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when  thats already the case by some standards  but the bad players in the  hall are all from the 00s and 00s  recent picks have generally been excellent  certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan  no but who cares  was stan musial anywhere near as good as babe ruth not really  but he obviously belongs there  the hall has generally had about the top 0 of major leaguers  as  more players come through the game more will be in that top 0    and yes its pretty easy to argue that smith yount evans winfield etc are in the top 0  dave kingman on the other hand was a liability throughout most of his career  of course garvey hasnt gotten a lot of hof press so i dont know what you mean    as for ryan is his wl better than morris  thats what a lot of voters tend to look at  and morris was awfully good for a decade and doesnt lead mlb history in walks allowed either  roger

  sorry i gotta disagree here  last time i played ball i went up on several occasions intending to hit a fly ball deep enough to score the runner from third or advance a runner to third  its relatively easy actually you swing under the path of the ball you normally would to hit a good line drive  with fastballs its very easy much more difficult with good breaking balls  a good hitter with excellent bat control can voluntarily hit fly balls to the outfield at least oh 00 of the time  maybe more  theres a blurb in the stats scoreboard about this and though i dont have the book with me here my memory is that the best at hitting sac flies were far below this 00 number  sherri nichols snicholsadobecom  
   in article 00000astsaiccom sacasdisaiccom steve a conroy x0000 writes   major league baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter  attention spans ie the football crowd   invariably all the  arguments from people who dont like to watch baseball on tv say the  same thing  the games are too long and too boring  baseball is trying  to find a way to shorten the games for wider tv appeal  if you look at  it though baseball games last around the same amount of time as football  games  the difference is that there is more action in that duration in  football games  perhaps if there were more action in baseball games you  would get more of those fans to tune in  anyway coming up with a solution  to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult  on soapbox yet another reason to get a commisioner now since its obvious  that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in  nebraska off soapbox    how can you say there is more action in football then baseball a football  game consists of approximately 000 plays and the average duration of a play  is around 0 seconds this means that in a game that lasts approximately 0  hours you have about 00 minute s of action in a baseball game you have  upwards of two hundred pitches there are very few on field strategy   on field stratgy sessions ie huddles and you always have a chance to win  until the last out is made       ah but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and a sense of urgency because of the game clock not all the time but it happens when theres less than 0 minutes to go quite often  this sense creates drama even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewers attention  in baseball only 0 players are involved in the action for about here comes a wild guess 00 of the time  and theyre just playing a sophisticated game of catchholdtheballstepoutoftheboxadjustchains touchselfininterestinglocations  theres a lot of dead time with the players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher who then takes 0 00 pitches or helen dell playing the organ dodger fans will appreciate that one  to the non baseball junkie this is boring at any rate im not putting baseball down for this  ive been an avid fan since i can remember  its just that watching a baseball game on tv at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie  thats what major league baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of shortening the game  its because of tv not because football has more action than baseball    steve conroy conroyterminussaiccom  im gone man  solid gone   science applicationsbaloo international corporation

   some folks like to argue about theoretical details i prefer to watch teams win when the giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange the batting order until then i think its stupid to focus on whats wrong for the simple fact that its working as it is  this is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division but the giants are going to need every break they can get if they want too hold that lead  i dont think they can afford to be lackadaisical and say well it has worked pretty well so far and while we might be able to improve the results we dont think it is worth the risk  mostly though the giants are winning and frankly as long as that continues its rather silly to secondguess their strategy but evidently some folks would rather be right than be first  the two tend to go hand in hand  cheers valentine

    in article c0vhlhidzusenetucsindianaedu rstimetssilverucsindianaedu robert and stimets writes   in a game that saw a little of everythingincredible defense some power clutch pitching and a little wildnessthe reds managed to overcome their trademark lack of timely hitting in crucial situations   during spring training i made a similarly innoncentlooking comment   about clutch hitting on this bb and the flames were flying  no such  thing as clutch hitting they the sdcns all screamed  i assumed  they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance  given their comments    this is certainly not the case  there is no significant ability toi perform in the clutch but clutch performance certainly happens every time there is a gamewinning hit  the clutch pitching quoted above is something which happened not a claim that any particular player should be expected to be a clutch pitcher   over the past four seasons sabo has had 00 hits in 000 abs defined as  clutch situations by the scouting report for an average of 000  over that same period he had another 0000 abs with 000 hits for an  average of 000   according to the rest of the sdcns any differential such as this is  completely and totally random and cannot be used for any reasonable  inference such as perhaps perez should have used a pinch hitter in  that situation  simple statistics tell me that there is a 0 chance an average clutch hitter would have this large a split the average decrease is 0 points standard deviation about 00  there will be such hitters in any league just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on tuesdays  and there is only a very weak correlation 00 in my best study between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability  based only on this data i dont see any reason to pinchhit for sabo or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past  but there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinchhit does the pinchhitter give you a platoon advantage  any portion of sabos clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a real ability even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting  do you have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run  do you have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves   david grabiner grabinerzariskiharvardedu we are sorry but the number you have dialed is imaginary please rotate your phone 00 degrees and try again disclaimer i speak for no one and no one speaks for me  
    ideally dhs should be the strongest offensive players because  any schmoe can play dh if he can hit  that would take care of position  corrected anomolies such as franks  since that is not the case and why  not  is it always this way then we are going to have trouble finding the  true value of dhs using the same models as that for position players  there are several reasons for this difference  the main reason is that good hitters in their prime such as frank thomas and danny tartabull are rarely regular dhs even if they cant field its more commonly a place to put aging veterans  another use of the dh slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field  i would expect such players to hit worse as dhs than they did during the rest of the season  a third factor is that most player who split time between dh and first or the outfield dont hit as well as dhs for some reason  reggie jackson was a good example in five years as a rfdh for the angels he hit like the old reggie when he was in right  the second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only a player who plays 00 games in right and 00 at dh will count only in the right fielders averages   a logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement  value if you can find it for 0b or lf or something  we can assume that  if forced to play defense they would play at true zero value even though i  doubt this is actually true for players like winfield and molitor  this  would let us discount the time they spend playing dh because that  forces the team to find another real fielder to play  this makes sense you might also look at it another way  although the average offensive performance of a dh may be lower than for a left fielder the replacementlevel offensive performance is certainly lower if you are a left fielder but cant hit well enough to keep a job anywhere then you certainly cant hit well enough to keep a job at dh    david grabiner grabinerzariskiharvardedu we are sorry but the number you have dialed is imaginary please rotate your phone 00 degrees and try again disclaimer i speak for no one and no one speaks for me  
  in article mssc0xb0i0cgnetcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer writes  sigh  here we go again                       actually several scdns stated that there were no definable skills that would make a hitter more likely to perform better in clutch situations vs nonclutch situations however one might choose to define clutch  right  can you define such a skill  must i  if i were to say that batting average is a predictor that  can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a hit on a particular plate appearance is that only valid if i can define the skill in hitting a baseball  thats all ive said  except i used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations  and elsewhere on this thread sherri nichols repeats her position that batting average in clutch situations is a meaningless statistic  for predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless  at least if it has meaning we dont know how to find it  i did not say i could predict the future  ive suggested that the statistic is not necessarily meaningless  heres the data for this situation  nonclutchclutch  abhbaabhba  sabo000000000000000000 samuel000000000000000000   if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel  im sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance  you just wouldnt have used this particular aspect of prior performance  is this not correct   ill try to avoid being insulting  but its difficult when you so cavalierly dismiss hundreds of hours of work with an i dont pretend to understand but  nobody is denying that there are people who have hit well in the clutch in the past  but i challenge you to find a method to predict who will hit well in the clutch in the future  which after all is what you are claiming you can do  since   one more time  i did not claim to be able to predict the future i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo  and i am not dismissing your work  im stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work   fine  we have plenty of data  obviously our preconceived biases must be coloring our work since you know clutch hitting is a welldefined and consistent skill all of our failures notwithstanding  so i challenge you to prove it  i guarantee you that if you can prove the existance of some form of clutch ability you will have plenty of happy sdcns dancing around you  i did not say that clutchhitting is well defined  i said that the data is significant  to me  i did not say that it is a consistent skill  i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances   but you arent going to win any support by merely stating a position and claiming they are stupid so i must be right   and big sigh   i have not not  not   not    not     not      not ever called you or anyone else on rsb stupid   it is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases   yeah  hindsight is always 0000  doesnt that make you bright  this is a stupid argument and you know it  ah  i knew we could get to the name calling  and theres that word you like so much   a suggestion  take data from 00000000 and attempt to come up with some method that predicts who hit well in the clutch in 0000  if that works we can then attempt to apply it to 0000 and beyond  wait a minute  i thought i first had to define clutch hitting do i or dont i  you have made strong statements  now back them up or be proven a total idiot  i made two statements in my post  0i am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting  0i would have hit for sabo   as for 0 many of us make a number of written statements through  this media about what we think will happen in baseball  im not shy about it  ill make the statement again  i believe that by seasons end that chris sabos batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch situations  i cant prove that it will happen so i guess well  just have to wait and see                                      heres another one for you  in 0000  0000 joe carters batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in nonclutch situations each year  i presume you think this is random    nonclutch0000 ab000 h000 clutch 000 ab 00 h000  so what could we expect in 0000 from mr carter  well his composite ba through 0000 was 000  through 0000 was 000  through 0000 was 000 so i think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of batting average he can produce  in 0000 he hit 000  not surprising huh  also in 0000   nonclutch 000 ab000 h000 clutch  00 ab 00 h000  no this doesnt prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of  major league ballplayers  it just makes me think that in 0000 joe carters batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in nonclutch situations                                     as for 0 above i have plenty of company  john dewan of statsinc is the editor of the scouting report wherein the statistics regarding clutch hitting are compiled reported and referenced in the text bill james makes numerous references to a players ability to hit well in the clutch  i am not saying that i can predict the future any more than they are   you and others are saying that your work renders their statements and mine meaningless  i dont  accept that which in your words proves that i am a total idiot   stupid  total idiot    my my  such hostility    the beastmaster    mark singer     mssnetcomcom  
  like clinton and reno i accept full responsibility for this senseless disaster  my wife and i picked this game to go to and thus caused the return of the preseasonprojected sox offense  like all nonos bosio was good lucky hard grounder by vaughn off t martinez glove but straight to boone who  threw to bosio at first 000 and backed by good defense many nontrivial groundouts  the game was amazingly fast as the sox tended to go down quickly and hesketh was also  working fast  the sox relief pitching was ok  the runs off quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single which greenwell let get past him trying for a catch  greenwells mental stability is a serious concern i guess it has always been but his quirks were amusing back when he was an mvp candidate  wednesday he got in a huff with johnson a after striking out on a bad inside pitch apparently johnson made an ok ive got to stay focused gesture which iron mike interpreted as taunting and struck out to heavy booing the  next two times  as valentine noted last night he came up in the first after riles and quintana had walked to open the game can you say take the first pitch  not mike who dribbled it into a 000  the pi quoted bosio that this was a batting practice fastball  next time up he also hit the first pitch a hard liner straight to kgjr in center  he also made the pathetic error and failed to catch boones hr which looked  comparable to the ball lance johnson caught on the highlight reel that night  is riles suppsoed to be good defensively  i couldnt tell from the field angle but his range looked bad and he coughed a dp that cost a run or two  why was he leadoff  i hope fletcher gets well soon  also on lineups pinella put bret boone fifth for reasons beyond me  it seemed to work as he was 00 with a hr and some good defense a wag behind us said he sure dont want to go back to calgary  there is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth because theyll likely lead off the second as boone did  well now we face the hot angels and another power pitcher in langston  a reminder that contest entries are open through next wednesday  i expect a surge of pessimism  by the way ties will be broken by earliest entry  one entry per person or pseudonym please and easy on the pseudonyms  dave mb

    can anyone out there tell me why they call lefthanded pitchers  i dont know about the story but it comes from the fact that in most stadiums the batter faces northeast and so when a pitcher is on the mound his left arm is to the south hence the term  southpaw  also the story on how the term originated  thanks    go cubs   prediction they will finish over 000 this year without winning the east

  i watched the final inning of bosios nohitter with several people at work after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he wouldnt have had time to throw riles out yet the throw beat riles by about two steps i wonder how many others who watched the final out think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand does anybody think vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded and if he failed to field it cleanly would it or should it have been an error or a hit judging from bosios grimace when the ball bounced past him he must have thought it would go through for a hit whether vizquel was right or wrong he certainly made one hell of a play      phil brown                 aka pb0000cscalbanyedu    
   but it is subject to all kinds of bias and is almost completely   useless  for first basemen  from the raw stats there is no way to tell   which of  a first basemans putouts were made on throws from other fielders   and  which were made on his own plays likewise you cant tell whether   a  double play was 000 or 000  fielding runs thus gives a first  baseman no credit for putouts or double plays only for assists and  errors    but ingnoring putouts is biased in yet another way range is not the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman the ability to field all sorts of balls thrown to him digging some out of the dirt stretching for others and so forth is important thus  putouts do provide some information  maybe what we need is a comparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the first baseman vs how many he actually got    jim mann             stratus computer   jmannvinelandpubsstratuscom

   oh yea and chris bosio pitched a nohitter  one over the minimum two bases on ball in the first inning one runner left 00 pitches  i listened to the game on radio and listening to dave niehaus call the game was a real treat as long as they keep ron fairly quite i doubt if anyone is better than niehaus  but that fairly guy is really annoying me  but i guess if clemens or viola had been pitching it would have  been a different story   two shutouts in two nights against the hottest best hitting team in major league baseball   pretty impressive in any league  man if johnson bosio and hanson keep going the mariners could be a  really interesting team to follow this year  also john cummings rookie has had three solid outings with no support  if fleming comes back  this may be the best starting staff in the american league this year relief is another story though  grimace  too cool  the first nohitter that i have been able to follow from  start to end  and again i think niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game  the guy is truly a joy to listen to  he deserves a pennant race   kent dietz twins in 00 mariners  if only they were an nl team  follow

     ive been a braves fan for as long as ive been watching baseball almost 00 years now  i say that just tp preface what im about to post  this braves team is made up of slow starters  people are amazed that the braves arent hitting  dont be  they werent hitting last year at this time nor were they the year before  they had slow aprils and mays in the 0000 and 0000 seasons  and yet they still managed to go to the series in those years  well this team is no different so why should we be suprised at their slow start  they started that way for the past two years and theyll be that way until the richmond club makes it to the majors  judge their offense in june or july when things start to average out  im just happy that the reds have gotten off to such a poor start  the giants always do well in the early part of the season but theyll be out of the race by july just like the last few years  unless bonds developes a knuckelball their staff will get rocked by midjune    wow you really know how to hurt a guy guess i shouldnt bother watching any more games its already been decided   luigi   randy palermo   luigicsdsgicom    fax 0000000000 silicon graphics computer systems 0000 n shoreline blvd mt view ca 00000 play an accordion go to jail thats the law  
  in article mssc0xb0i0cgnetcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer writes   i dont pretend to understand statistical analysis  well we agree on the last part   cool  and thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly namecalling of others      one of the basic things you need to  have in a statistic to be able to predict a players performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year  a  players batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year  ok  the basic problems with something like clutch batting average  overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero  adding to the sample size doesnt seem to help much  actually i think the largescale sample size is part of the problem it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to ba vs clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of bell curve  the xaxis being the  deviation in clutch hitting vs nonclutch  the yaxis being the number of players  certainly there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell  my supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players    as a counterexample to  what you showed consider the following two players from 00000000                 nonclutch                      clutch                ab      h       ba              ab      h       ba   maldonado      0000    000     000            000     00      000 lemon          0000    000     000            000     00      000  if you had had these two players in 0000 by your logic in those clutch situations youd bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye  well in  0000 maldonado hit 000 in nonclutch and 000 in clutch while lemon hit 000 in nonclutch and 000 in clutch  before you accuse me of  completely cooking the data  you wont hear those kind of accusations from me  it is interesting that you selected maldonado because he is someone whom i have also  looked at  he has been a very inconsistent hitter in terms of ba hitting in 0000  00  000 000 000 000    admittedly he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs  his clutch hitting  record is equally inconsistent  so for my purposes in 0000 i would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance  i dont know how i would have felt in 0000 but you may indeed be right    when i looked at sabo i found a more consistent record of hitting and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his nonclutch ba  ditto for joe carter  this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having with others on this topic  must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity  is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base   btw correlating players overall batting average from 0000 with 00 gives a correlation coefficient of 000 which is significant at something better than the 000 confidence level  correlating their clutchnonclutch ba for the same period gives a correlation of  0000 significant at no level of any interest  i completely accept that reasoning  again what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis   actually its technically incorrect to say that we cant predict future clutch performance  its more correct to say that we cant predict future clutch performance with any skill  amen    the beastmaster     mark singer     mssnetcomcom

  in article 0000apr0000000000000cscornelledu tedwardcscornelledu edward ted fischer writes  sigh  here we go again                       you started it  for predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless  at least if it has meaning we dont know how to find it  i did not say i could predict the future  you most certainly did  nonclutchclutch  abhbaabhba sabo000000000000000000 samuel000000000000000000  sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel  yet you would pinchhit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter  right  id call that predicting the future  if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel  im sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance  you just wouldnt have used this particular aspect of prior performance  is this not correct  right  i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past  overall performance lr splits even matching hittingpitching styles  all of these will give me some advantage if used properly  even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance  and in this case everything else pointed to sabo  one more time  i did not claim to be able to predict the future i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo  that comes down to the same thing  when perez left sabo in he was predicting the future the next ab  he was predicting that sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel  by supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite  and i am not dismissing your work  im stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work  well yes  you are aware of its existance  you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling  yet you rather forcefully state the opposite  you dont seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important id say this is insulting  i did not say that it is a consistent skill  i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances  right  this is the beef  it has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under any circumstances  at least none that weve been able to come up with  if you know of some where it is an indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret  it is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases  most certainly  as i have repeatedly stated if you can come up with a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability i would love it  however the straightforward attempts at such a study have all failed miserably  yeah  hindsight is always 0000  doesnt that make you bright  this is a stupid argument and you know it  ah  i knew we could get to the name calling  and theres that word you like so much  well it was a stupid argument  are you honestly debating that sure we know sabo didnt get a hit  we have no idea whether samuel would have done any better or not  one ab most certainly doesnt prove anything  i believe that by seasons end that chris sabos batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch situations  i cant prove that it will happen so i guess well  just have to wait and see  is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year  or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall  if you mean the first then as you say well just have to wait and see  but the second is a much stronger statement  in fact it suggests a rule  we can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years  i think you will agree that if the rule didnt work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do any better this year  right  heres another one for you  in 0000  0000 joe carters batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in nonclutch situations each year  i presume you think this is random    im not going to get into case analysis  sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit poorly in 00 as well  you can also find those who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit well in 00  no this doesnt prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of  major league ballplayers  it just makes me think that in 0000 joe carters batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in nonclutch situations  gamblers fallacy  unless there is reason to expect consistency a run proves nothing  can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next  ive seen a detailed study of why i shouldnt expect it to correlate  stupid  total idiot    my my  such hostility  the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid  and i dont see how you can deny it  as for total idiot  yes  if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely  so tell me  does the term fit  or do you have an open mind  valentine

  stuff deleted mattingly scores badly on both counts he doesnt get to very many balls and he lets a lot of balls go through the fact that he looks smooth has great hands and makes few errors means nothing this is traditional brainless reliance on observations that can easily be misled like a lot of bad fielders mattingly actually makes himself look better by not having any range hes nowhere near as bad as steve garvey but thats not much of a compliment   i agree with the flavor of this post but disagree with one specific argument  that has great hands means nothing  it seems to me that a firstbasemans defensive value is not entirely or even primarily from his ability to field grounders or catch popups  how many such chances does he get during a game  many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 0bss0b and p i mean the total of these is much higher than grounderpopup totals  this implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well even if they are high uptheline or in the dirt  good hands are needed for such plays and thus have value  i dont have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays but id guess that the values of these abilities are similar  its just like you dont judge catchers defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups but not as marked i suppose  michael

  to all the braves doubters  dont worry  the bats will come alive and the braves will come around the pitching is solid and as long the braves dont have serious injuries to the starting rotation theyll continue to pitch well  heck with the five starters on the braves rotation they could even sustain an injury to one of the five i hope this doesnt happen though  the bats are there pendleton will certainly bat over 000 justice is catching fire bream nixon sanders gant well theres too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer  right now the cleveland indians have 0 players batting over 000  but i certainly wouldnt their seven for our respective seven though wouldnt the braves be something right now with their pitching and 0 players batting over 000  the bullpen well it is suspect  but when the bats come alive the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern  so anyway i believe the braves will be tough to beat this season  im not saying the braves have automatically won the division but im optim istic about their season though its awful painful to watch them at times right now  go braves  dean

   actually i think the largescale sample size is part of the problem it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to ba vs clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of bell curve  the xaxis being the  deviation in clutch hitting vs nonclutch  the yaxis being the number of players  certainly there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell  right  most definitely  my supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players  this may be the root of the confusion  please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind  note that i am not yet saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand  suppose we have a simplified lotto game  you pick a number from 000 and win if that number is drawn  suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week  in the first year of the game approximately 00 of the population will win 0 or more times  in the second year of the game 00 of those 0time winners will again be 0time winners  in the third year of the game 00 of those who won 0 or more times in each of the first two years will win 0 again  suppose i started with 0000 people in my population  after three years i have 00 people who have consistently in each of the last three years won 000 or more the number of times expected  do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game no  because we know there is no skill involved  nothing about these consistent winners can influence their chances of winning  but suppose we dont know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved  perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic or something  how would we test this hypothesis  we can look for correlations in the population  now most of the population will show zero correlation  but our psychics should show a high positive correlation even if they arent very good psychics they should still manage to win 0 or more times most years  net result  a small positive correlation over the entire population  this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having with others on this topic  must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity  is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base  well zero correlation is zero correlation  you mention that sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last 0 years  but if we look at the past we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent  the length of the streak doesnt seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year  is there any reason to expect this streak to be different from past streaks  now if it were true that 00 of all threeyear streaks remained true to form then we might have something useful  but then we wouldnt have zero correlation  instead we have 00 of all threeyear streaks remain true to form and 00 of all threeyear streaks reverse  you look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year  but it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year since the probabilities are split 0000 each way  i completely accept that reasoning  again what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis   then we would have something useful  and we would also have a positive correlation  but for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses  cheers valentine  
  note  im not posting this as part of an argument with roger meynard but as an independent sort of thread  i do actually quote some things that roger meynard wrote but it might be better to think of this as sampling his post in the hiphop sense because it fits in with what i want to say  maynardramseycslaurentianca roger maynard writes but the point is that the only decision making pro cess  used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re lates to the teams  not the individual players  there is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances  and that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game  theres an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some peoples conception of a biological organism  in the biology context we would very likely read fitness for the score of the game and organisms for teams  how we interpret players is trickier but either organs or genes might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make  a genes interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case  but that would be a different and probably longer post  if however we take the organ view then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like species x is more fit than species y because of a better organ z  given what we know about the interdependence of organs we would often be suspicious of such claims  but note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map species x onto humans and organ z onto brain  on the other hand some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others as far as we can test them eg brain above might be more reasonable than pancreas assuming no gross pathology particularly if species y is a primate  even when you make such statements you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species  however if we are nonvitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable whole but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable  some of these processes might be localized to particular organs while others may be distributed across multiple organs  in a way this is just like a baseball team except that i think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are much simpler and less numerous than in most organisms  to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab solutely  that  player as team would have played better with player b in their lineup  sheer speculation  impossible to ascertain  one thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do  but of course this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty  most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research  if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has done better than another pitcher with those statistics as a criteria then fine  in this cases were seeing the word statistics means summary of observed events where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process and possibly inputs for other processes thus if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses  but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individuals contribution to winning the ws  because that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of baseball  this statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment you might be fit in one situation and not another  moving to baseball it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league  in at least a nominal sense the division winners are the fittest teams in the league in that they on average had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts  but in a real sense there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to or interesting for baseball  the same is true in biology  but here is also no direct biological equivalent of the world series in basebal  in the world series the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful  it might be fun to watch but its unclear what it all really means    now just one more unrelated point  i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon  on the other hand you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes and maybe some of us eg me who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis but this is probably only due to the fact that a 000game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops arent the only difference between the winners and the losers  moreover youve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the world series situation that makes the strong claim that nobody can predict the ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the wellknown home vs road effect on winning percentage  the stats are a nice hobby and thats about it  there is no new knowledge being produced    since stats are summaries of events its true that if you know the events you can derive the stats  but if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats then the stats produce new knowledge and some of this might even be reliable repeatable and useful  speaking of which i should get back to producing knowledge in a

     the subject line says it all what is the rule that qualifies  a pitcher as making a save  imho this is the most untrustworthy silly stat by todays rules in all  of baseball  my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot  pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least  appear in the ondeck circle  also the lead a pitcher enters with cannot  excede three runs  i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in  determining winnerssaversetc  for instance a pitcher can come in in the  ninth with a lead blow the lead fall behind have his team come back in  the next half inning and earn the win  has this pitcher earned a win no  way  i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his  teammates rally to tie the score  assume he came in to start the fourth  and left after the eighth  his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in  the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win  the  third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat  satisfaction  mike  i bleed the blue of dodgers and even like lasorda spaghetti sauce

   mark singer brings up the strawberry incident where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it   before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech  wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that  are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any   that are in the field of play  was the fan wrong  should he have  been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility  of interference   yes i think he should have done more to get out of the way  as much as fans want to catch a ball they really should be aware that winning the game is more important  as a dodger fan he has to be aware that this is the home stadium and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible  as soon as the ball was hit that far his first instinct should be to root for darryl to catch it not to try to catch it himself particularly when he is sitting that close  i enjoy the attitude of the wrigley fans where they are against  visiting team home runs so much they actually throw them back on the field  now this has nothing to do with whether darryl could have caught it or not  sure he probably screwed up but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win   daniel danielcalderauscedu

  ive been following the giants closely over the offseason  newspapers notesgroup etc  but i had my first up close and personal last night at the stick  after watching giants hitters struggle last year barrys swing was  very impressive  hes very quick and his swing seems effortless even compared to clark particularly clark as of late  it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well  im not sure if barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits 0b 0b hr for 0 rbis       the giants always hit maddux well but it was interesting that maddux did not pitch around bonds to get to clayton last night  he threw 0 straight fastballs over the plate to bonds in the 0st last night got away with the first one but bonds hit the second one out of the park  then in the 0rd when clark was at third base with one out maddux did not intentionally walk bonds and bonds dropped a single to leftcenter   the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to bonds  there has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better  claytons defense has been superb mcgee seems to like leading off this year  manwaring is driving the ball so on  so forth       the braves announcers pointed out that mcgee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet  he will always hit around 000 but im concerning about his onbase percentage  the key in the lineup is matt williams he has to stay hot so that bonds can hit with runners on base   i hope it continuesi think they need to continue well into june before people are really sold that they are for realparticularly the pitching       the pitching gets a set back as bud black is placed on the dl  burba has done a superb job filling in so far he looks like a different pitcher from last year  however swift is terrible in both of his starts  with burba moving into the rotation mike jackson is the only righthanded reliever aside from rod beck hell get a lot of actions  i also hope that dusty can manage his bullpen better than roger craig especially on beck i was concerned when beck was used for 0 straight days earlier this week   for myself i think the fresh start of magowanbakeretc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year       so far so good   edward hui

  i dont actually have the answer to this one  bosio after walking the first two batters retired 00straight for a backend perfect game  how many other games  including extra inning games  have seen a pitcher retire 00 straight excluding official perfect games  the only other instance of this i know about for sure is the famous ernie shore game which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in cooperstown shore came into the game when boston pitcher babe ruth got thrown out for arguing over the firstbatter walk shore picked him off and retired 00 straight after that  matt wall  wallccswarthmoreedu  hey i gotta job here ok  april 0 0000 boston red sox seize first place  
  just to add to this vein consider that range of a first baseman is not the only important thing  he is imo the best fielder of bad throws from the other infielders  i have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt catch balls off a large bounce take down balls over his head wide etc ad infinitum  and he gets the out much of the time  some of the things he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing  you have to give mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot near the bag yes i am sure he gets a few calls because he is mattingly        keith kellerlets go rangers kkellermailsasupenneduivy league champs      in this cornerlets go quakers      weighing in at almost every weight imaginable          life and all that surrounds it      blues traveler 0000

  punjabilelandstanfordedu sanjeev punjabi writes  some evidence that is not working  take a look at the standings its real easy to get so focussed on  minutinae and forget that the giants happen to be in first place if its working you dont screw it up by changing things just because you think it ought to be different  so that is the reason why the toronto blue jays should keep alfredo griffin just because it worked  a team winning doesnt mean that everything that its doing is right a team not winning doesnt mean that everything that its doing is wrong or otherwise to borrow the sharks situation you would say that george kingston should be fired  some folks like to argue about theoretical details i prefer to watch teams win when the giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange the batting order until then i think its stupid to focus on whats wrong for the simple fact that its working as it is  by then its too late  the problem with not fixing something while its working is that by then there may not be anything left to fix  mostly though the giants are winning and frankly as long as that continues its rather silly to secondguess their strategy but evidently some folks would rather be right than be first  so the blue jays were simply perfect last year there was nothing that they could have done to have improved that team  not   go california angels  nelson lu claudiuslelandstanfordedu

  in article mssc0y00d000netcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer writes quoted for future reference shown to be consistent in the past  overall performance lr splits even matching hittingpitching styles  all of these will give me some advantage if used properly  was predicting the future the next ab  he was predicting that sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel  he believed one of two things 0 sabo was more likely than samuel to get a hit or 0 that more good would be done in the long run by leaving sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome  in fact you dont know what perez had in mind when he left sabo in  by supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite  in fact i dont think anyone is claiming that they can predict the future or any particular future event  but we can believe that certain trends are due to a cause whether or not we have identified the cause and therefore will continue  and i am not dismissing your work  im stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work well yes  you are aware of its existance  you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling  yet you rather forcefully state the opposite  you dont seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important id say this is insulting  i think seeing insults in other peoples opinions is kind of silly after all mark didnt call you a total idiot or call your work stupid he simply stated that it didnt change his opinion on the  subject  i did not say that it is a consistent skill i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances right  this is the beef  it has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under any circumstances  at least none that weve been able to come up with  if you know of some where it is an indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret  if player a hits better on tuesdays and always has and mark believes that it might be an indication that he will hit on tuesday better next season as well would you respond the same way  at some point you might admit that all variable might not be known to you who knows what this guy does every monday night  maybe he sees his sports shrink on tuesday mornings or has his vitamin b shots monday nights  but this is something thats true of one guy only  it doesnt mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire league by days of the week nor that there should be  but it doesnt mean we cant make predictions based on that for that particular player  i believe that by seasons end that chris sabos batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch situations  i cant prove that it will happen so i guess well  just have to wait and see  is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year  or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall  i only see a prediction for one player here  i dont see anything about all batters  heres another one for you  in 0000  0000 joe carters batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in nonclutch situations each year  i presume you think this is random   im not going to get into case analysis  sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit poorly in 00 as well  you can also find those who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit well in 00  thats exactly what mark is trying to do though  find hitters that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions for these hitters based on their past performance  major league ballplayers  it just makes me think that in 0000 joe carters batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in nonclutch situations gamblers fallacy  unless there is reason to expect consistency a  huh  what does gamblers fallacy have to do with anything whether you can know the reason for correlation or not you cant deny that it has existent you can only make an argument that you dont think it is likely to continue to exist because you cant see a reason for it to exist  run proves nothing  can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next  ive seen a detailed study of  someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate the argument along the lines of star player with lr splits will always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game ie opposing manager will always bring in a ah pitcher to face him where his manager will not pull him for a ph  i dont see how you can deny it  as for total idiot  yes  if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely so tell me  does the term fit  or do you have an open mind  what about you  if the shoe fits will you wear it with an open mind  rudy

  can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make absolutely no sense  at least in the local gannett rag that finds its way to my door  i must have stared at cleman in the mets box for a good 00 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was  wouldnt it make more sense to use colemn  ive seen it as colmn also  blame the associated press  after the official scorer balances the official score card they copy it and give it to several diffent people  one of those is a person from ap whose job it is to type it up using a template on a laptop and transmit it to the ap offices in new york rockefeller center via the telephone  the box scores are not checked and just rebroadcasted over aps news delivery services  if there are corrections those are issued later  it is the person sitting in front of a laptop at shea or whereever whose fault that is  note the ap puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in most newspapers being the first one  last week they were in denver  maybe the ap person in denver did this remember they just started with mlb out there  check tomorrows paper 000 and see if the person who is doing it from shea does the same thing   scott barman     mets mailing list feed the following into your shell scottasdcom               mail metsrequestasdcom                              subscribe  lets go mets

  while were on the multipurpose subject lets not forget shea which was designed to accommodate both the mets  jets  it was the first stadium i think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football  minor point  shea stadium was designed as a multipurpose stadium but not with the jets in mind as the tennant  the new york football giants had moved to yankee stadium from the polo grounds in 0000 and was having problem with stadium management the city did not own yankee stadium until 0000  the idea was to get the giants to move into shea when a deal was worked out between the giants and the yankees the new afl franchise the new york titans approached the city about using the new stadium  the titans were playing in downing stadium where the cosmos played soccer in the 00s  because shea stadium was tied into the worlds fair anyway the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the worlds fair like they were doing with the mets  so the deal was worked out  of course with the jets gone to jersey and a truly good football stadium the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where because its circular the seats are almost always too far from the action  the mets announcerskiner  murphy in particularhave always hyped it as beautiful shea stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is  im under the impression that when murph says it he means it  as a regular goer to shea it is not a bad place since theyve cleaned and renovated the place  remember this is its 00th year   scott barman     mets mailing list feed the following into your shell scottasdcom               mail metsrequestasdcom                              subscribe  lets go mets

  mikefbvcedu writes in article 0000apr0000000000000newshubarielyorkuca cs000000arielyorkuca geoffrey e dias writes  the subject line says it all what is the rule that qualifies  a pitcher as making a save imho this is the most untrustworthy silly stat by todays rules in all  of baseball  my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot  pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least  appear in the ondeck circle  also the lead a pitcher enters with cannot  excede three runs  this is a phenomenon known around work as readyfireaim i am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only dont understand but publicly admit to not understanding in fact theres a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins  for the record there are two ways that a reliever can get a save he must finish the game and either 0 have entered the game with the tying run on base at bat or on deck 0 have pitched at least three innings effectively a pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game  i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in  determining winnerssaversetc  for instance a pitcher can come in in the  ninth with a lead blow the lead fall behind have his team come back in  the next half inning and earn the win  has this pitcher earned a win no  way  but this is an argument that wins is a dumb stat not saves  i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his  teammates rally to tie the score  assume he came in to start the fourth  and left after the eighth  his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in  the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win  the  third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat  satisfaction  this again doesnt support your claim about saves at the beginning of your post    mike jones  aix highend development  mjonesdonaldaixkingstonibmcom  conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design  frederick p brooks jr the mythical manmonth  
     the subject line says it all what is the rule that qualifies  a pitcher as making a save    as far as i know a save opportunity is when it is 0th inning or beyond and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game for example if it is the bottom of the 0th inning and clemens is pithching the red sox are leading 00 and clemens has just givin up a hit so there is a man on first the batter and the batter on deck could tie the game with a homer  if jeff russel came in the red sox reliever and finished the game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score he would get the save and clemens would get the win                                                                      thats how i beleive it works  hope i could help the cowboy

   ugliest swingi am not sure i think the ugliset stance is jolio franco of the ranger i wonder how that bat comes around in time to hit the ball it looks bad but heyit get the job done   tac   ugliest stance of all time has to go to oscar gamble the man would practically kneel in front of home plate in order to have a small strike zone hes just lucky that strike zone size isnt determined by how big your afro is  im outta here like vladimir alan  
   do you have a better email address mr lurie  im afraid i cant get the short version to work  in any case on winfield  yes his career ba is a mere 000  he didnt beat this until his sixth year in the majors and has only topped it once since 0000  his peak was in the early 00s and included some rather impressive seasons  but then hes also had other scattered great performances like 0000 and 0000  definitely not a smooth career curve  cheers valentine

entirely meaningless  at least if it has meaning we dont know how to find it  i did not say i could predict the future  you most certainly did  i really dont want to get into a didsodidnot debate with you  but this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement  i did not say  nor did i imply that i could predict the future  you have inferred that my comments meant this and you have based your rebuttal of my comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in regard to clutch hitting   sabo000000000000000000 samuel000000000000000000  sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel  yet you would pinchhit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter  right  id call that predicting the future  that is your opinion that sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel  the above data is for a 0year period ending last season last season samuel batted 000 while sabo hit 000 not park adjusted this season they are both hitting below 000 albeit sabo with more at bats  i will agree that over his career sabo has been a better hitter than samuel but i will also remind you that samuel has been a better hitter in certain situations than sabo  i did not predict that sabo would choke nor that samuel would get a hit  i expressed my opinion that had i been the reds manager or even a reds fan that i would prefer to have samuel hit in that situation than sabo   if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel  im sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance  you just wouldnt have used this particular aspect of prior performance  is this not correct  right  i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past  overall performance lr splits even matching hittingpitching styles  all of these will give me some advantage if used properly  ah  properly  yes  i see  even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance  and in this case everything else pointed to sabo  please help me  what exactly is everything else that pointed to sabo   well yes  you are aware of its existance  you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling  yet you rather forcefully state the opposite  you dont seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important id say this is insulting  i must say i was not aware of the publication  can you email me the information regarding its availability  and i guess i must apologize to all of those who have done extensive  study on say supply side economics  i didnt mean to insult you but i never did believe you were on the right path  im sorry for my contrary opinionposition  i also regret that i dont have the ability to prove that you are wrong  but you are    i believe that by seasons end that chris sabos batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch situations  i cant prove that it will happen so i guess well  just have to wait and see  is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year  or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall  it is what it says it is  if you mean the first then as you say well just have to wait and see  but the second is a much stronger statement  in fact it suggests a rule  we can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years  i think you will agree that if the rule didnt work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do any better this year  right   the second is your statement not mine   im not going to get into case analysis  sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit poorly in 00 as well  you can also find those who hit poorly from 0000 and then hit well in 00  well actually i havent yet  but im not finished looking that is i havent yet found someone who hit significantly below his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years  0000  00 and then reversed that relationship in 0000   gamblers fallacy  unless there is reason to expect consistency a run proves nothing  can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next  ive seen a detailed study of why i shouldnt expect it to correlate  nope  sorry  but if you were interested in a reason why i expect chris sabos ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could  if you were interested in a reason why i expect joe carters ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could  but youre not interested in that because you think that those conclusions could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire baseball population  and they cant be   the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid  and i dont see how you can deny it  as for total idiot  yes  if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely  the problem here is that i do believe you  i accept your work i believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based on prior clutch history is meaningless  no better than a coin toss i actually do accept your work  as it happens i also have an opinion that in certain situations for certain players a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in projecting future player performance  for that player and chris sabo is one such player   so tell me  does the term fit  or do you have an open mind  well since i defer to your statistical wisdom i think i must have an open mind  now we have to pose the same question

  in article mssc0y0u00dnnetcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer writes  my supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players  this may be the root of the confusion  please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind  note that i am not yet saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand  suppose we have a simplified lotto game  detailed explanation deleted   indeed you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement to  rebut my opinion you have made an analogy with a game of chance your hypothesis assumes that the lotto players have no impact on the selection of the numbers and hence their ability to win  well thats certainly true in lotto  but it has absolutely nothing to do with the sport of baseball  when you start down the wrong path you finish down the wrong path      i repeat  i do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting performance  i do however think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance may for some players indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance and i think chris sabo is such a player     the beastmaster    mark singer     mssnetcomcom

   amazingly pitchers no matter how good their mechanics are not machines  cy young winners dont pitch in a vaccuum unaware of how their offenses are doing  the braves pitching staff is already showing signs of cracking under the strain of knowing theyre not going to get many if any runs  unfortunately the braves pitchers were so bad for so long that the organization put so much stress and i mean stress on pitching that they completely ignored hitting  the braves right now are looking woefully similar to the braves of the midseventies  heaven help us     econdukeedu     flsecondukeedu     flsecondukeedu    flseconduke s  to my correspondents  my email has been changed                       e l                         my new address is  flsecondukeedu            d f            if mail bounces try flsraphaelacpubdukeedu               u  
   the term stopper is generally used to refer to a pitcher one who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going on a losing streak  the braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description although right now id expect smoltz or glavine to take the mantle  what the braves lack however is an offensive stopper somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump theres just no one there  the braves got rid of their best pure hitter lonnie smith and only terry pendleton on the current roster has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit  oh and another thing that worries me  ron gant seems to have slowed down a step  thats scary  a slow ron gant doesnt have much going for him   econdukeedu     flsecondukeedu     flsecondukeedu    flseconduke s  to my correspondents  my email has been changed                       e l                         my new address is  flsecondukeedu            d f            if mail bounces try flsraphaelacpubdukeedu               u

  in article cjkuo000symanteccom cjkuosymanteccom jimmy kuo writes   gt0000eprismgatechedu michael andre mule writes     what is the maximum runs allowed before a stopper can get credit for a   relief ie if a stopper comes in with a 0 run lead does he getcredit    with the save   if you come in and pitch the last three inningsand your team was ahead    when you got out there and wins the game you get a save   sorta correct if you pitched at least 0 inningsentered with your team    in the lead was the pitcher when the game endedthe game was never tied    during your stint and your team won you get a save  well the rulebook says that in the opinion of the scorer you must have  pitched effectively for your 0 innings  this save is not automatic  unlike the others  someone in sabr actually looked at these games a few years ago  and found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one  of the games  even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly  allowing 0 or 0 runs  seeing hearing my two sense worth john rickert rickertnextworkrosehulmanedu  
   right  so who cares which player gets credited as long as the team gets more runs  if a player helps the team get more r and rbi but  doesnt score them all himself who cares  amusing isnt it  seems only the sdcns realize how much baseball is a team game combining efforts from every player for the win  consider the red sox game last night  the sox won 00 in the bottom of the 00th  who won the game  clemens pitched a strong nine  innings allowing only two runs ryan pitched a couple shutout innings though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so quantrill pitched a couple of innings gave up the goahead run and  got credited with the win when the sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning  looks like a team effort to me  yet only quantrill got credit for the win  how about the offense dawson and vaughn hit i think hrs early in the game  without either  one the sox would have lost in nine quintana led off the 00th with a solid single zupcic pinchran for quintana providing the speed to go from first  to third when cooper ripped a second single in the inning melvin avoided the dp getting the run home with a sac fly  not much of  a help but it was something scrub richardson then hit a double scoring the speedy cooper all the  way from first  hills lack of defense helped  cooper and zupcic were credited with runs melvin and richardson were credited with rbis  but it seems to me that it was quintanas hit that set up the whole inning  and did melvin really contribute as much as richardson  furthermore people seem to consider rbis to be more significant than runs  did melvin contribute more than cooper  cooper provided the gamewinning baserunner and moved the tying run to third base with only one out  assigning credit based on runs and rbis is clearly ridiculous  you can argue that obp and slg dont show you who came through in the clutch but rrbi dont do any better  at least obp and slg dont claim to try to tell you that  heres to the red sox who contributed to last nights victory all 00 of them  valentine

mike lavalliere has been accused of poor work habits and general sloth recently probably not malingering just as he was being released  its interesting that nobody heard much about these problems before if they were so important  i have heard sanders called many things as well i have not heard him called lazy given the 0sport phenomenon it would be difficult to label him as such  exactly so  which means his media detractors have had to say other things about him  i believe its a general phenomenon that if writers dont like you theyll find a label that will stick no matter who you are  i find myself more interested in the selection of labels than in why writers feel they need to act this way  not that this fascinates me that much either  uh the original authors point was that black and white players were por trayed differently by the media and towards this he gave a highly selected list to prove his case sanders name showed up eventually i dispute that sanders has ever been called lazy by the media   hmm big ego possible club house disturbance etc is that good press  no but it isnt the total extent of the press he received in pittsburgh where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and spoiled by the local columnists  again the actual words used may shift around with time and expediency but lazy tends to be higher on the list for nonwhite players at least in my subjective opinion  aside it might be interesting for somebody to do an archival study on player descriptions before and after the color barrier was broken and on teams like the red sox which have been traditionally white nowadays most people think of carl yastrzemski as one of those bluecollar hardworking guys but in the early 00s he was often portrayed as a lazy bum  really  hmm i never heard anyone accuse canseco of being lazy nor sierra  ive heard accusations that canseco was a bad fielder but could be a great one if he put his mind to it  ignoring whether or not he is a  actually dave stewart is was one of the most vocal about this in any  event that is not lazy  at least one poster in the last week has fired off a major screed on the cansecoislazy issue so i think your point is at best a quibble and probably weaker than that  uh that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first it is not a quibble then to state that the media did not portray canseco as being  lazy if the other person chooses to so accuse him after my post that does not make it a quibble and in fact the media around here tended to play up his time in the wieght room hardly lazy and hardly a quibble have you ever seen any mediot portray canseco as lazy unconcerned with his fielding yes lazy no  bad fielder i think this is still interesting  for that matter i think cansecos colorful offfield antics get lots more national attention than those of say roger clemens  well hes had a few more of them  at least more that youve heard about  i think one of the questions here surrounds selective reporting  having said that i have to say that the selective reporting hypothesis has the potential to be unfalsifiable at least by those of us who arent reporters police or private investigators  well canseco has been involved in several felonies including his highspeed record carrying concealed firearms and of course the domestic violence  clemens had a runin at a bar canseco had that as well and in both cases the coverage was relatively minimal  puckett stewart jackson   i said overrepresent nonwhites  three anecdotal data points dont make an interesting counterargument  btwwhich jackson are we talking about here  reggie bo darrin danny or   uh if the only evidence offered is anecdotal how can it be objected that the counter to it is also anecdotal  and it seems like everybody who has ever won a batting title among others has been accused at some time of caring more for his own stats than for the good of the team  it also seems to me that youre  kirby puckett i have never heard this accusation made of puckett i  have heard it of boggs actually i believe it of him but thats another  matter  not living in minnesota i cant say whether or not this line has ever been used against kirby there  as far as boggs goes im not sure why you bring him up since hes one of the obvious prototypes for the line i quoted along with ted williams rod carew and many others  uh yes and i agree with your assesment of boggs rather specifically however you did say everybody who has ever won a batting title has been accused of selfishness i have not ever anywhere heard this said of puckett pendleton either similarly brett b williams and others    how about daryl strawberry and i think the plus or minus refers more to  the born again types ie butler and gaetti  again you seem to be making an argument from anecdotes  on the other hand my argument by is of the becausejonsaysso variety if we have no other data  i have to admit i have problems generating lists of nonwhite players who became infamous for their religious or political beliefs while names like butler gaetti dravecky knepper hersheiser et al come rolling out  there are others perhaps they are simply not as outspoken except in the case of the bornagain types i mention  mike

  about the infield fly rule so if hes feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up  if it isnt caught hes probably scored a run  if it is hes probably headed for aaa    unless hes deion sanders in which case he just heads back to the dugout and waits for his next baserunningblunder opportunity   econdukeedu     flsecondukeedu     flsecondukeedu    flseconduke s  to my correspondents  my email has been changed                       e l                         my new address is  flsecondukeedu            d f            if mail bounces try flsraphaelacpubdukeedu               u

   the best home run i have ever seen came off believe it or not roger clemens sorry val a couple of years ago he threw a ball to incaviglia which was literally at inkys neck and he absolutely  hammered the crap out of it after the swing clemens nonchalantly motioned for a new ballhe didnt even turn around to look or even get upset the ball hit the lights in the leftfield standard some 00 or so feet about the green monster over 000 feet above the ground total  truly an amazing shot  i agree  home runs off clemens are always memorable  kinda like eclipses and hurricanes  they dont happen very often  cheers valentine

  in article 0000apr0000000000000vflparamaxcom davidmgvls0vflparamaxcom david madden writes     0 if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time x  0 to 0       without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base       as if walked  this last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases considerably  suppose the pitcher uses up n0 of his n pickoff attempts  the runner can probably stretch his lead off the base given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it right this time   if it encouraged the runner to stretch his lead it would probably also result ina greater number of pickoffs i think it would be a workable rule but it would probably be best to experiment in another league before trying it in the bigs  clay d

  keller writes  real long but good post on yankee trades omitted    i disagree on one point  velarde  yes maybe the yanks should have let  him develop but he rode the columbus shuttle way too many times to do   so  probably the fault of george but no matter now  his usefulness is   done  he will not be able to develop into a good player this deep in his   career  at least i dont think so  his fielding is horrendous at 0rd maybe  hed be good at short he cant his the curve at all and i think all  his trips from new york to columbus and back have demoralized him to the  point that he just doesnt care  get rid of him i saythe sooner the  better for both the yanks and velarde          keith kellerlets go rangers     velarde hasnt been to columbus if i recall for about three years  granted he hasnt been a full time player but when he does play ive always thought he had a good bat he might be demoralized about not playing full time but he hasnt been shuttled around  i think hes been in new york ever since he had 00 hits in 000 ab back in 0000 or 00 i believe   i dont think he is gold glove calibre but he doesnt boot it around either  i think if velarde is given a chance he could become extremely productive  i dont have any stats to back this up and i dont know if his defense would cost any games but i think he could help  and he has this year  he has 0 hr already  same goes for jim leyrtiz  he has a big mouth but he does get the job done when he concentrates  i think the situation with leyritz is that he believes he is a potential superstar and he gets pissed about not playing  i think he might have realized something when the marlins or rockies didnt select him the yanks need to worry about the bullpen right now kamieniecki and wickmanmilitello in the bullpen ouch  im praying that the bp will return to last years form     chris               what im listening to                     giantwamumdedu                                                                    anything that guitar god                                 go yankees        dann huff plays on                            
   rule 000k states it is interference by a batter or runner when  in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base  he runs outside the threefoot line or inside to the left of the foul line and in the umpires judgment interferes with the field er taking the throw at first base  the key word in the rule is and a runner isnt out just for running out of the baseline hes out for interfering with the fielding of the ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first because the catcher opted to throw the ball over the batterrunners head theres no inter ference  sorry i still dont buy it  youre certainly right that the runner is not out merely for running out of the baseline he must interfere with the play  but the argument here is over what constitutes interference you certainly cannot infer from what youve quoted that the batterrunner must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference you havent posted a definition of interference at all  imo this calls for one of the approved rulings that go in small print in the rulebook  something like  approved ruling if in the judgement of the umpire the runner by running to the left of the allowed path caused the fielder to make a bad throw blocks the vision of the fielder receiving the throw or otherwise impedes the defensive teams making a play on him the batterrunner shall be judeged guilty of interference  or  approved ruling the runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball   in the absence of such an approved ruling i claim that this is a poor rules trivia questionsince it cannot be authoritatively answered   len reed holos software inc voice 000 0000000 ext 00 domain lbrholosatlgausa   uucp lbrholos0uucp

  this chatting about the best player of all time is pointless  you cant compare players from different eras    of course you can  you just have to be careful about what conclusions you draw  if you will notice the best pitchers stat wise were in the 00s and 00s and the best all around hitters probably came from the 00s to 00s    huh  the 00s and 00s were the worst decades for great pitching  grove vance dean and not a whole lot else    as for the best allaround hitters statwise ruth gehrig foxx greenberg hornsby cobb etc all played before the 00s  statwise the 00s were  a graveyard for hitters  now we have a great number of great pitchers and an equally great number of great hitters and fielders also  how do you know  which ones do you consider great  about fielding the gloves were much smaller than they are now in the early years of baseball  maybe a hitter like sheffield with the 000 ba 00hr and 000 rbieven though it was probably a fluke year can be compared to a mantle because the pitching sheffield faces is faster and not to mention better the  so  sheffield also has better shoes  more time between pitches  you can run the comparison but there are lots of things to take into account  same could be said for frank thomas who is said to be the best hitter since ted williams although franks defense does suck  well can we compare them or cant we  all i am saying is that you cant compare players from different eras if you want a best player try choosing best players from different eras that  why  we can compare players to the standard of their era and we can keep in mind eratoera differences without throwing up our hands in despair  way there is reasonable basis for comparison  you havent shown us whats unreasonable about the mantlesheffield comparison that you yourself did  roger  
  i feel that talking about speeding up baseball games is like trying to keep signal to noise ratio high on recsportsbaseball  no matter how much you talk about it or how reasonable your arguments there will always be people who quote an entire article with signatures to make a one line comment reply or woof  whether through their stupidity denseness or excitement and overeagerness to bless us with their insight no matter what is said they will always keep doing it  same with ballgames  no matter how much it might benefit the game for the umpires to enforce the rules and for the playersmanagerscoaches to stop wasting our time  it just aint gonna happen  rudy  i agree  
  craigesadhpcom craig eid writes  these things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real  businessman ex  safeway president peter magowan to figure it out just  like he used to tell his checkers if the customers dont come back i dont need as many checkers this isnt a knock on bob lurie  he was a competent businessman but he didnt deal much with the general public  interesting article craig  its amazing how hard it is to get baseball teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their customers  no other business could ever get away with the 00th century  attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs  i guess the owners look at baseballs high growth rate and ask why its necessary to bring 00th century business practices into the game but they dont realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they pay in terms of longterm popularity by not doing better by the game and its fans  greg

   the reason im unhappy with the length of games today is summed up above for an extra 00 minutesgame average in the al and an extra 00 minutes average in the nl im seeing fewer runs score   now what i think i am seeing is more pitches  more strikeouts over 0game in the al over 0game more in the nl more walks 0game more in  yep  and the ks dont have to denote a slow game either  last night sid fernandez was mowing the giants hitters down 00 ks in 0 innings yet the first 0 00 innings of the game were quite brisk  he also threw 000 pitches leading me to believe it isnt just the number of pitches that determines the length of a game but the  behavior between pitches      michael zimmers                                      voice  000 000 0000   softhelp  suppliers to software developers         data   000 000 0000

   i dont understand this at all  matt williams has demonstrated throughout his career that he will not wait for good pitches to hit he wont take walks  hed rather swing  if im the opposing pitcher why would i groove a fastball to williams and have him hit it well when i know that williams will swing and miss or at least not hit very well at a low and away curve  matts problem is really more ability than attitude  it isnt that hes got it in his mind that he wants to swing away but rather that hes still a total sucker for the curve ball  it looked for a while in 0000 that he was getting better but its still his weak point  as to whether it does him any good to have bonds behind him the  netstatmavens will probably tell you theres no reason that it should but if he thinks it will it might be a selffulfilling prophecy  as to whether the giants lineup is optimal  who knows  batting bonds the teams best hitter fifth does seem to be odd but the 0 and 0 hitters arent exactly messrs oba so they arent giving much up there  and although clark isnt the overall offensive force that bonds is he seems better suited to the 0 spot  assuming of course that he starts hitting one of these days      michael zimmers                                      voice  000 000 0000   softhelp  suppliers to software developers         data   000 000 0000

  whittycvhpcom joe whitty writes  thomas theiner theindamabusinformatikrwthaachende wrote  hi there    im german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now  there are many problems occuring for me one of them is the era statistic for  pitchers what does it say   era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game  thus if a pitcher pitched 0 innings and gave up 0 earned run his 0 inning equivelent perfomance would be 0 earned runs thus his era is 000  to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 0  era  erip  0  i think there is another formula for era  i heard something about it last  year  im not sure what it is but im gonna give it a stab  it allows for a pitcher to pitch more than 0 innings at a time and not benefit cuz it uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched          era  er00outs recorded  like i said im not sure this is exactly it but im pretty sure they changed it to something of the sort   an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error  more specifically if an error occurs that represented the third out all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game  here are some examples  if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base  if an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after this error and not counted as earned runs  if a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who were left on base  if the those runners who were left on base score and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game  i hope this explains things for you  joe

   this weeks play    it took three days to get to us but ill try anyway as i naturally havent seen the answer   with runners at first and second and one out the batter hits an  easy pop fly to the third baseman    a the umpires declare the infield fly rule and the third baseman  lets the ball drop the runner at second heads for third and the  third baseman flips the ball to the short stop who tags the bag  before the runner  safe the correct call is infield fly batter out if fair runners may advance at own risk gotta tag up if caught etc it is not a force and the pop was not caught so regardless of whether the ss tags 0b or 0b it wasnt clear above he hasnt got the runner out   b the umpires dont declare the infield fly rule and the third  baseman allows the ball to drop and throws to the short stop who  tags the runner from second while the runner is between second and  third  out see rule 000l approved ruling below in this case the umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule doesnt apply sounds like a bad call here but thats not the point the batter is not out so a force situation is created therefore the runner is out   unless by rule 000l the ball is dead and the batter is safe then i guess the runners would advance unmolested  i cant really tell from 000l that the ball is dead in this situation     whats the call in a and b  pertinent rules 000 definition of infield fly when an infield fly is called runners may advance at their own risk if on an infield fly rule the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball the ball remains in play despite the provisions of rule 000l the infield fly rule takes precedence  000l a batter is out when an infielder intentionally drops a fair fly ball or line drive with first first and second first and thrid or firstsecond and third base occupied before two are out the ball is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base or bases approved ruling in this situation the batter is not out if the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground except when the infield fly rule applies    jim dean internet jimdeanbnrca     national capital baseball league mildmannered computer scientist phone president pitcher my knuckler bellnorthern research ottawaont booth    not too legit to hit  00 000 phone 000 0000000 fax 0000000     phone 000 0000000

  is it just me or does bichette look totally lost in the outfield  hes been playing horrible defense baylor said after wednesdays game that he wanted to shake up the lineup a little because bichette has been having a rough time defensively and jerald clark has not been hitting he was true to his word i went to thursdays game and gerald young was in right and daryl boston who has a very hot bat was in left baylor was careful to say though that he didnt necessarily mean for these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two a shot while clark and bichette were not playing well  in defense of bichette it looks like right field in mile high stadium is a bitch to play some of the visiting outfielders have been having some problems too although bobby bonilla made a great catch crashing into the wall to rob daryl boston of an extra base hit in thursdays game  greg  
     huckabays counting frames for bat speed discussion ommited     well its just studying tape frame by frame  thats all  the biggest  thing that you notice however is how bastardized the strike zone has   become  death to the umpires union  the plate is 00 0 across  not 00  call the high strikes strikes and quit calling pitches 0  outside strikes  theyre balls      speaking of this 00 wide strike zone    id sure like to see cameras placed in each major league park such that    an overview shot of home plate is available  cbs had this during the   ws or did i just dream it    these pictures would be a feedback device for the umpires so that they can   see just how terrible or not there calls were  tapes could be sent to   the league as evidence of bad ballstrike umpiring  tapes are available   as evidence of bad outsafe calls on the bases  i guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series and in fact all year have been pretty much consistently correct  remember the rule says its a strike if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone  i would certainly agree that  high strikes are not called who could argue this point but all in all i think in and out is called pretty well   rstimets

  behrensccswarthmoreedu eric behrens writes   the babe and the pride of the yankees offer very different renditions of the sotry about ruth and gherig hitting home runs for the boy in the hospital  can some historian out there explain historys version of the story    i wouldnt put is past either or both of the movies to season the truth with a little extra spice  any other comments as to inaccuracies in these two movies       good question  i kind of wondered about this myself  just one thought i had on it    the babe himself was in pride of the yankees which made me think  a that version may be closer to the truth and  b the babe must have been a pretty good gut to be in the movie even though some of the scenes didnt make him look completely flattering    chris roney  email chrisroneysfuca  
  might i suggest that a more appropriate forum for gamebygame highlights of a particular team is a mailing list rather than recsportbaseball   i looked up might to see why you selected that particular word and discovered the line    to express permission liberty probability possibility     it also said something about being a polite alternative to may  the presence of probability possibility can certainly be used to partially explain your word selection   so id say to all extents and purposes yes you might  in fact you did not that you were asking me specifically  the next question is why would a mailing list be more appropriate we dont all get mailing lists  we surely dont all get mailing lists about the teams about which we are most enthused  so it seems to me rsbaseball is an appropriate place to look for information about teams one doesnt necessarily follow daytoday  this is not intended as flamage but rather is an attempted answer as you posed your post as a question   it bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait bait ba a                                                                    i b              anyone for lemur sooshi                              t     thats sushi  learn to spell you pathetic winker   
  i heard that eli is selling the team to a group in cinninati this would help so that the os could make some real free agent signings in the  offseason training camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now the backup catcher postion will be a showdown between tackett and parent although i would prefer parent 0 draft pick jeff hammonds may be coming up faster in the os hierarchy of the minors faster than expected mike flanagan is trying for another comeback big ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half this may be bens year  i feel that while this may not be mussinas cy young year he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around august i really hope baines can provide the rf support the os need orsulak was decent but i had hoped that chito martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in 00 the os right now dont have many lefthanded hitters anderson proving last year was no fluke and cals return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant the  rotation should be sutcliffe mussina mcdonald rhodes  olson is an interesting case will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs you never know the way i see the al east this year with personal biases mixed in baltimore new york toronto milwaukee cleveland boston detroit the top 0 are the only true contenders in my mind one of these 0 will definitely win the division unless it snows in hellmaryland  i feel that this baltimores season to finally put everything together  admiral steve c liu        internet address admiraljhunixhcfjhuedu committee for the liberation and intergration of terrifying organisms   and their rehabilitation into society from red dwarf  polymorph      the bangles are the greatest female rock band that ever existed    this sig has been brought to you by frungy the sport of kings
