1, i3150101 dbstu1.rz.tu-bs.de benedikt rosenau subject re americans and evolution in article 1pq47tinn8lp senator-bedfellow.mit.edu bobs thnext.mit.edu robert singleton writes deletion i will argue that your latter statement `` i believe that no gods exist '' does rest upon faith that is if you are making a positive statement that `` no gods exist '' strong atheism rather than merely saying i don't know and therefore do n't believe in them and do n't not believe in then weak atheism once again to not believe in god is different than saying i believe that god does not exist i still maintain the position even after reading the faqs that strong atheism requires faith no it in the way it is usually used in my view you are saying here that driving a car requires faith that the car drives for me it is a conclusion and i have no more faith in it than i have in the premises and the argument used but first let me say the following we might have a language problem here in regards to `` faith '' and '' existence '' i as a christian maintain that god does not exist to exist means to have being in space and time god does not have being god is being kierkegaard once said that god does not exist he is eternal with this said i feel it 's rather pointless to debate the so called `` existence '' of god and that is not what i 'm doing here i believe that god is the source and ground of being when you say that `` god does not exist '' i also accept this statement but we obviously mean two different things by it however in what follows i will use the phrase `` the existence of god '' in it's 'usual sense and this is the sense that i think you are using it i would like a clarification upon what you mean by `` the existence of god '' no that 's a word game the term god is used in a different way usually when you use a different definition it is your thing but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way i define god is ... and that does not exist it is existence itself so i say it does not exist interestingly there are those who say that `` existence exists '' is one of the indubitable statements possible further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are implying more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete making it a fallacy deletion one can never prove that god does or does not exist when you say that you believe god does not exist and that this is an opinion '' based upon observation '' i will have to ask `` what observtions are you refering to '' there are no observations pro or con that are valid here in establishing a positive belief deletion where does that follow are n't observations based on the assumption that something exists and would n't you say there is a level of definition that the assumption '' god is '' is meaningful if not i would reject that concept anyway so where is your evidence for that `` god is '' is meaningful at some level benedikt

1, kempmp phoenix.oulu.fi petri pihko subject re concerning god 's morality long this kind of argument cries for a comment ... jbrown batman.bmd.trw.com wrote in article 1993apr3.095220.24632 leland.stanford.edu galahad leland.stanford.edu scott compton writes jim you originally wrote ... god did not create disease nor is he responsible for the maladies of newborns what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~ do you have any evidence for this if the code was once perfect and has degraded ever since we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement should n't we perhaps the biggest `` imperfection '' of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions introns which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions exons an impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains is the number of introns decreasing or increasing it appears that intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes on the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted later presents several logical difficulties introns are removed by a splicing mechanism this would have to be present but unused if introns are inserted moreover intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting random insertion would not be tolerated since sequences for intron removal self-splicing of mrna are conserved besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace long terminal repeats and target site duplications and these are not found in or near intron sequences i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting `` theological arguments '' like this try watson 's molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish baltimore 's molecular biology of the cell for starters remember the question was posed in a theological context why does god cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective -- my own it is no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion i think you misread my meaning i said god made the genetic code perfect but that does n't mean it 's perfect now it has certainly evolved since for the worse would you please cite a few references that support your assertion your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence in fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we 've thought for instance sex might have evolved as defence against parasites this view is supported by computer simulations of evolution eg tierra perhaps i thought it was higher energy rays like x-rays gamma rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage in fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action actually neither of us `` knows '' what the atmosphere was like at the time when god created life according to my recollection most biologists do not claim that life began billion years ago -- after all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth was created it would still be too primitive to support life i seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to billion years ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with a better estimate i 'd replace `` created '' with `` formed '' since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one most recent estimates of the age of the earth range between 4.6 4.8 billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but organic stromatolite-like layers date back to 3.5 billion years this would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve i 'm sorry i ca n't give any references this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i attended here dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterial/viral and genetic although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this again do you _want_ this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed `` degeneration '' i can understand scott 's reaction excuse me but this is so far-fetched that i know you must be jesting do you know what pathogens are do you know what point mutations are do you know that everything can come about spontaneously in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you can not know that i hope you do n't forget this we have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against this conclusion in science one does not have to _believe_ in anything it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one 's own conclusions prior to this theology does not use this method therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions human dna being more `` complex '' tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is a bad combination hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases/disorders you are supposing a purpose not a valid move bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease they are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution only replication saves replicators from degradiation we are just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate the less efficient methods did n't make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for your claim that human dna is degrading through evolutionary processes some people have claimed that the opposite is true we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade i have n't seen much evidence for either claim but then i ask so where is this relevant to my discussion in answering john 's question of why why are there genetic diseases and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require babies to develop antibodies is it god 's fault the original question -- i say no it is not of course nothing `` evil '' is god 's fault but your explanation does not work it fails miserably you may be right but the fact is that you do n't know that satan is not responsible and neither do i. suppose that a powerful evil being like satan exists would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills that affect mankind i do n't think so he could have done a much better job pun intended the problem is it seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution did i say that where seems to me like another bad inference actually what you 've done is to oversimplify what i said to the point that your summary of my words takes on a new context i never said that people are `` meant '' presumably by god `` to be punished by getting diseases '' why i did say is that free moral choices have attendent consequences if mankind chooses to reject god as people have done since the beginning then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic universe i am not expecting this if god exists i expect him to leave us alone i would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free this is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be what consequences would you expect from rejecting allah oh i admit it 's not perfect yet but i 'm working on it a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point what does this have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provided an answer biology and genetics are fine subjects and important scientific endeavors but they explain how god created and set up life processes they do n't explain the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution why is there a `` why behind '' and your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence this is why we recommend these books is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological theories hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this thanks scotty for your fine and sagely advice but i am not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details of biology and genetics although i 'm sure i 'd find it a fascinating subject for i realize that the details do not change the big picture that god created life in the beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its environment i 'm sorry but they do there is no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation it can

6, document_id from daniels neosoft.com brad daniels subject re c++ toolkit `` directions '' in article imp.hellnet.org devil loki.hellnet.org gil tene writes i am trying to figure out the current c++ toolkit `` directions '' more simply i 'd like to know which c++ toolkit to `` bet on '' for use in a new long term project i have the same problem i have looked at motif++ wwl interviews gina++ and a few variations on the above i 've also done a cursory examination of rogue wave 's view.h++ i like view.h++ 's abstractions best of all of the toolkits i mentioned but the resulting code looks little like motif and i have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code gina++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance but the resulting code is almost too motif-like and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent c code interviews looks promising but i have n't found a free version with motif support and i'm not confident how widely interviews with motif support will be adopted and what if any specific motif support will be available over time the other libraries produce code which is less motif-like but which does not make sufficient use of the features of c++ to simplify my coding task at this point my inclination is to write my motif manipulation routines in c and invoke those routines from my c++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task later if osf or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a c++ interface to motif i will change to that it does me no goo to write in c++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions it 's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now views.h++ is the only library i 'd consider right now but in our environment we 'd end up spending nearly to use it and i ca n't justify it when it 's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the j curve brad -- brad daniels `` if money ca n't buy happiness daniels neosoft.com i guess i 'll have to rent it '' i do n't work for neosoft and weird al yenkovic do n't speak for my employer

11," document_id from seth cbnewsh.cb.att.com peter.r.clark .. jr subject flyers notes 4/5 the flyers team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the spectrum sunday night and dominated the maple leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs from mounting any serious attack injuries pelle eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh roster moves jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game jason was the flyers second pick in the first round 15th overall of the entry draft years old '' lbs in games with the tri-city americans he had goals assists and pim he plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although bobby taylor said that bill dineen was planning to use him up front as well andre faust was returned to hershey he actually left after the second period of the kings game flew to albany got the game tying goal in a bears ot win and played again for hershey sunday night lines fedyk-lindros-recchi beranek-brind'amour-dineen lomakin-butsayev-conroy acton-brown galley-mcgill yushkevich-cronin carkner-hawgood bowen tommy soderstrom in goal acton replaced lomakin in the 3rd period game summary if the flyers played like this every night they 'd be in the playoffs this year the flyers hit everything that moved they created scoring chance after scoring chance they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found brind'amour crashing the net on the other side a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppa 's body should have been a goal but puppa made a great save reading the play garry galley gave the maple leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked doug gilmour at 4:25 the flyers lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill the maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every rebound after the power play the flyers got a goal on an ugly play rod brind'amour gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef beranek and bob rouse who were wrestling in the slot beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over puppa for a 1-0 flyers lead at 8:10 the flyers kept the pressure on and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers from building on their lead for a while eventually things settled down and defense prevailed each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were strong bowen started giving some lindros-like checks in his own corners then lindros who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the score he had foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice boards the only problem was that foligno was a little far from the boards and mike `` mister '' mcgeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38 the leafs could n't get anything going on the power play as the flyers were very aggressive for a change on the kill with time running out in the period recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to lindros as they approached the leaf 's blue line they were in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros tried a backhand pass to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi but then clark checked recchi off the puck macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to mcgill who had manned the point he drove it from just inside the blue line macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1 shots were 13-8 flyers in the period the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk tripped up rod brind'amour in his offensive zone during the power play the flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric gloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head we could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end as time was running out in the advantage lindros found galley with a pass across the goal mouth but puppa made the save the rebound kicked back to the right corner where recchi picked it up passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle and eric one-timed past puppa at 7:55 with the assist recchi moves past bobby clarke 's 74-75 season the second best one season total for a flyer at eric moves up to 4th all time in flyers rookie scoring with points mike eastwood took down al conroy at 8:30 to give the flyers another chance on the power play not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19 not much happened on the on although the leafs had most of the possession the flyers smothered the leafs short power play tempers flared a little at 13:14 bowen and pearson got roughing minors keith acton got a bloody face dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a on the replay showed that hawgood's stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyers smothered the leafs power play led by dimitri yushkevich bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot he made all the flyers look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stoned him the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didn't get anything home shots were 13-10 flyers the flyers were content with the goal lead in the third period and they decided that if tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a little the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first or so minutes of the period but could n't get past puppa then the leafs got tired of lindros making road kill out of them and tempers flared each for doug gilmour and lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and each for glenn anderson and mcgill roughing all at 7:02 terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on gilmour again the flyers smothered the leafs power play at about the minute mark dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through soderstrom the puck was rolling on it 's side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other seconds later rod brind'amour tripped up gilmour at 12:24 to give the leafs another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom stoned andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01 no punches thrown recchi got the initial minor krushelnyski baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors at 17:02 rouse and beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got each for slashing to set up another on mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers zone as they were battling for the puck and while mcgill was down he ran his stick across mcgill 's face the flyers were not happy with that at all 5-8 al conroy paired up with 6-1 berehowski and started throwing punches upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and al got a standing o penalties eastwood cross check game clark carkner each berehowski and conroy each fighting at 17:49 so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers the had no interest in stting on the lead hawgood galley and brind'amour played catch until hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past puppa at 18:39 that was all the fireworks tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppa did but kept the flyers off the board 4-0 flyers shots were 9-8 flyers in the 3rd probably the strongest game i 've seen from the flyers since the all star break shutout number for soderstrom all since 1/10 tied for 2nd most in the nhl but he 's played fewer games than belfour or the goalie i can't remember that he 's tied with next up it 's the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyers can not be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end flyers up to points on the season in games last year they had points in games under .500 so they need at least points in their last games to improve on that only by percentage points under in is better than under in tragic number holds at points with games left the tragic number for 5th is points i watched the rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before i finished this up why points instead of well the flyers will win the tie-breaker if they catch them whereas the islanders win tie breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie the rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the devils the pens twice the flyers and finish up with games against the caps so i guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to

industrially silly processes on the moon as an excuse to put astronauts there ... fred replies translation it does n't support the nick szabo vision of the future to which you must subscribe ... tom sez fred we 're all supporting what each of us thinks should be done to some degree if you have a problem with what nick thinks should be done address it instead of just complaining about his doing so fred again you really do n't get what the 'complaints are about do you not incredibly clear explanation of complaints ... something between feelings regarding nick 's method and judgments about his meaning t maybe i 'd get it if you said what the complaints are about rather than doing the same things that you mean to complain about when you trash people how am i supposed to read that as 'trashing people is bad f gee funny that you get it now then deliberate obtuseness perhaps fred 's issue nick 's alleged trashing of others i only got it when you stopped trashing and made your point patently instead of 'allegorically that was my point all along fred not only do you do the same thing on the net honestly reporting your ideas on matters of policy and projects in space but your response was just baiting not even part of a debate i have yet to see nick enter into anything remotely resembling `` a debate '' i see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with the one true szabo plan i see him attacking people calling them `` lazy bastard '' because they had the temerity to disagree with the almight nick i see him questioning peoples ethics again because they had the temerity to disagree with lord god szabo but debate bwaaaaahhhaaaa i 'm glad you can laugh since your ratio of debate/insult is about the same not even close tommy and generally only when i 'm dealing with someone like nick i see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate suffice to say that i disagree with you on that last point why do n't you take a poll fred if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view and as usual you defend your insults with `` he started it '' `` yeah i took some of his research and called it my own but he started it '' `` so what if i stole his car he stole my lawnmower first '' besides that i think it 's still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it so your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool `` i never borrowed it i already gave it back and it was broken when you gave it to me '' make up yer mind fred i 'm not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space- based process and your response does n't tell me a thing about the reasons why you think they should be except to impune the motives of the person with a divergent opinion who said i think they should be tommy show me a note where i said that and i 'll eat this terminal see below fred fred i cocluded that you did since you took issue with it the fact that my conclusion was incorrect i.e that you were taking issue with something different is evidence that your communication style is confusing or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate first i try to address what i think you meant for which i am rewarded with a denial of sorts and a smart remark then i point out that i am not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly interpreting you a second time and i 'm stupid for it i just ca n't win can i fred you 've got a great point here somewhere it 's just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it please quote the 'it i took issue with i believe you will see if you look that what i was and am taking issue with is mr szabo 's idea that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his toaster-based infrastructure is finished all hail the szabo plan fred issue nick 's alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nick 's or you would have a really good point instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had my reading of what nick actually said is that `` people are n't required in all parts of all space processes '' so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program i read as `` people are required in all parts of all space processes '' so help me out here fred since i'm so patently stupid did you read nick wrong or are you going to eat your terminal now if the latter i sure hope it 's one of those cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about the point is _i_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption i'd only be stupid if i insulted you for having made it but alas that 's your job fred and finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points simultaneously with an allegory/insult sadly one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone more deliberate lack of understanding tommy no no i finally got it you do n't like the plan that nick 's posts made you imagine and you do n't like nick 's obnoxious behavior even though it 's no worse than your own thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself if you have a problem with nick 's delivery address that the way you bait you 're perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of no tommy the 'bait is that which elicits the response nick 'baits i just flame him for being an obnoxious fool i do n't really care who started it i read this list to get information and other 's views on the issues to which it was dedicated not to be your mom he started it no he did or to hear about why nick is a very bad guy if you think flaming is bad stop flaming or at least get to the point in the first post instead of explaining yourself all the time that 's nice tommy when you pay me to post to the net you can complain about not getting your money 's worth perhaps if you weren't deliberately too thick to get the point the first time i wouldn't have to waste time `` explaining myself all the time '' of course socrates how could it be otherwise i think it 's neat how all this criticism from you started after your 'fatherly admonitions to me about how such things should be handled outside usenet were somewhat rebuffed being a little hypocritical tommy to go with the immaturity or is this just the pique of a net.ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he thought was new and hence could be 'instructed -- tommy i saw you come on the net who cares who came on the net first if you do consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus before which i was on for about years if you had seen me on the net first you 'd remember when nick and i went down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior it's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own let 's see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers is n't and my complaints about your name-calling are immature while your name-calling is n't yeah right maybe if you called me some more names i might see it better fred `` net.ghod wannabe '' naturally fred you 've correctly interpreted my motivations when yours are impossible to judge from your actions as your insulting of people that try proves i did n't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what i really wanted was to impress everyone i only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail not because it belongs there but because i thought you were such a jerk that you 'd bring it back to the net playing right into my hands alas i had no idea what an intellectual master you were turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me whether i should feel stupid because i tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect or becuase i tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass still is n't clear well fred you exposed me now i 'll never be able to get a nother job with nasa since they all know that i 'm stupider than fred mccall well i just hope you 're happy please leave me alone now i just don't have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above

about giving money to russia it makes me proud to be a libertarian it appears both conservatives and liberals prefer to cold war until you win then nurse the enemy back to health for another go around enemy sounds like that 's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked conservative -- 'always been commies always will be ok i should have said `` former '' enemy i was being sarcastic about what interventionists want to do i suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti-west slogans coming from his opponents in the russian congress i sure know who i want to back could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a gun have you considered a non-interventionist policy if market reform does happen russia will certainly get private capital at private risk to help their economy they will even have incentive to do so for the same reason if they do n't reform then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them then their 's the ideological point we want to `` win '' russia over to our type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit over everyone 's finances it 's like subsidizing the wealthy countries japan germany etc with free defense and then trade-warring with them because of the economic competition it 's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke better to let them degenerate into civil war remember all those nuclear weapons in russia i can not imagine that they would not be used in a civil war if nationialists take over and even if they prevent a civil war most feel they must take back large parts of land that are in other countries like ukraine i also can not imagine ukraine giving up land without a fight possibly nuclear how does this affect us well we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of europe are blown away i think we 'd feel something a massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is bound to have affects here of course there is also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies or struggling democracies if a 1.6 billion gift was that important to our well being could n't it be raised voluntarilly people already give over billion a year to charity i ask myself what law could we pass to prevent government from doing stupid frivilous things with our money then i think the constitution was supposed to do that could someone please tell me what legitimate constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries seriously seriously everyone has different opinions on what is stupid my two `` causes '' are aid to russia and a strong space program someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish that is why we have a republic and not a true democracy instead of gridlock on a massive scale we only have gridlock on a congressional scale it seems instead of gridlock on any scale we have aid to russia expensive space programs national charity that does n't help the poor and probably studies of drunken goldfish i think limited government is more key than how democratic it is btw who is to decide 'stupid this is just like those who want to impose their 'morals on others -- just the sort of thing i thought libertarians were against that was an opinion and libertarians are very big on free speech actually my politics are pretty libertarian except on this one issue and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party it seems that libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim if you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should be very libertarian consider it a compromise how much money would your fellow russia-aiders have to give to russia if those you oppose were n't using the same government machine to steal money from you and your group for causes you do n't support we could do that years ago but not now people have been saying that for hundreds of years like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and global decision making all the more reason to depend on the free market which can more efficiently process information than to depend on rulers for decisions on complex issues
