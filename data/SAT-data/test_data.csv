1," ingles engin.umich.edu ray ingles subject re concerning god 's morality was americans and evolution in article 1993apr2.155057.808 batman.bmd.trw.com jbrown batman.bmd.trw.com writes why do babies get diseases etc what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism here 's the main problem the scenario you outline is reasonably consistent but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only does not support it but indicates something far different the earth by latest estimates is about 4.6 billion years old and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years humans have only been around for at most about 200,000 years but the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving and in fact disease-ridden long before there were people yes there are fossils that show signs of disease ... mostly bone disorders of course but there are some heck not just fossil evidence but what we 've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long long time if human sin was what brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before humans god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw and without getting sidetracked into the theological ramifications of the original sin the main effect of the so-called original sin for this discussion was to remove humanity from god 's protection since by their choice a e cut themselves off from intimate fellowship with god in addition their sin caused them to come under the dominion of satan who then assumed dominion over the earth ... deletions since humanity was no longer under god 's protection but under satan's dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterial/viral and genetic although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this uh ... i know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this there is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other 'started off' in perfect condition it seems to adapt to its envionment in a collective sense i 'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code human dna being more `` complex '' tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is a bad combination umm nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria and they to us only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans ... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size but the ranks keep changing for example bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease i 'm sure you 'll agree but it still pops up from time to time even today ... and does n't do as much damage part of that is because of better sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed forgive the poor terminology i 'm an engineer not a doctor and died off for lack of nearby hosts i could be wrong on this but from what i gather acne is only a few hundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer it seems to be getting less nasty w/age ... hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases/disorders now wait a minute i have a question humans were created perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it seems unlikely that satan who 's making the diseases would also gift humans with the means to fight them off simpler to make the diseases less lethal if he wants survivors as far as i can see our immune systems imperfect though they may presently be must have been built into us by god i want to be clear on this are you saying that god was planning ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not at the time of design necessary that is god made our immune systems ahead of time knowing that adam and eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases this may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you are prepared to accept but god is not responsible for disease even if satan had nothing to do with the original inception of disease evolution by random chance would have produced them since humanity forsook god 's protection here 's another puzzle what exactly do you mean by 'perfect in the phrase 'created ... perfect and without flaw to my mind a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time a 'perfect system that will without constant intervention become imperfect is not a perfect system at least imho or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with elmer 's glue that is the original genetic 'instructions were perfect but were 'written in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart if so why could god not have used better materials was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself of did it just choose not to deletions in summary newborns are innocent but god does not cause their suffering my main point as i said was that there really is n't any evidence for the explanation you give at least that i 'm aware of but i couldn't help making a few nitpicks here and there sincerely ray ingles || the above opinions are probably || not those of the university of ingles engin.umich.edu || michigan yet"

1, ednclark kraken.itc.gu.edu.au jeffrey clark subject re a little too satanic mangoe cs.umd.edu charley wingate writes nanci ann miller writes my favorite reply to the `` you are being too literal-minded '' complaint is that if the bible is really inspired by god and if it is really that important to him then he would make damn certain all the translators and scribes and people interpreting and copying it were getting it right literally if not then why should i put any merit at all in something that has been corrupted over and over and over by man even if it was originally inspired by god the `` corrupted over and over '' theory is pretty weak comparison of the current hebrew text with old versions and translations shows that the text has in fact changed very little over a space of some two millennia this should n't be all that suprising people who believe in a text in this manner are likely to makes some pains to make good copies -- do you honestly hold to that tripe charley for a start there are enough current versions of the bible to make comparisons to show that what you write above is utter garbage witness jw mormon catholic anglican and greek orthodox bibles but to really convince you i 'd have to take you to a good old library in our local library we had a king james which i compared to a brand new hot of god 's tongue good news bible genesis was almost unrecognisable many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been edited from the good news bible in fact the god of good news was a much more congenial fellow i must say if you like i 'll get the king james out again and actually give you some quotes at least the headings have n't changed much jeff

hunt here is his posting in article 8feu_ko00xsf0kpc5p andrew.cmu.edu david o hunt bluelobster+ cmu.edu writes i 'm pretty sure i 've seen biblical rules for when it 's allowable to rape prisoners what the codes are about that etc could some more knowledgable soul than i please let me know some references he asked a very narrow question and i gave a very narrow answer yes sorry i have got that wrong my apology deletion no david hunt 's post did n't mention a god nor did my response you were the first to bring up the idea of the bible being `` given by god '' most jews do n't believe this in any literal sense so no fun but i must have met the minority then and `` given by god '' refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something rob i am not intimate with jewish theology but i understand that you are a messianic jew correct me if i am wrong but it appears that the views of messianic jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of jews while jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the christianic god views i have heard that it is possible for jews to attribute evil to their god an no-no for christians the bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man deletion no i thought we agreed that though jews disagree there are a set of core beliefs that they do agree upon one of which is that the commandments are accessible and written in the language of the time and another of which is that there must be a legal system to update them the context was metaphysics even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion i wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system deletion could you explain this with respect to the original commandments being discussed -- that is the commandment that says if you feel like raping a woman prisoner you should instead wait and marry her what about `` the way this commandment is given '' invalidates it is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds the context is repulsive and it is foul play imo to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book big deletion the point is that i see that there is a necessary connection between the theology you use and the interpretation of the bible only very loosely my interpretation of the bible is based on a long tradition of jewish scholars interpreting the bible theology does n't really enter into it -- there are jewish atheists who interpret the laws of charity essentially the same way i do no not the interpretation of some laws but the interpretation of the bible as in the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue with god the whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god whatever that means that alone is a theo- logic question is proof of a theology used you pose another metaphysical riddle no you do well you wrote this fine so we have some major spirit with neither absolute power nor absolute knowledge and as it appears limited means or will to communicate with us some form of spiritual big friend do you admit that using god in this context is somewhat unusual am i right in the assumption that it can not have created the universe as well and that the passages in the bible referring to that or its omnipotence are crap that 's what i meant by the `` riddle '' it is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh sodom and gomorrha means either there is some connection between the text the fact that it exists and your interpretation of it or it is purely arbitrary .. further the question is why is has one to carry the burden of biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better you might answer that one ca n't becuase some peculiar biblical information might be lost but that holds true of every other book and the question remains why has the bible still a special place ca n't it be replaced somehow is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the bible against some other message that is included as well deletion do you see the danger in doing so especially with the metaphers used in the bible i think the danger of doing so is less than either the danger of having a frozen system of laws or having no laws sorry but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system deletion if we read two stories about the importance of helping the poor and in one god is a spirit and in the other god has a body which is more important helping the poor or resolving the contradiction about the corporeal nature of god if we read two stories in the bible one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly what is more important to resolve the message that children are to be killed or if it has to be done by god and the argument you have given is a fallacy while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not it can be crucial in other questions religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god one can not resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what is good depends on the question benedikt

leland.stanford.edu galahad leland.stanford.edu scott compton writes jim you originally wrote ... god did not create disease nor is he responsible for the maladies of newborns what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~ do you have any evidence for this if the code was once perfect and has degraded ever since we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement should n't we perhaps the biggest `` imperfection '' of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions introns which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions exons an impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains is the number of introns decreasing or increasing it appears that intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes on the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted later presents several logical difficulties introns are removed by a splicing mechanism this would have to be present but unused if introns are inserted moreover intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting random insertion would not be tolerated since sequences for intron removal self-splicing of mrna are conserved besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace long terminal repeats and target site duplications and these are not found in or near intron sequences i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting `` theological arguments '' like this try watson 's molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish baltimore 's molecular biology of the cell for starters remember the question was posed in a theological context why does god cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective -- my own it is no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion i think you misread my meaning i said god made the genetic code perfect but that does n't mean it 's perfect now it has certainly evolved since for the worse would you please cite a few references that support your assertion your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence in fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we 've thought for instance sex might have evolved as defence against parasites this view is supported by computer simulations of evolution eg tierra perhaps i thought it was higher energy rays like x-rays gamma rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage in fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action actually neither of us `` knows '' what the atmosphere was like at the time when god created life according to my recollection most biologists do not claim that life began billion years ago -- after all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth was created it would still be too primitive to support life i seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to billion years ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with a better estimate i 'd replace `` created '' with `` formed '' since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one most recent estimates of the age of the earth range between 4.6 4.8 billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but organic stromatolite-like layers date back to 3.5 billion years this would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve i 'm sorry i ca n't give any references this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i attended here dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterial/viral and genetic although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this again do you _want_ this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed `` degeneration '' i can understand scott 's reaction excuse me but this is so far-fetched that i know you must be jesting do you know what pathogens are do you know what point mutations are do you know that everything can come about spontaneously in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you can not know that i hope you do n't forget this we have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against this conclusion in science one does not have to _believe_ in anything it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one 's own conclusions prior to this theology does not use this method therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions human dna being more `` complex '' tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is a bad combination hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases/disorders you are supposing a purpose not a valid move bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease they are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution only replication saves replicators from degradiation we are just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate the less efficient methods did n't make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for your claim that human dna is degrading through evolutionary processes some people have claimed that the opposite is true we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade i have n't seen much evidence for either claim but then i ask so where is this relevant to my discussion in answering john 's question of why why are there genetic diseases and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require babies to develop antibodies is it god 's fault the original question -- i say no it is not of course nothing `` evil '' is god 's fault but your explanation does not work it fails miserably you may be right but the fact is that you do n't know that satan is not responsible and neither do i. suppose that a powerful evil being like satan exists would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills that affect mankind i do n't think so he could have done a much better job pun intended the problem is it seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution did i say that where seems to me like another bad inference actually what you 've done is to oversimplify what i said to the point that your summary of my words takes on a new context i never said that people are `` meant '' presumably by god `` to be punished by getting diseases '' why i did say is that free moral choices have attendent consequences if mankind chooses to reject god as people have done since the beginning then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic universe i am not expecting this if god exists i expect him to leave us alone i would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free this is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be what consequences would you expect from rejecting allah oh i admit it 's not perfect yet but i 'm working on it a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point what does this have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provided an answer biology and genetics are fine subjects and important scientific endeavors but they explain how god created and set up life processes they do n't explain the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution why is there a `` why behind '' and your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence this is why we recommend these books is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological theories hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this thanks scotty for your fine and sagely advice but i am not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details of biology and genetics although i 'm sure i 'd find it a fascinating subject for i realize that the details do not change the big picture that god created life in the beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its environment i 'm sorry but they do there is no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation it can

1, keith cco.caltech.edu keith allan schneider subject re pompous ass mvs104 psuvm.psu.edu writes many people would probably think especially if the fanatics propogandized this that this was a conflict between the atheists and the religious many would get the impression that we were trying to outlaw religion if we contintue to try to remove all things with a religious reference that 's not what the people i 've asked think perhaps you would be right if you said the fundamentalists would think this way after all they think they are being oppressed when they are not allowed to oppress however you have not shown where you get this idea that 'many people would 'probably think it 's atheism vs. religion winner take all as far as i can tell it is your groundless prediction that this will happen but you have n't taken into the account of propoganda remember if you asked germans before wwii if the jews shoudl be slaughtered they would probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at least some were able to tolerate it you see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy the propoganda machines have been in gear over a number of issues including abortion and gays ... look at some of the things that have happened well so far they have passed one amendment which is currently under intense scrutiny and they have failed to outlaw abortion which is their prime goal on that issue yep they seem sooo effective sure well they have n't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts but they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion they could create similar problems for us and it could be worse they can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics etc. but imagine what they 'd have to do to stop atheism besides the margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people better than your one that is your opinion also i have branched out and the informal survey is up over half a dozen now and what have they said were you questions unbiased keith you would claim that my questions are biased the minute i posted them because the answers agreed with me everyone i have asked about the possible removal of the motto the christian portion has expressed regret about its loss because they like it however when it is pointed out to them that a new motto will not be in the works none have expressed the desire to rape murder pillage etc. which you have basically claimed so you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of them a whole nation as for the atheist portion i know some around here they have all expressed disgust with the motto some noted being harassed by christians who used the motto to try to seem justified and all would see it gone yes i 'd be glad if it were gone to i 've never supported it however i think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted with what could happen an what may be likely which christians designed the motto does the motto say anything about jesus why do you think that it refers only to christians christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and all others are wrong therefore why would they 'include other religions in the realm of being correct i doubt that any other religions were meant to be included well i am not clear on the religious convictions of francis scott key the motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed in a god and surely there are a few christians that think as you say but i do n't think that most do do you think that all christians actively despise other religions most that i have met have n't and do n't do so no christian that i have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them why not ask some people of other faiths sorry i would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here suppose you could ask a few people well i have asked a hindu moselem and a few jews and all of them think that it is applicable to them of course i ca n't say that these people just some that i know pretty well are accurate representations of their faiths it is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting views on any given issue you are assuming that all the views were the same and nothing leads to this conclusion without evidence to the contrary i doubt that there were dissenting opinions you claim there were provide some evidence for your assertion well i 'd really like to and i 've tried but i really do n't know where to get access to _congressional records_ from the 's can anyone help out here comparing christians to nazis interesting only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs no again the motto on the money does n't cost you anything extra however if you abolished the motto we 'd all have to pay to have all the dies and plates redone like people paid before to get them changed to have the motto on them you now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again ... also i doubt that they use th3 same plates for more than a year 's printing this would make it easy to remove the motto simply make next year 's plates without it your claim evidently is that they will have to pay extra somewhere provide some evidence for this assertion so are you saying that they redesign the plates each year anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted i see was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money this is just not correct the ones i read did n't mention anything about jesus i think the issue was concerning the distinction between religion and not how could it be between religious and not religious the motto refers to god it is a religious motto the question is whether or not it is only christian you say it is more i doubt this provide some evidence for this assertion that is to say the religion of this country and the non-religion of the ussr that was what most of those quotes were about and some included all atheists in general as well i do n't think that any of the quotes although i seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about jesus they advocated religion over non-religion a specific religion was not mentioned you have missed this point i said that the motto did n't say anything about anyone in particular that is the motto does n't imply anything about your particular beliefs it does n't say that everyone trusts in some form of god only that the nation on the whole does we have been through this before it 's obvious it does not include me this much is beyond doubt your claim again is that the motto refers to more than christians based on the facts that christianity says all other religions are wrong and because it seems that the motto was written by christians i doubt your claim so you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong that 's silly i think the flat-earthers are wrong but i do n't advocate their banishment ... based on this idea i doubt that any additional expense would even be incurred by removing the motto provide some evidence for your claim that it would i think that any such cost would be insignificant i mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency disregarding the digression of the other motto ... if it is used for harassment and no other purpose has been found for it why should it not be removed well mottos in general do n't really have purposes ... i do n't think it should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences and do you know what the vote was were there other opinions do you think that the main reason the motto was required by law was to bother atheists do you think that this is what the majority of congress at the time had in mind if you do then show why again it is the opinion of the people who put it there that i am concerned with then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress again it is not necessary that the complete majority shared the purpose of confronting 'godless communism with this motto why not it is the majority that put it there the general public probably does not know about the anti-atheist intent of a few people in the 's either i daresay more people remember the 's than the time when key wrote the anthem but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists why don't you include this in your little survey that you were conducting ... you claim here that scientists would believe someone 's claims i doubt this provide evidence for your assertion what should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein said about relativity is worthy i mean if einstein said it there 's a good chance that it was right at least at the time as for the courts the method scientists use can be applied i need not agree with the court by default because of a 'good record you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point what but you said you did n't agree with the court because they `` allowed congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning '' if you do n't realize that something like this is external to the realm of the court 's power then how can i be confident that you know anything about the court 's powers i mean if you do n't know how the court works how can you participate in a discussion of the court a judge can go to speak before congress and still you ignore the abortion gag rule as you make your claims on abortion no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a constitutional amendment and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be presented mushrooms flowers trees buildings signs whatever ... the analogy is the same just because something that i might find offensive is present does n't mean that my rights are being violated we are talking about something put there by people keith ... not a mushroom no one caused that mushroom to exist unless you're finding things offensive in a mushroom farm yes some mushrooms can be planted and i do n't appreciate mushrooms on my pizza either this is not the case with the motto and you 're ignoring the harassment which is the only known result of the motto and you 're ignoring that somewhere along the line people were forced to put the motto there who was forced to put the motto there what do you mean keith

2, robert cpuserver.acsc.com robert grant subject virtual reality for x on the cheap hi everyone i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups announcing the release of multiverse-1.0.2 multiverse is a multi-user non-immersive x-windows based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainment/research features client-server based model using berkeley sockets no limit to the number of users apart from performance generic clients customizable servers hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources multiple light sources ambient point and spot objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attached functionality client the client is built around a 'fast render loop basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the user's actions which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users the client is designed to be generic in other words you do n't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it the adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers this release of the client software supports the following functionality o hierarchical objects with associated addressing o multiple light sources and types ambient point and spot o user interface panels o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rates o mouse and keyboard input some people may be disappointed that this software does n't support the powerglove as an input device this is not because it ca n't but because i do n't have one this will however be one of the first enhancements server s this is where customization can take place the following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers o transparent client management o client message handling this may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects o server selectable extension installation what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialisers you want o event handler registration when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to current events supported init move change collide terminate o collision detection registration if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activated when a collision occurs this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose the following is all you need to make a world server application o provide an initworld function this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function this is where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobjects function this is where you load the world .wld file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function this is where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the objects move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrunning the clients that 's all there is to it and to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers i 've provided generic lines dactyl lines more complicated collision detection due to the stairs will probably be improved with future versions dogfight lines location this software is located at the following site ftp.u.washington.edu directory pub/virtual-worlds file multiverse-1.0.2.tar.z futures client o texture mapping o more realistic rendering i.e z-buffering or similar gouraud shading o hmd support o etc etc .... server o physical modelling gravity friction etc o enhanced object management/interaction o etc etc .... both o improved comms i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and i 'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe i 've certainly found fascinating developing it and i would love to add support for the powerglove ... and an hmd finally one major disclaimer this is totally amateur code by that i mean there is no support for this code other than what i out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide i can not be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code use it at your own risk disclaimer over of course if you love it i would like to

2, mogal deadhead.asd.sgi.com joshua mogal subject re hollywood hits virtual reality sorry i missed you raymond i was just out in dahlgren last month ... i 'm the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics so perhaps i can help a little in article 1993mar17.185725.13487 relay.nswc.navy.mil rchui nswc-wo.nswc.navy.mil raymond chui writes hello the real reality our agency started to express interest in virtual reality vr so far we do not know much about vr all we know about are the hollywood movies `` the terminater '' and `` lawnmover man '' we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and computer graphics world magazine unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects for both terminator and lawnmower man those are film-quality computer graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time frames per second we certainly want to know more about vr who are the leading companies agencies universities what machines support vr i.e sgi sun4 hp-9000 bim-6000 etc. it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from to newly rendered frames per second this is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations additionally the frame rate must be constant if the system renders frames per second at one point then frames per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in real-time unix in general does not support real-time operation but silicon graphics has modified the unix kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation bypassing the usual unix process priority-management schemes uniprocessor systems running unix can not fundamentally support real-time operation not sun sparc10 not hp series systems not ibm rs-6000 not even sgi 's uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support real-time operation due to their symmetric multi-processing smp shared-memory architecture a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine2 systems fully support these capabilities the anti-aliasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment what kind of graphics languages are used with vr gl opengl phigs pex gks etc. you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop vr applications but that is starting at a pretty low level there are

2, deb charisma.graphics.cornell.edu in recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called postscript see `` postscript language '' by adobe systems incorporated isbn 0-201-10179-3 co. so given a line l and a polygon p we can write a postscript program that draws the line l and the polygon p and then `` outputs '' the answer by `` output '' we mean the program executes a command called `` showpage '' which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon a quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q and thus the original problem curiously in modern postscript the point in a polygon problem can be solved even more easily to wit title point in polygon creator allen b ab cc.purdue.edu for the amusement of regulars languagelevel documentneededresource humor sense thereof endcomments this program will test whether a point is inside a given polygon currently it uses the even-odd rule but that can be changed by replacing ineofill with infill these are level operators so if you 've only got level you 're out of luck the result will be printed on the output stream caution only accurate to device pixels put a huge scale in first if you are n't sure point to test put x and y coordinates here vertices of polygon in counter-clockwise order put array of pairs of coordinates here dup get aload pop moveto dup length dup roll sub getinterval aload pop lineto forall closepath ineofill yes no ifelse

2, mogal deadhead.asd.sgi.com joshua mogal subject re sgi sales practices was crimson was kubota announcement my comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive 3d graphics applications it is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team feel free to contact the local branch manager ... we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot i 'm also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while rather than being flushed as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in and grew to include the 4d/20 4d/25 4d/30 and 4d/35 as clock rates sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about 4-5 years this was true of the motorola-based series '85-'89 the pi '88-'93 the professional series the early 4d 's '86-'90 the power series parallel systems '88-'93 individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about years new graphics architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every months to years these are the facts of life if we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and i/o and larger disk capacities if we do n't we become uncompetitive the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today you ca n't wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep for one in writing if it 's feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the performance protection program for older r3000-based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter but i 'm just a little tired of getting boned in the process if that 's happening it 's becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base maybe it 's because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we are n't entitled to a `` peek under the covers '' as the big kids nasa for instance are this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations does n't have a load of money to spend on computers every year so we ca n't be out buying new systems on a regular basis most sgi customers are onesy-twosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one previous poster 's words 'to fill a niche to compete with some other vendor i 'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years and every time i look at it i 'm going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money since we're supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years making a year old computer at least and probably generations behind the times the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so do n't give up we know it josh -- joshua mogal product manager advanced graphics

3, document_id from glazer ohstpy.mps.ohio-state.edu subject local windows .vs shared windows discussion i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a novell administrator 's point of view i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they microsoft has decided to implement as a standard for software support the local setup described below as the `` most advantageous installation '' if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then i will comply but i 'd like to hear it from administrators first the local windows installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive assuming the resources are available from a network administrator 's implementation he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using setup/a then install windows on a per/machine bases by running setup off the network to install the complete system on the local drives in this way all drivers are available to the setup procedure w/o the need to change disks advantages reduce traffic running windows locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main windows files network independence if the network fails and they all do at one point or another the local installation would allow users to keep producing and reduce the cost of down-time faster windows theoretically windows will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network this may be a hard point to prove if the network has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster access than local ones a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about varying setups monochrome color types of mouse etc ... since the windows installation is assigned to the workstation disadvantages cost installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk space workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from to percent administration local windows installations are very difficult to administer new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available each of which would have to be individually installed on each workstation security users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system files from simple ignorance this could result in quite a headache for administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations backup we all know the problems backing up local hard disks the backup sets if done via a centralized tape system get very large very quickly backup individually to floppy may not happen at all this may be eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable applications and not user data the shared windows installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setup/a procedure described above users or administrators then install a minimal set of files to individual `` user '' directories these directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network `` home '' directory the bulk of the windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory some 400+ files and are accessed shared as-needed by users throughout their windows session the user 's files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during his/her windows session these include group files .ini files and other regularly updated files advantages a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy as an updated driver becomes available it only needs to be installed in this single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it assuming that the users files are maintained in network home directories the administrator can easily edit any .ini file as-needed to correct problems that may arise this includes win.ini and system.ini backup of all pertinent files is done easily even if the users files are on a local hard disk the bulk of the windows system is backed up with all driver updates disadvantages network traffic since all windows files are being shared in a network directory traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of windows if the network crashes all production comes to a stop since window's is reliant upon the network for its files loss of data usually occurs as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work although minimal disk space is still a consideration if the users files are maintained on the network a large number of users can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows files alone users can not easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware are similar this is due to the windows installation being tied to a particular username in the case of network user files the discussion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ i would like to know from other administrators with a large windows userbase how they prefer setting up windows personally i have setup numerous installations using the shared setup all windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks in fact i sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money i would also like to see recommendations for applications should apps such as word and/or excel be installed locally regardless of how windows is installed again i keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is `` putting all eggs in one basket '' if the network crashes work comes to a halt now i am sure microsoft and i know your out there has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to hear from people with `` actual '' working experience with users and network administration

4, document_id from wlsmith valve.heart.rri.uwo.ca wayne smith subject re ide vs scsi in article 1qk7kvinnndk dns1.nmsu.edu bgrubb dante.nmsu.edu grubb writes point of view why does scsi have an advantage when it comes to multi- tasking data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster does it have a better cache system i thought scsi was good at managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached if we are only talking about a single drive explain why scsi is inherently faster at managing data from a hard drive ide integrated device electronics currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer ~5mb/s max why do n't you start with the spec-sheet of the isa bus first you can quote scsi specs till you 're blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bus capability then what 's the point who says ide is limited to megs/sec what about vlb-ide does anyone know how they perform so at its lowest setting scsi-2 interface in asynchronous scsi-1 mode averages the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode in full scsi-2 mode it blows poor ide out the window down the street and into the garbage can as implimented on what system the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and that is where the bottleneck and cost of scsi-2 comes from not the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the scsi-2 through put given the original question scsi used only as a single hard drive controller is it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least maybe megs/sec for the scsi choice to make any sence what does a 200-400 meg megs/sec scsi drive cost the cost of scsi interface is a self fulliling prophisy few people buy scsi because it is so expencive for the pc which in turn convices makes that mass producing scsi which would reduce its cost is unwarented and so scsi is expencive that is the effect of the rule of scale the more items sold the less each item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost the original cga cart back in '84 was i think the original ega card or pga was scsi has stood relatively alone in not coming down in price mainly because we 're talking about pc 's and not sun 's or sparc or sgi or name your favorite unix workstation that is after millions of pc buying decisions over the years scsi has had plenty of time to come down in price i wo n't argue that the scsi standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bus when it comes to multi-tasking os 's when managing data from a single scsi hard drive

comp.os.os2.multimedia and comp.os.os2.bugs this document contains the background showing the need for these proposals the proposed charters for these proposals voting instructions a voting ballot some example ballots the voting rules the voting schedule the mass acknowledgement background the creation of two free 32-bit compilers for os/2 2.x gcc/2 and emx/gcc read comp.os.os2.programmer for details has spurred a continuing deluge of software ported from unix platforms such as emacs less awk grep sed xscheme ispell flex yacc and much more borland has released its c/c++ compiler for os/2 2.x allowing for easier porting of dos and windows software much of the pc hardware and drivers were written for dos and later windows as more people are discovering os/2 2.x the number of people asking questions about os/2 's compatibility with their hardware increases as does the questions on the availability of drivers for their hardware installation procedures etc multimedia is becoming popular os/2 2.0 supports windows multimedia extensions using win-os/2 3.0 furthermore ibm is including direct multimedia support in os/2 starting with version 2.1 in addition to using win-os/2 3.1 any non-trivial software will have bugs -- os/2 is not exempt especially since ibm is constantly adding new features to os/2 so far ibm has issued system patches and corrective service disks e.g the service pak for free free from bbss and ftp sites or for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read comp.os.os2.misc for details proposed charters a create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting unmoderated it will provide a forum for developers of ported software so as to coordinate efforts avoid duplication of effort and spur additional development the group will also cover topics such as porting from other platforms such as dos windows unix etc toolkits which aid in program portability including porting tools such as mirrors and so forth b rename comp.os.os2.programmer.misc unmoderated to keep the structure of the os/2 newsgroup heirarchy orthogonal comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to comp.os.os2.programmer.misc comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup for os/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and technical aspects of os/2 in an unmoderated setting c create comp.os.os2.setup unmoderated it will be devoted to os/2 system setup topics including the availability of device drivers compatibility information installation procedures system requirements and overall performance optimization d create comp.os.os2.multimedia unmoderated it will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues e create comp.os.os2.bugs unmoderated it will provide a forum for os/2 system bug reports bug diagnosis and work arounds the availability of system patches and corrective service disks and so forth note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other newsgroups and discussion of bugs in os/2 betas belong in

despite its small size and quickness it has enough power to satisfy most users including standard x-y plots semilog plots log-log plots contour plots 3d plots mesh plots bar charts and pie charts multiple graphs of the same or different sizes may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph different line styles widths and colors are supported a virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used there are almost characters in the extended character set this includes four different fonts the greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and other symbols the fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects many different output device drivers are available system dependent including a portable metafile format and renderer the plplot package is freely distributable but not in the public domain the plplot source code except header files and those files explicitly granting permission may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors you are allowed and encouraged to include the plplot object library and header files in a commercial package provided that it is explicitly and prominently stated that the plplot library is freely available and the full copyrights on the plplot package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package we welcome suggestions on how to improve this code especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes if plplot is used in any published papers please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work which will help us to continue improving plplot also please remember that as plplot is not a commercial product we can not be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may there is great interest in extending plplot and fixing bugs but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done plplot is written in c enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification fortran programs may use it transparently stub routines are provided to handle the c fortran interface without any modification of the user program c programs are required to include the header file `` plplot.h '' see the documentation for more details the main documentation for plplot is in the doc/ directory in the form of several tex files please consult this for additional information 'latex plotdoc unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code so do n't be surprised if some known features are not

with lots of different features and abilities the choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features at this point most respondents have agreed upon `` twm '' as the best candidate for a speedy window manager a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like `` zooming '' and `` opaque move '' also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows joe english joe trystero.art.com i 've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 aka -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal -- 13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 it is the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun 1152x900 screen and still get two column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap other font suggestions will be accepted -- -- -- -- -- -- the x server -- -- -- -- -- -- which server make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x11 server on my monochrome sun i have n't noticed much difference between the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it was pointed out to me that xsunmono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging thanks to jonny farringdon j.farringdon psychol.ucl.ac.uk michael salmon michael.salmon eos.ericsson.se how your server was compiled can also make a difference jeff law law schirf.cs.utah.edu advises us that on a sun system x should be compiled with gcc version or with the unbundled sun compiler you can expect to get `` very large speedups in the server '' by not using the bundled sunos compiler i assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market locking the server into ram has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and does not get paged eg via a call to plock does this help performance at all i 've had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone who 's tried it i am not in a position to give it a try thanks to eric c claeys ecc eperm.att.com danny backx db sunbim.be juan d. martin juando cnm.us.es starting your server joe english joe trystero.art.com if you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one after i changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time ... we have a heavily loaded system without much core though this sounds crazy but i have confirmed that it works warner losh imp solbourne.com provided me with a good explanation of why this works which i have summarized here when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections a lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts this process touches a large number of pages any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory if you put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and `` databases '' and so forth all this activity is typically memory intensive once this initialization is done `` the process has reached a steady state '' the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .xinitrc you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation 's limited resources this is most definitely a `` your mileage may vary '' situation as there are so many variables to be considered available ram local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc currently in my .xinitrc i have a situation like sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i 've experimented with sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i 've even tried sleep exec start_x_clients_script and then in start_x_clients_script i had sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a `` steady state '' before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched all of these yielded fairly comparable results and so i just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity you will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you fonts loading fonts takes time and ram if you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you 'll get speed increases in load-up time one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server this will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server farrell mckay fbm ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au joe english joe trystero.art.com eg my main xterm font is 7x13 so i also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it 's menus and icons etc twm 's default font is 8x13 since i do n't normally use 8x13 i 've eliminated one font from my server oliver jones oj roadrunner.pictel.com keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs if you will make extensive use of r5 scalable fonts use a font server about the resources file keep your .xresources .xdefaults file small saves ram and saves on server startup time joe english joe trystero.art.com one suggestion in your .xdefaults .xresources file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications for example reversevideo true then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files for example home/lib/app-defaults in your .login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath home/lib/app-defaults/ n the `` frequently asked questions '' faq contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work -- ed so when xterm launches it loads its resources from ... /app-defaults/xterm xdvi finds them in ... /app-defaults/xdvi and so on and so forth note that not all clients follow the same xxxxx resource-file naming pattern you can check in your system app-defaults directory often /usr/x11r5/lib/x11/app-defaults/ to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name this is all documented in the xt specification pg thanks to kevin samborn samborn mtkgc.com michael urban urban cobra.jpl.nasa.gov and mike long mikel ee.cornell.edu kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers this method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits easier to maintain more usable fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resource_manager property as a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn t have to load all your resources applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them it also has drawbacks the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up this does n't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability if you are modifying an application 's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to `` xrdb '' again xrdb will by default run your .xdefaults file through cpp when your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not watch out for this i had c style comments in my .xdefaults file which cpp stripped out when i switched to this method of distributed resource files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources xt did not provide any error message when it encountered the c style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy e.g `` ifdef color '' ... is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management you may also run into some clients which break the rules for example neither emacs 18.58.3 nor xvt 1.0 will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .xdefaults when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources casey leedom casey gauss.llnl.gov a possible compromise suggestion that i have and am planning on trying is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my .xdefaults file and to use the `` separate resources files '' method for clients that i seldom use define your display properly client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server in that situation rather than setting your display environment variable to `` hostname :0.0 '' where hostname is the name of your workstation you should set your display variable to `` unix:0.0 '' or `` :0.0 '' by doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests thanks to patrick j horgan pjh70 ras.amdahl.com see the _display names_ section of the x man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name `` i do n't think it 's stock mit but at least data general and hp

a few megabytes of ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running for example is there a smaller clock program than xclock unfortunately i have n't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients eg xclock xterm xbiff are welcome -- ed i 've received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of x client programs some advocate the use of programs that are strictly xlib based since xt xaw and other toolkits are rather large others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries in this case using a non-xt for example client program may actually _increase_ the amount of ram consumed the upshot of all this seems to be do n't mix toolkits that is try and use just athena clients or just xview clients or just motif clients etc if you use more than one then you 're dragging in more than one toolkit library know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment thanks to rob sartin 88opensi sartin uunet.uu.net duncan sinclair sinclair dcs.gla.ac.uk sinclair uk.ac.gla.dcs a better clock for x xcuckoo suggested by duncan

export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.z `` ... if you do n't need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt ... it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog `` this was written as a partial 'clone of xterm you do n't have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be xterm in it 's current version you can not bind keys as you can in xterm i 've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but i 've not found any yet update march i recently had a few email conversations with brian warkentin brian.warkentine eng.sun.com regarding xvt he questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm for instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed try this quickie benchmark /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40 and see which program can scroll faster also while xterm may be slightly larger in ram requirements we do n't have any hard numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm 's paging requirements are not that major as an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm in summary caveat emptor your mileage may vary if you can provide some hard data i 'd like to see it

programs to work faster from scott barman scott asd.com comes a suggestion regarding motif text field widgets i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets i was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field examining the what was going on with xscope i found it it seems that when the resource xmnblinkrate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget or even just a text widget the i-beam cursor will blink every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server copyarea the user can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to it is not noticeable on a 40mhz sparc but it does make a little difference on a slower system this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server requests -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- miscellaneous suggestions -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- pretty pictures do n't use large bitmaps gif 's etc as root window backgrounds the more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc these take up ram and cpu power i work on a sun sparc and i'm conscious of performance issues i ca n't comprehend it when i see people with a 4mb sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window i 'll let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation if you 're anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway thanks to qiang alex zhao azhao cs.arizona.edu for reminding me of this one -- ed a quicker mouse using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse i use `` xset m '' in my .xinitrc file which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist see the xset man page for further ideas and information hint sometimes you may want to slow down your mouse tracking for fine work to cover my options i have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager e.g for twm menu `` mouse settings '' `` mouse settings '' f.title '' very fast '' `` xset m '' '' normal fast '' `` xset m '' '' system default un-accelerated '' `` xset m default '' '' glacial '' `` xset m '' programming thoughts joe english joe trystero.art.com to speed up applications that you 're developing there are tons of things you can do some that stick out for motif programs do n't set xmfontlist resources for individual buttons labels lists et al use the defaultfontlist or labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget again stick to as few fonts as possible better yet do n't use motif at all it 's an absolute pig do n't create and destroy widgets on the fly try to reuse them this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too use a line width of in gcs on some servers this makes a huge difference compress and collapse multiple expose events this can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one francois staes frans kiwi.uia.ac.be just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of xt based applications since they use malloc heavily they suggested trying out the gnuy malloc but i did n't find the time yet i did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable somewhat times faster any confirmation on this from anyone -- ed andre beck andre_beck irs.inf.tu-dresden.de unnecessary noexpose events most people use xcopyarea/xcopyplane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the gc used for the blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it 's event-loop again and again thousands of xchangegc requests this `` gfx context switching '' is also seen in most handcoded x-apps where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed again and again xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters this will remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the connection by moving it toward the client startup phase say what some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first david b. lewis by day dbl osf.org by night david craft uunet.uu.net how about this swap displays with someone else run all your programs on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your machine onto the other display goal reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server i 'm not in a situation where i can easily try this but i have received the following confirmation ... michael salmon michael.salmon eos.ericsson.se i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big difference i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion this helps a lot on my poor little ss1+ with only mb it was essential when i only had mb casey leedom casey gauss.llnl.gov the x11 server and the client are competing for the same cpu as your server when you run it on the same machine not really a major problem except that the x11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing timothy h panton thp westhawk.uucp firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu 's are mostly idle x's cpu usage is bursty so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small if they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action the second factor is that context switches are expensive using cpu 's halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe allowing

7, document_id from smb col.hp.com sam bauer subject for sale waxworks pc game for sale waxworks by horrorsoft/accolade 5.25 '' by the same folks who brought you elvira i ii i played elvira i ii and think that horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with waxworks the look and feel is roughly the same as in the elvira games though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive the first two games especially elvira ii jaws of cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult this is not to say that waxworks is a walk in the park but it is quite fair in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy in one of the four wax works to be explored there is no fighting at all well almost none though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles the really interesting thing about this game is that it is really broken up into four seperate rpgs one for each of the four exhibits you must enter in starting each one your character is transported with no objects to use and experience level one exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient egyptian pyramid which you must escape by fighting mapping and puzzle solving another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies this is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans kill the head plant alien and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up this is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit another exhibit puts you into jack the ripper england where you appear by the corpse of a fresh ripper victim and of course the police think you are responsible you must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of the ripper and meet him face to face but first get a disquise the last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to stop the almost indestructible zombies over all the vga graphics and music are very effective in setting a creepy tone for the game as was the case for the elvira games though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game i heartily recommend it for rpg and horror fans all prices include shipping all games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated us buyers only please all games will be shipped inside a box with packing insured priority usps all games include all original materials including box manual disks and registration unless otherwise noted the first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to get the game those just asking questions get no priority until they offer to buy the game lower offers may be considered assuming no other offers at asking price are made -- sam bauer hewlett packard co. -531-4460 network test division smb col.hp.com colorado springs co

8, document_id subject after-market cruise controls specific questions from mikew canc.byu.edu m.d mike wieda howdy i 'm a little new to this newsgroup but i would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here the subject after-market cruise controls the background i recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident places five screws yuk in two weeks i will be returning to texas my home from my school byu in provo utah as you can imagine trying to drive nearly miles with a broken right ankle is n't just the epitome of a good time my car does not have a cruise control so i would have to do all the pedalling ha ha with my messed-up ankle my question what is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units i realize that a cheap cc cruise control from say pep boys is n't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit if there is such a thing and i uderstand that i probably ca n't expect much in the way of accuracy looks and that sort of thing but anything 's got ta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle i have a jeep cherokee speed standard 2.5l engine with kettering sp ignition y'know distributor cap rotor that set-up -- not electronic maybe you could 've guessed it being an '84 but i 'm just trying to give information as completly as i can i found a cc unit for bucks it seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servor/motor is this good or bad if i did buy this cc which vacuum hose should i tap it has two speed sensors one magnetic and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pick-up or so i understand i can use either one which is best the manual says i read it in the store today that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate but harder to install is there really a big difference it has a sensor for the brake pedal just like other ccs but does not have a sensor for the clutch pedal so if i was n't paying real close attention i might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up which would wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned the thing off i 'm pretty coordinated so this does n't bother me if it were for my girlfriends car then it would bother me but i 'm ok with it the installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal i think i can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse am i right but i'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal or for that matter what exactly it is any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it i think i can figure the other things out like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit and the ground and all that miscellaneous business but i need a little help with is it worth the money and safety risk if any for such a device is there any particularly good after-market cc are `` professionally '' installed ccs signifacantly better and worth the cabbage if the unit i saw sorry no manufacturer or model number just that it is at pep boy and its is sufficient for my simple needs how do i get the thing installed properly specifically the questions above my father and i built a `` veep '' volkswagen powered jeep cj-2a when i was in high school so i consider myself fairly good with tools electronics and cars so the installation does n't scare me i just want to be certain that i get the thing installed correctly as my cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my veep i appreciate your time in reading my post and i would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject if you would like to share some of your wisdom please email as i do n't get over this group very often but i check my mail all the time again thanks for any help anyone may have mike wieda mikew canc.byu.edu

10, document_id from genetic+ pitt.edu david m. tate subject re young catchers mss netcom.com mark singer said we know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs especially when they have n't even played aaa ball yes but this is irrelevant you 're talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on i might as well say `` we know that very very few people are more than feet tall so chances are that manute bol is really only foot '' no maybe i need to improve my writing skills lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age having not played at aaa level that it is probably not a good idea to rush him into the braves lineup in why is n't lopez likely to hit that well he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did by a lot as for rushing ... if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i don't believe there is then would n't you rather waste lopez 's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use lopez was hitting .588 over ab when he was cut from spring training what does he have to do to earn a chance maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth gee i do n't know abs sounds pretty good to me about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a back-up role rather than start every day at aaa talk about me as a gm ... the point was not that ab is a significant sample but rather that he had n't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down `` until he gets warmed up '' ok most players are not ready for the bigs at age most players are never ready for the bigs what does this have to do with javy lopez most players benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa see above most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds most players are n't that good so they probably wo n't be that good this year either now the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans not superstars not stars not even good players maybe average if we're being charitable the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops ummm justice is a very fine hitter pendleton might have another big year in his bat but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell gant is a big question mark the bream/hunter platoon is decent not excellent and has rotten obp or slg depending on who 's in blauser is a very valuable bat ... for a shortstop the center field platoon will probably hit .300 however good lopez' bat might be given the above it wo n't be so much better than what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive ability wan na bet the difference between lopez 's bat and olson/berryhill could be or runs over the course of the season given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play i 'll take the latter every time the kid will improve playing at aaa just like keith mitchell did i am just so surprised i have to spell all of this out my goodness do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential that was me and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they really do n't understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization are they idiots who have built this ballclub well-argued but inflammatory reply deleted -- david m. tate i do not know what it is about you that closes posing as and opens only something in me understands e e can the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete rose 's dy cummings nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands
10," document_id from fierkelab bchm.biochem.duke.edu eric roush subject re young catchers since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx 40+ posts going back to the braves could be better off if an injury happens i may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame back at the beginning of spring training i though lopez would make the squad easily olson was still recovering from his late-season injury knee i believe and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before june and then berryhill was dinged up i was looking forward to this because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position before last season he was the braves `` defensive catcher '' prospect while brian deak was the braves `` offensive catcher '' prospect besides olson and berryhill could n't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and do n't walk enough to be useful but olson recovered quickly berryhill recovered and the braves went with the two vets i still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season he would n't have gotten his job back there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around after all ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear there are teams out there without one average ml catcher california and seattle come to mind certainly trying to move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work plus you 'd have to eat that salary which is n't huge but isn't tiddleywinks either i think olson 's at about 800,000 berryhill at 450,000 but that 's only what i recall yes i think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also what is it that 5/6 of the 2+year players are n't eligible for arbitration only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible of course the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet known from a business standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until june/the first time olson/berryhill go on the dl i am still disappointed that lopez is n't on the team i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves and the truth is that i 'd rather see our best team on the field which imo includes lopez of course today we play the cubs hopefully we wo n't need him as for the schuerholz/cox conversation i imagine it went like this remember they 've both been gm 's the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired cox ok we 've sent jones down his fielding could be a little smoother besides blauser can hit ok and his fielding is better than it used to be schuerholz well we 'll have to send nieves down too deion just wo n't sign that baseball only contract we ca n't count on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the defense besides gorman 's not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet once hatcher 's gone and deion signs we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez that ought to give us some pitching depth in cox yep that 'll be nice too bad deion wo n't sign ok i 'll look for nieves when justice starts having berry-berry ... er back problems again now what about klesko schuerholz well we 've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for bream if we keep klesko we either lose the money or cabrera i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he does n't seem to be the same gm first jeffries for jose and now whiten for clark if he gets rid of brian jordan then i 'd have to believe that he and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings cox ok keep trying on bream and i 'll wait til the trading deadline for my hunter/klesko platoon maybe i can get a few extra at-bats for cabrera while we wait try california ... if snow starts slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid and if that does n't work then perhaps sid 's knees could be `` persuaded '' to act up there 's always the 15-day dl mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha schuerholz what about caraballo cox well he 's not that much better than lemke maybe if he starts in richmond he 'll start walking more besides if he 's going to be arbitration-eligible better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks schuerholz now let 's see that leaves lopez cox nooooo i got ta keep lopez sure i did n't think olson would recover this quickly maybe i can talk caminiti into running into him again schuerholz nope lopez has got ta go you know that he 'll get million in arbitration may as well put it off that one extra year besides until olson 's shown his stuff a little bit i ca n't trade him besides berryhill 's a left-handed hitter you know how rare that is cox do n't you mean a left-handed whiffer pretty common if you ask me i mean he made pat borders look good in the world series pat borders schuerholz hey you 're the one who would n't write lopez into the lineup cox well you 're the one who went out and got me jeff reardon besides i thought lopez would n't be used to our pitching staff 's stuff he got some time with them this spring ... looked pretty good come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate schuerholz yeah but which stiff whichever one we keep will be hurt by may cox ok ok you made your point keep them both surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest then i can call up lopez and then we can win games the pennant the world series i 'll be up there with john mcgraw casey stengel earl weaver oh they laughed at me in toronto but have you ever had to deal with george bell i 'll finally get my just reward mwa-ha-ha-ha schuerholz easy bobby have you been taking those ''

writes bo jackson kcr .253 .243 .288 .455 kcr .274 .259 .314 .507 kcr .286 .272 .343 .519 cws .240 .225 .337 .394 maj .270 .256 .316 .489 maj this is what jackson looked like in 88-91 with everything converted to a neutral park on the basis of run production his equivalent average started at .253 in was up to .274 in and in so let us say he had established in his last two seasons a .280 level of play i 'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated it appears that in a neutral park bo 's hr and slugging tend to drop he actually loses two home runs or do they what is `` equivalent average '' one thing when looking at bo 's stats is that you can see that kc took away some homers normally you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks or to be caught and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway but bo despite his speed hit very few doubles and not that many triples so i would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park that is good very good in fact but it probably does n't make the top ten in the league the 10th best eqa in the al in was dave winfield 's .296 thomas was first at .350 first in the nl was bonds an incroyable .378 tenth was bip roberts .297 but .280 is better than any season in the past five years by joe carter it is about what mattingly had in .285 what felix jose had the last two years just ahead of time raines five-year average better than ryan klesko 's mles felix jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park i would offhand guess the 89- bo at around a .330/.530 player maybe .330/.550 not even close he got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing though his hype was a lot better than his hitting that is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated the media would have you beleive he was a great hitter i think he was a good maybe very good hitter he was imo something like the 30th best hitter in the majors i 'd put him about there too note i had n't realized the media had hyped him so much i thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player and only so-so at baseball he did only have one 30-hr 100-rbi season and kc wasn't winning note i maybe have harped on this a bit in the past but there is a mistake being made by the sdcn 's as they are known on this group with respect to players like bo and deion and lofton and perhaps others we find that if you look at a large group of players their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well their are some caveats the younger they are the less good the prediction the lower the minor league the less good i imagine the more recent the player has left college ball etc now of course this prediction involves quite a bit of `` error '' sometimes a player with poor mle 's dave justice the ventura becomes a star some hitters develop shane mack brian downing some do n't oddibe mcdowell mickey brantley this error involves real things there are real reasons why oddibe did n't hit and shane did it may who knows involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on but still you have this big pool of players and things work pretty well one of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players one thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them or almost all have spent a good deal of time playing ball their backgrounds are similar what has n't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background is there some reason to believe that a bo or a deion or a lofton or a tony gwynn or an ainge or so on has such a different background that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly it has n't been established that you can use mle 's with two-sport players it has n't been established that you ca n't but then statistics is after all an art i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about bo and deion and lofton `` look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers '' they say well what happens if those numbers simply do n't mean what they usually mean it might mean that ken lofton suddenly has a better year in houston than tuscon it might mean that deion suddenly has a better half-year in atlanta than greenville then again it might not ken and deion might go right back in the tank this year live up to those poor mle 's but you guys do n't know what 's worse you do n't know that you do n't and you do n't know that there are other players you wo n't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties again you seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal it 's not it 's got some error oh well bill guilford still thinks `` hairy butt is truly ugly '' might be right

to imply that neely is not a top offensive player btw in fact he 's one of my favourites even though he 's a damn bruin and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway but i think it will go six quebec vs. montreal this one is very tough to call montreal certainly has the experience factor but quebec is more talented imho it 'll come down to the goalies i 'll go with experience and roy canadiens in agreed here ... but montreal will be pushed to the limit is it just me or does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy go habs final boston vs. montreal will bruin domination continue in this rivalry yes moog has consistently outperformed roy in the playoffs after .. other stuff bruins in five i ca n't predict a montreal victory because i 've been watching them play for weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players especially to play in the garden last time they beat the b 's 5-2 but boston had a clear territorial advantage the victory was roy 's at the same time i can't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so i 'll just say i will not be putting money on this series patrick division semifinal pittsburgh vs. ny islanders what can i say the pens are flying high and have the most talent in the league agreed ny does n't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year pens in five which is credit to ny washington vs. new jersey capitals in agreed here too but i think it will go at least six jersey has a decent team and washington has done poorly against the division this year pittsburgh vs. washington if the caps had bill ranford i might see an upset but don beaupre just does n't inspire my hopes penguins in i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled i don't think it will go six either ... maybe five conference final pittsburgh vs. boston a replay of last year the penguins are just as good as months ago and the bruins are much improved but ... penguins in if pittsburgh plays boston imo they win in likely five possibly six they own the bruins if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once again i wo n't be putting money on the seventh game i say seven because the habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season campbell conference norris division semifinal chicago vs. st. louis or minnesota blackhawks in chicago will win but i think in at least six chicago is not that good imo and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties detroit vs. toronto the leafs have had an excellent season but they 've been playing playoff hockey all year the habs under burns were the same way and always wilted in the playoffs red wings in very true the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs toronto might win two or three at mlg though wings in six maybe even seven final chicago vs. detroit this will be a war fedorov will win it in ot red wings in it _will_ be a war ... possibly the most intense playoff series of them all and yes i think detroit will win probert will have to come up big though smythe division semi-finals vancouver vs. winnipeg canucks in our first disagreement canucks are playing like shit they do n't use their size at all which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team chasing them calgary .... winnipeg in six calgary vs. los angeles this would have been tough to call except for three things 1/ the kings do n't have a goalie 2/ gary roberts will be back 3/ the kings shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner paul coffey for a proven loser jimmy carson gretzky is just too weary to carry this group flames in this is also tough for me to call because i have n't seen the smythe enough i do n't think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a non-issue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate gretzky la in six final vancouver vs. calgary flames in if it is these two calgary will not need six games but i think it will be la-winnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice coference final detroit vs. calgary red wings in wow must 've been tough to go against your team but let 's see i picked la-detroit detroit will win probably in six stanley cup final pittsburgh vs. detroit three in a row and official 'dynasty status for the pens or can the wings complete a dream season well the wings are better in goal not sufficiently so though imho and have better d-men however mario and the boys can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoffs though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him the pens are just too much especially since detroit will have a tougher battle to get here penguins in if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i would n't bet against the wings they are very strong imo and nobody knows how strong because they 've been underachieving most of the year if forced to choose though i 'd have to take the penguins a side note vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than gilmour no way he is a more talented pure goal scorer ... but aside from the age difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team i 'm not asking for flames either btw .... i 've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he 's a great player but while he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge gilmour does it all i know a lot of gilmour-bashing goes on esp from flame fans but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill he is easily one of the best all-round players in the nhl dchhabra stpl.ists.ca

maple leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs from mounting any serious attack injuries pelle eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh roster moves jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game jason was the flyers second pick in the first round 15th overall of the entry draft years old '' lbs in games with the tri-city americans he had goals assists and pim he plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although bobby taylor said that bill dineen was planning to use him up front as well andre faust was returned to hershey he actually left after the second period of the kings game flew to albany got the game tying goal in a bears ot win and played again for hershey sunday night lines fedyk-lindros-recchi beranek-brind'amour-dineen lomakin-butsayev-conroy acton-brown galley-mcgill yushkevich-cronin carkner-hawgood bowen tommy soderstrom in goal acton replaced lomakin in the 3rd period game summary if the flyers played like this every night they 'd be in the playoffs this year the flyers hit everything that moved they created scoring chance after scoring chance they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found brind'amour crashing the net on the other side a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppa 's body should have been a goal but puppa made a great save reading the play garry galley gave the maple leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked doug gilmour at 4:25 the flyers lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill the maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every rebound after the power play the flyers got a goal on an ugly play rod brind'amour gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef beranek and bob rouse who were wrestling in the slot beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over puppa for a 1-0 flyers lead at 8:10 the flyers kept the pressure on and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers from building on their lead for a while eventually things settled down and defense prevailed each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were strong bowen started giving some lindros-like checks in his own corners then lindros who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the score he had foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice boards the only problem was that foligno was a little far from the boards and mike `` mister '' mcgeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38 the leafs could n't get anything going on the power play as the flyers were very aggressive for a change on the kill with time running out in the period recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to lindros as they approached the leaf 's blue line they were in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros tried a backhand pass to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi but then clark checked recchi off the puck macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to mcgill who had manned the point he drove it from just inside the blue line macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1 shots were 13-8 flyers in the period the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk tripped up rod brind'amour in his offensive zone during the power play the flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric gloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head we could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end as time was running out in the advantage lindros found galley with a pass across the goal mouth but puppa made the save the rebound kicked back to the right corner where recchi picked it up passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle and eric one-timed past puppa at 7:55 with the assist recchi moves past bobby clarke 's 74-75 season the second best one season total for a flyer at eric moves up to 4th all time in flyers rookie scoring with points mike eastwood took down al conroy at 8:30 to give the flyers another chance on the power play not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19 not much happened on the on although the leafs had most of the possession the flyers smothered the leafs short power play tempers flared a little at 13:14 bowen and pearson got roughing minors keith acton got a bloody face dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a on the replay showed that hawgood's stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyers smothered the leafs power play led by dimitri yushkevich bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot he made all the flyers look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stoned him the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didn't get anything home shots were 13-10 flyers the flyers were content with the goal lead in the third period and they decided that if tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a little the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first or so minutes of the period but could n't get past puppa then the leafs got tired of lindros making road kill out of them and tempers flared each for doug gilmour and lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and each for glenn anderson and mcgill roughing all at 7:02 terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on gilmour again the flyers smothered the leafs power play at about the minute mark dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through soderstrom the puck was rolling on it 's side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other seconds later rod brind'amour tripped up gilmour at 12:24 to give the leafs another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom stoned andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01 no punches thrown recchi got the initial minor krushelnyski baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors at 17:02 rouse and beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got each for slashing to set up another on mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers zone as they were battling for the puck and while mcgill was down he ran his stick across mcgill 's face the flyers were not happy with that at all 5-8 al conroy paired up with 6-1 berehowski and started throwing punches upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and al got a standing o penalties eastwood cross check game clark carkner each berehowski and conroy each fighting at 17:49 so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers the had no interest in stting on the lead hawgood galley and brind'amour played catch until hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past puppa at 18:39 that was all the fireworks tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppa did but kept the flyers off the board 4-0 flyers shots were 9-8 flyers in the 3rd probably the strongest game i 've seen from the flyers since the all star break shutout number for soderstrom all since 1/10 tied for 2nd most in the nhl but he 's played fewer games than belfour or the goalie i can't remember that he 's tied with next up it 's the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyers can not be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end flyers up to points on the season in games last year they had points in games under .500 so they need at least points in their last games to improve on that only by percentage points under in is better than under in tragic number holds at points with games left the tragic number for 5th is points i watched the rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before i finished this up why points instead of well the flyers will win the tie-breaker if they catch them whereas the islanders win tie breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie the rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the devils the pens twice the flyers and finish up with games against the caps so i guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to

the demo disk will decrypt files that have a char or less pw key '' how do i break a vigenere repeated-key cipher a repeated-key cipher where the ciphertext is something like the plaintext xor keykeykeykey and so on is called a vigenere cipher if the key is not too long and the plaintext is in english do the following discover the length of the key by counting coincidences see gaines gai44 sinkov sin66 trying each displacement of the ciphertext against itself count those bytes which are equal if the two ciphertext portions have used the same key something over of the bytes will be equal if they have used different key then less than 0.4 will be equal assuming random 8-bit bytes of key covering normal ascii text the smallest displacement which indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key shift the text by that length and xor it with itself this removes the key and leaves you with text xored with itself since english has about bit of real information per byte streams of text xored together has bits of info per 8-bit byte providing plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption and in fact one stream of text xored with itself has just bit per byte if the key is short it might be even easier to treat this as a standard polyalphabetic substitution all the old cryptanalysis texts show how to break those it 's possible with those methods in the hands of an expert if there 's only ten times as much text as key see for example gaines gai44 sinkov sin66 how do i send encrypted mail under unix pgp ripem pem ... here 's one popular method using the des

mailing list contact pem-dev-request tis.com there is a beta version of pem being tested at the time of this writing there are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting mail pgp and ripem both are available by ftp each has its own newsgroup alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem each has its own faq as well pgp is most commonly used outside the usa since it uses the rsa algorithm without a license and rsa 's patent is valid only or at least primarily in the usa ripem is most commonly used inside the usa since it uses the rsaref which is freely available within the usa but not available for shipment outside the usa since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of the message pgp used idea ripem uses des and rsa for encrypting the message key they should be able to interoperate freely although there have been repeated calls for each to understand the other 's formats and algorithm choices no interoperation is available at this time as far as we know is the unix crypt command secure no see ree84 there is a program available called cbw crypt breaker 's workbench which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks on files encrypted with crypt one source for cbw is ftpcb how do i use compression with encryption a number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by some simple encryption method e.g. xor with a repeated key unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact distribution of possible inputs for all practical purposes it's impossible to describe `` the typical english text '' beyond coarse characteristics such as single-letter frequencies you can build up more and more sophisticated models of your inputs but if the enemy has a slightly more accurate model he 'll be able to find some redundancy in your compressed output note that nearly all practical compression schemes unless they have been designed with cryptography in mind produce output that actually starts off with high redundancy for example the output of unix compress begins with a well-known three-byte `` magic number '' that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis this is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a bad idea it just has to be done very very carefully and by no means removes the need for strong encryption compression after encryption is silly is there an unbreakable cipher yes the one-time pad is unbreakable see part unfortunately the one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as plaintext of course a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful rather it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is expected to remain valid what does `` random '' mean in cryptography cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom number generator than most applications for a source of bits to be cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to predict what the nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of 0th through n-1st bits for all n up to the lifetime of the source a software generator also known as pseudo-random has the function of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently random bits this seed must be large enough not to be guessed by the opponent ideally it should also be truly random perhaps generated by a hardware random number source those who have sparcstation workstations could for example generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of entropy by not connecting anything to it for example cat /dev/audio compress foo gives a file of high entropy not random but with much randomness in it one can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key for example to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random string when looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy it is important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it looks complicated to a human it must be `` random '' for example disk operation completion times sound like they might be unpredictable to many people but a spinning disk is much like a clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy what is the unicity point a.k.a unicity distance see sha49 the unicity distance is an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number of ciphertext bits used ciphertexts significantly longer than this can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment this is used to back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have multiple equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security from the opponent 's difficulty choosing the correct one unicity distance like all statistical or information-theoretic measures does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives probabilistic results namely the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext when all possible keys are tried for the decryption working cryptologists do n't normally deal with unicity distance as such instead they directly determine the likelihood of events of interest let the unicity distance of a cipher be d characters if fewer than d ciphertext characters have been intercepted then there is not enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of possible keys des has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters which is less than ciphertext blocks each block corresponds to ascii characters this may seem alarmingly low at first but the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work required to find the key after approximately d characters have been intercepted in fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used in discussing unicity distance like other measures such as key size unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if it 's too small but does n't guarantee security if it 's high few practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis all manner of characteristics might serve as entering `` wedges '' to crack some cipher messages however similar information-theoretic considerations are occasionally useful for example to determine a recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most promising directions unfortunately most literature on the application of information statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified even the seminal work of alan turing see koz84 for some insight into the possibilities see kul68 and goo83 what is key management and why is it important one of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption of course one would assume that the cia does not make a habit of telling mossad about its cryptosystems but mossad probably finds out anyway repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thus especially in modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are transferred both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic key management refers to the distribution authentication and handling of keys a publicly accessible example of modern key management technology is the stu iii secure telephone unit which for classified use employs individual coded `` crypto ignition keys '' and a central key management center operated by nsa there is a hierarchy in that certain ciks are used by authorized cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and to perform installation/maintenance functions such as the reporting of lost ciks this should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem for public-key systems there are several related issues many having to do with `` whom do you trust '' can i use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from relatively compact generators perhaps the simplest example is a linear congruential sequence one of the most popular types of random number generators where there is no obvious dependence between seeds and outputs unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in a high enough dimension show up as a regular lattice mathematically this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for cryptanalysts to exploit more complicated generators have more complicated structure which is why they make interesting pictures -- but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable structure at all see knu81 exercise 3.5-7 ree77 and boy89 what is the correct frequency list for english letters there are three answers to this question each slightly deeper than the one before you can find the first answer in various books namely a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of english text of course any such list will be `` correctly '' computed but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken the second answer is that the question does n't make sense what do you mean by `` english letters '' the `` english language '' is not a fixed finite closed object that can be exactly characterized it has changed over time it is different between different authors any particular message will have different statistics from those of the language as a whole the third answer is that yes no particular message is going to have exactly the same characteristics as english in general but for all reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies wo n't matter in fact there 's an entire field called `` bayesian statistics '' other buzzwords are `` maximum entropy methods '' and `` maximum likelihood estimation '' which studies questions like `` what 's the chance that a text with these letter frequencies is in english '' and comes up with reasonably robust answers so make your own list from your own samples of english text it will be good enough for practical work if you use it properly what is the enigma `` for a project in data security we are looking for sources of information about the german enigma code and how it was broken by the british during wwii '' see wel82 dea85 koz84 hod83 kah91 how do i shuffle cards card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of values using a random or pseudo-random function all possible output permutations of this process should be equally likely to do this you need a random function modran x which will produce a uniformly distributed random integer in the interval .. x-1 given that function you can shuffle with the following c code assuming arrlth is the length of array arr and swap interchanges values at the two addresses given for n arrlth-1 n n -- swap arr modran n+1 arr n modran x can not be achieved exactly with a simple ranno x since ranno 's interval may not be divisible by x although in most cases the error will be very small to cover this case one can take ranno 's modulus mod x call that number y and if ranno returns a value less than y go back and get another ranno value can i foil s/w pirates by encrypting my cd-rom someone will frequently express the desire to publish a cd-rom with possibly multiple pieces of software perhaps with each encrypted separately and will want to use different keys for each user perhaps even good for only a limited period of time in order to avoid piracy as far as we know this is impossible since there is nothing in standard pc or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the keyboard if there were such an identification then the cd-rom could be encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in part on the unique identifier however in this case the cd-rom is one of

12, document_id from ld231782 lance.colostate.edu l. detweiler subject an open letter to mr. clinton i 'm quite astonished shocked and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerging american freedoms the clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography to do so is tantamount to regulating acceptable speech and is blatantly unconstitutional perhaps we should rename this year in honor of such an illustrious proposal let the crappy chip live in infamy and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure i am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures the u.s. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this and i call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal the administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals it seems to me that u.s diplomatic communications should be tappable by the u.n. whenever any countries produce a warrant to the u.n in fact i think we should stop paying the nsa billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason these actions violate the sovereignity of international law i hope mr. clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here but if he is n't it 's a modest and reasonable proposal so he should find merit with it nevertheless cryptography is neutral technology if everybody has strong cryptography including policemen bureacrats businessmen housewives thugs and hoodlums we have a sustainable equilibrium anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian arrangement intrinsically antithetical to american freedoms and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent impracticality we do n't need to compromise on issues of freedom for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans for too long our government has demonstrated itself to be increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality and protecting americans since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law it is not possible for the federal government to `` act quickly '' or develop `` consistent comprehensive policies '' period and even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible it would only be an efficient way to deprive american citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights the administration has to be committed to leaving private industries alone esp on this issue the government has no legitimate role in regulating the content of communications law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon they are soon and inevitably to be disarmed of it q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices no such laws can be constitutionally sound and this is equivalent to a veiled threat which i do n't appreciate this kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism i will trade threats for threats and violation for violation the administration is not saying `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright '' as some countries have effectively done if the administration did say this it would find itself impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential established entrenched and explicit constitutional privacy guarantees the administration would have no legal standing whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast segments of the population nor is the u.s. saying that `` every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product '' the u.s. comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government is saying just that take your chips and give them to nsa employees as christmas bonuses we can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please and we will make any chips we please and we will send any bit pattern over our data highways we please and if you try to stop us you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness privacy vs. law enforcement there is a false `` tension '' created in the assessment that this issue is an `` either-or '' proposition this is an outright dingaling denning lie the two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible and you have to work for the nsa to think otherwise americans are about to discover ways through the use of technology to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and unrepresentative

faq is posted to the newsgroups sci.answers and news.answers every days contents what is a product cipher what makes a product cipher secure what are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers what can be proven about the security of a product cipher how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication what exactly is des what is triple des what is differential cryptanalysis how was nsa involved in the design of des is des available in software is des available in hardware can des be used to protect classified information what are `` ecb '' `` cbc '' `` cfb '' and `` ofb '' encryption what is a product cipher a product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak operations such as substitution transposition modular addition/multiplication and linear transformation a `` block cipher '' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data -- -8 bytes say -- -all at once then goes on to the next block the notion of product ciphers is due to shannon sha49 examples of modern product ciphers include lucifer sor84 des nbs77 sp-networks kam78 loki bro90 feal shi84 pes lai90 khufu and khafre me91a the so-called feistel ciphers are a class of product ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round lucifer des loki and feal are examples of feistel ciphers the following table compares the main parameters of several product ciphers cipher block length key bits number of rounds lucifer des loki feal 2^x x pes what makes a product cipher secure nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is completely secure so in practice one begins by demonstrating that the cipher `` looks highly random '' for example the cipher must be nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends on every bit of the plaintext and the key meyer mey78 has shown that at least rounds of des are required to guarantee such a dependence in this sense a product cipher should act as a `` mixing '' function which combines the plaintext key and ciphertext in a complex nonlinear fashion the fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are referred to as s-boxes for example lucifer has s-boxes and des has s-boxes the nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a careful design of these s-boxes a list of partial design criteria for the s-boxes of des which apply to s-boxes in general may be found in brown bro89 and brickell et al bri86 what are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers let e be a product cipher that maps n-bit blocks to n-bit blocks let e_k x be the encryption of x under key k. then for any fixed k the map sending x to e_k x is a permutation of the set of n-bit blocks denote this permutation by p_k the set of all n-bit permutations is called the symmetric group and is written s_ 2^n the collection of all these permutations p_k where k ranges over all possible keys is denoted e s_ 2^n if e were a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect e s_ 2^n to generate a large subset of s_ 2^n coppersmith and grossman cop74 have shown that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternating group a_ 2^n given a sufficient number of rounds the alternating group is half of the symmetric group it consists of all `` even '' permutations i.e. all permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps even and goldreich eve83 were able to extend these results to show that feistel ciphers can generate a_ 2^n given a sufficient number of rounds the security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group-theoretic properties of a cipher multiple encipherment is an extension over single encipherment if for keys k1 k2 there does not exist a third key k3 such that e_k2 e_k1 x == e_ k3 x which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys k1 k2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key k3 if for every k1 k2 there exists a k3 such that eq is true then we say that e is a group this question of whether des is a group under this definition was extensively studied by sherman kaliski and rivest she88 in their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that des is not a group in fact des is not a group cam93 what can be proven about the security of a product cipher recall from above that p_k is a permutation produced by e under some key k. the goal of the designer of e is to ensure that p_k appears to be a random element of s_ 2^n the symmetric group let r be an element of s_ 2^n selected randomly we will say that p_k and r are indistinguishable if an observer given p_k and r in some order can not distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial time that is with time bounded resources the observer can not determine which of the permutations is produced by e the optimal decision is no better than simply guessing luby and rackoff lub88 have shown that a class of feistel ciphers are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by random boolean functions how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size there are four standard `` modes of operation '' and numerous non-standard ones as well the standard modes of operation are defined in the u.s. department of commerce federal information processing standard fips published in see the question about `` ecb '' below for more details although they are defined for the des block cipher the `` modes of operation '' can be used with any block cipher can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication one may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation but one can not prove these things to another without revealing the key and thereafter that key can not be used to prove anything about any messages that were authenticated using that key see ansi x3.106-1983 and fips for a standard method of message authentication using des what exactly is des des is the u.s. government 's data encryption standard a product cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data using a 56-bit key it is defined in fips 46-1 which supersedes fips fips are federal information processing standards published by ntis des is identical to the ansi standard data encryption algorithm dea defined in ansi x3.92-1981 what is triple des triple des is a product cipher which like des operates on 64-bit data blocks there are several forms each of which uses the des cipher times some forms use two 56-bit keys some use three the `` des modes of operation '' may also be used with triple-des some people refer to e k1 d k2 e k1 x as triple-des this method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ansi standard x9.17-1985 `` financial institution key management '' and is intended for use in encrypting des keys and ivs for `` automated key distribution '' its formal name is `` encryption and decryption of a single key by a key pair '' but it is referenced in other standards documents as ede that standard says section 7.2.1 `` key encrypting keys may be a single dea key or a dea key pair key pairs shoud be used where additional security is needed e.g. the data protected by the key s has a long security life a key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a single key '' others use the term `` triple-des '' for e k1 d k2 e k3 x or e k1 e k2 e k3 x one of us carl ellison keeps advocating des triple use in the form e k1 tran e k2 tran e k3 compress x where each des instance has its own key and iv for cbc mode and tran has been posted on it is a large-block transposition program taking its key from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on its own part what is differential cryptanalysis differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be applied to any iterated mapping ie any mapping which is based on a repeated round function the method was recently popularized by biham and shamir bih91 but coppersmith has remarked that the s-boxes of des were optimized against this attack some years ago this method has proved effective against several product ciphers notably feal bi91a differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of ciphertexts y y whose corresponding plaintexts x x satisfy a known difference d x+x where is componentwise xor in the basic biham-shamir attack 2^ such plaintext pairs are required to determine the key for des substantially fewer pairs are required if des is truncated to or rounds in these cases the actual key can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs for full des this attack is impractical because it requires so many known plaintexts the work of biham and shamir on des revealed several startling observations on the algorithm most importantly if the key schedule was removed from des and a 768-bit key was used the key could be recovered in less than 2^ steps thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to des further the s-boxes of des are extremely sensitive in that changing even single entries in these tables yields significant improvement in the differential attack adi shamir is quoted to say nytimes oct `` i would say that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence of tampering with the des so that the basic design was weakened '' how was nsa involved in the design of des according to kinnucan kin78 tuchman a member of the group that developed des at ibm is quoted as saying `` we developed the des algorithm entirely within ibm using ibmers the nsa did not dictate a single wire '' tuchman and meyer another developer of des spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in lucifer they then spent two years strengthening lucifer `` their basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation and key scheduling functions ... ibm has classified the notes containing the selection criteria at the request of the nsa .... the nsa told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep secrets it uses to make its own algorithms explains tuchman '' on the other hand a document called `` involvement of the nsa in the development of des unclassified summary of the united states select committee on intelligence '' printed in the ieee communications magazine p53-55 states `` in the development of des nsa convinced ibm that a reduced keysize was sufficient indirectly assisted in the development of the s-box structures and certified that the final des algorithm was to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness '' clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the nsa the article further states that the nsa did not tamper with the algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of meyer and tuchman presented above is des available in software several people have made des code available via ftp see part for pathnames stig ostholm ftpso bsd ftpbk eric young ftpey dennis furguson ftpdf mark riordan ftpmr phil karn ftppk a pascal listing of des is also given in patterson pat87 fips 46-1 says `` the algorithm specified in this standard is to be implemented ... using hardware not

secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state-of-the-art microcircuit called the `` clipper chip '' has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a `` key-escrow '' system will be established to ensure that the '' clipper chip '' is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique '' keys '' numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two `` key-escrow '' data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the `` clipper chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the `` clipper chip '' and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key-escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates -- the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and -- the need of u.s. companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high-speed networks `` information superhighways '' will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today 's telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are

administration's telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no `` clipper chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow data banks a the two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on-going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the `` clipper chip '' a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the `` clipper chip '' into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright '' as some countries have effectively done nor is the u.s. saying that `` every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product '' there is a false `` tension '' created in the assessment that this issue is an `` either-or '' proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the `` clipper chip '' and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u.s. companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for u.s. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products

do n't ask notes such as `` kah67 '' refer to the reference list in the last part the sections of this faq are available via anonymous ftp to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part xx the cryptography faq is posted to the newsgroups sci.answers and news.answers every days contents in mathematical terms what is a private-key cryptosystem what is an attack what 's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically why is the one-time pad secure what 's a ciphertext-only attack what 's a known-plaintext attack what 's a chosen-plaintext attack in mathematical terms what can you say about brute-force attacks what 's a key-guessing attack what 's entropy in mathematical terms what is a private-key cryptosystem a private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system e and a decryption system d. the encryption system e is a collection of functions e_k indexed by `` keys '' k mapping some set of `` plaintexts '' p to some set of `` ciphertexts '' c. similarly the decryption system d is a collection of functions d_k such that d_k e_k p p for every plaintext p. that is succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key index as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext into ciphertext such systems wherein the same key value is used to encrypt and decrypt are also known as `` symmetric '' cryptoystems what is an attack in intuitive terms a passive attack on a cryptosystem is any method of starting with some information about plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts under some unknown key and figuring out more information about the plaintexts it 's possible to state mathematically what this means here we go fix functions f g and h of n variables fix an encryption system e and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys an attack on e using g assuming f giving h with probability p is an algorithm a with a pair f g of inputs and one output h such that there is probability p of computing h h p_1 ... p_n if we have f f p_1 ... p_n and g g e_k p_1 ... e_k p_n note that this probability depends on the distribution of the vector k p_1 ... p_n the attack is trivial or `` pointless '' if there is probability at least p of computing h h p_1 ... p_n if f f p_1 ... p_n and g g c_1 ... c_n here c_1 ... c_n range uniformly over the possible ciphertexts and have no particular relation to p_1 ... p_n in other words an attack is trivial if it does n't actually use the encryptions e_k p_1 ... e_k p_n an attack is called `` one-ciphertext '' if n `` two-ciphertext '' if n and so on what 's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically in basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure read part we keep saying `` a strong cryptosystem must have this property but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem is strong '' in contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely formulate and if possible prove the statement that a cryptosystem is strong we say for example that a cryptosystem is secure against all passive attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system as defined above is too slow to be practical if we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any passive cryptanalytic technique if we can reduce this statement to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that the cryptosystem is n't easy to break other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical definition again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions we 're making and prove that they produce the desired results we can figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used properly it just means that the assumptions are valid the same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too the cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumptions often he can try to construct a proof of security for a system see where the proof fails and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis why is the one-time pad secure by definition the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the plaintexts ciphertexts and keys are all strings say byte strings of some length m and e_k p is just the sum let 's say the exclusive or of k and p. it is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad assuming a uniform distribution of keys note that we do n't have to assume a uniform distribution of plaintexts here 's the proof let a be an attack i.e. an algorithm taking two inputs f g and producing one output h with some probability p that h h p whenever f f p and g g e_k p i.e. g g k p then because the distribution of k is uniform and independent of p the distribution of k p must also be uniform and independent of p. but also the distribution of c is uniform and independent of p. hence there is probability exactly p that h h p whenever f f p and g g c over all p and c. thus a fortiori a is trivial on the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key k is used for more than one plaintext i.e. there are nontrivial multiple-ciphertext attacks so to be properly used a key k must be thrown away after one encryption the key is also called a `` pad '' this explains the name `` one-time pad '' what 's a ciphertext-only attack in the notation above a ciphertext-only attack is one where f is constant given only some information g e_k p_1 ... e_k p_n about n ciphertexts the attack has to have some chance of producing some information h p_1 ... p_n about the plaintexts the attack is trivial if it has just as good a chance of producing h p_1 ... p_n when given g c_1 ... c_n for random c_1 ... c_n for example say g c c and say h p is the first bit of p. we can easily write down an attack -- -the `` guessing attack '' which simply guesses that h p is this attack is trivial because it does n't use the ciphertext it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no matter what on the other hand there is an attack on rsa which produces one bit of information about p with success using c. if it is fed a random c then the success rate drops to so this is a nontrivial attack what 's a known-plaintext attack the classic known-plaintext attack has f p_1 p_2 p_1 g c_1 c_2 c_1 c_2 and h p_1 p_2 depending only on p_2 in other words given two ciphertexts c_1 and c_2 and one decryption p_1 the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption p_2 note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature as producing information about the key but this is pointless the cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him decrypt further messages what 's a chosen-plaintext attack a chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem attacks where the cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor these attacks do n't fit into our model of passive attacks explained above anyway a chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and look at the corresponding ciphertext then repeat until he has figured out how to decrypt any message more absurd examples of this sort of attack are the `` chosen-key attack '' and `` chosen-system attack '' a much more important form of active attack is a message corruption attack where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a way as to make a useful change in the plaintext there are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks for instance automatically encrypting any plaintext p as t e_k h t+r+p r p where t is a time-key sequence number chosen anew for each message r is a random number and h is a one-way hash function here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or in mathematical terms what can you say about brute-force attacks consider the following known-plaintext attack we are given some plaintexts p_1 ... p_ n-1 and ciphertexts c_1 ... c_ n-1 we're also given a ciphertext c_n we run through every key k. when we find k such that e_k p_i c_i for every i n we print d_k c_n if n is big enough that only one key works this attack will succeed on valid inputs all the time while it will produce correct results only once in a blue moon for random inputs thus this is a nontrivial attack its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many possible keys what 's a key-guessing attack what 's entropy say somebody is using the one-time pad -- -but is n't choosing keys randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages as he was supposed to for our security proof in fact say he 's known to prefer keys which are english words then a cryptanalyst can run through all english words as possible keys this attack will often succeed and it 's much faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace we can measure how bad a key distribution is by

_________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state-of-the-art microcircuit called the `` clipper chip '' has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a `` key-escrow '' system will be established to ensure that the '' clipper chip '' is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique '' keys '' numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two `` key-escrow '' data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the `` clipper chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the `` clipper chip '' and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key-escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates -- the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and -- the need of u.s. companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high-speed networks `` information superhighways '' will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today 's telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology 975-2758 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- questions and answers about the clinton administration's telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no `` clipper chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow data banks a the two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on-going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the `` clipper chip '' a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the `` clipper chip '' into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright '' as some countries have effectively done nor is the u.s. saying that `` every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product '' there is a false `` tension '' created in the assessment that this issue is an `` either-or '' proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the `` clipper chip '' and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u.s. companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for u.s. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products -- -- -- -- -- end included article -- -- -- -- -- -- pat rwing.uucp without prejudice ucc 1-207 pat myrto seattle wa if all else fails

12, document_id from danny weitzner djw eff.org subject re-inventing crypto policy an eff statement april initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security proposal the clinton administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of americans the first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption and law enforcement issues posed by new technology however eff is very concerned that the administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any public comment or discussion has been allowed apparently the administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the national security agency the so-called `` clipper chip '' is an 80-bit split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor two separate escrow agents would store users keys and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant the encryption scheme used is to be classified but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products this proposal raises a number of serious concerns first the administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry the nsa-developed clipper chip may not be the most secure product other vendors or developers may have better schemes furthermore we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the clipper or any other chips rather independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards second an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested yet the administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified eff believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open the public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent expert scrutiny third while the use of the use of a split-key dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted what will give people confidence in the safety of their keys does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual 's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries these are but a few of the many questions the administrations proposal raised but fails to answer in sum the administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security however the `` clipper chip '' solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry and not be adopted before the discussion even begins details of the proposal escrow the 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom hold 40-bits of each key the manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents a key is tied to the device however not the person using it upon presentation of a valid court order the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents according to the presidential directive just issued the attorney general will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents some in the administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency perhaps the federal reserve and one non-governmental organization could be chosen but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet classified algorithm and the possibility of back doors the administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the president will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm in order to prove this administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the algorithm for trap doors the results of the investigation would then be made public the clipper chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source secret contract between the national security agency and two private firms vlsi and mycotronx nsa work on this plan has been underway for about four years the manufacturing contract was let months ago government as market driver in order to get a market moving and to show that the government believes in the security of this system the feds will be the first big customers for this product users will include the fbi secret service vp al gore and maybe even the president at today 's commerce department press briefing a number of people asked this question though why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors comprehensive policy inquiry the administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection encryption and law enforcement the items to be considered include export controls on encryption technology and the fbi 's digital telephony proposal it appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the national security council unfortunately however the presidential directive describing the

12, document_id from strnlght netcom.com david sternlight subject re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key-escrow though some may argue about the nose of the camel it 's worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony if it is only used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption then it is an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to easy-to-break inverters note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files let 's focus on this one question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it though i share many of the concerns expressed by some i find the proposal less threatening than many others since right now most americans have no secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a `` goat '' can eavesdrop this would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones -- -- -- reading between the lines i infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys this would meet the needs of u.s. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including french and japanese security services and rich japanese companies it allows the nsa to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs most legitimate u.s. corporations trust the nsa and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them even at the price of depositing keys in escrow i see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week and that system has worked pretty well from my point of view this is a fair starting point there are concerns that need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows but in return we get access to high-security crypto many have suggested that des and other systems may be breakable by the nsa and hence others similarly skilled and endowed there is at least a good possibility which should be checked that the proposed system is not so breakable it does n't have to be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order -- -- -- in discussing this let 's try to avoid the nastiness personal attacks and noise of some previous threads this is a substantive and technical issue and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion -- david sternlight great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information errors and omissions excepted

nsa is the official security body of the u.s. government it was given its charter by president truman in the late 's and has continued research in cryptology till the present the nsa is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world governments in general have always been prime employers of cryptologists the nsa probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice but for reasons of national security almost all information about the nsa is classified bamford 's book bamfd gives a history of the people and operations of the nsa the following quote from massey mas88 highlights the difference between public and private research in cryptography `` ... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed doors without doubt the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in cryptology for only about years has there in fact been widespread open research in cryptology there have been and will continue to be conflicts between these two research communities open research is common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly journals but can a government agency charged with responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations countenance the publication of a cipher that it can not break can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government 's code-breakers one might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would force all governments to behave like stimson 's gentlemen but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most scientific fields the wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology but rather that these conflicts at least those of which we are aware have been so few and so mild '' what are the us export regulations in a nutshell there are two government agencies which control export of encryption software one is the bureau of export administration bxa in the department of commerce authorized by the export administration regulations ear another is the office of defense trade controls dtc in the state department authorized by the international traffic in arms regulations itar as a rule of thumb bxa which works with cocom has less stringent requirements but dtc which takes orders from nsa wants to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa the newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export what people think about those laws and many other complex issues which go beyond the scope of technical groups like make sure to consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in jail if you are lucky your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at least heard of the itar what is tempest tempest is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer equipment it was created in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation e.g. from a crt at quite a distance and with little effort needless to say encryption does n't do much good if the cleartext is available this way what are the beale ciphers and are they a hoax thanks to jim gillogly for this information and john king for corrections the story in a pamphlet by j b ward goes

theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis-proof in practice why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break what is cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key the story begins when julius caesar sent messages to his trusted acquaintances he did n't trust the messengers so he replaced every a by a c every b by a d and so on through the alphabet only someone who knew the `` shift by '' rule could decipher his messages a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so that only certain people can see through the disguise cryptography is the art of creating and using cryptosystems cryptanalysis is the art of breaking cryptosystems -- -seeing through the disguise even when you 're not supposed to be able to cryptology is the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis the original message is called a plaintext the disguised message is called a ciphertext encryption means any procedure to convert plaintext into ciphertext decryption means any procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext a cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms the algorithms are labelled the labels are called keys for instance caesar probably used `` shift by n '' encryption for several different values of n. it 's natural to say that n is the key here the people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are called recipients other people are enemies opponents interlopers eavesdroppers or third parties what references can i start with to learn cryptology for an introduction to technical matter the survey articles given in part are the best place to begin as they are in general concise authored by competent people and well written however these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has developed in the last years or so and are more abstract and mathematical than historical the codebreakers by kahn kah67 is encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up to the mid-60 's introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from gaines gai44 or sinkov sin66 this is recommended especially for people who want to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of many public researchers to problems in cryptology consequently several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared the book of denning den82 gives a good introduction to a broad range of security including encryption algorithms database security access control and formal models of security similar comments apply to the books of price davies pri84 and pfleeger pfl89 the books of konheim kon81 and meyer matyas mey82 are quite technical books both konheim and meyer were directly involved in the development of des and both books give a thorough analysis of des konheim 's book is quite mathematical with detailed analyses of many classical cryptosystems meyer and matyas concentrate on modern cryptographic methods especially pertaining to key management and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and networks the books of rueppel rue86 and koblitz kob89 concentrate on the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography how does one go about cryptanalysis classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern finding patience determination and luck the best available textbooks on the subject are the military cryptanalytics series frie1 it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is for the most part gained through the attempted solution of given systems such experience is considered so valuable that some of the cryptanalyses performed during wwii by the allies are still classified modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer or taking a discrete logarithm these are not the traditional fare of the cryptanalyst computational number theorists are some of the most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems what is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance in a nutshell if f x y and you know y and can compute f you can find x by trying every possible x that 's brute-force search example say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding ciphertext but does n't know the key he can simply try encrypting the plaintext using each possible key until the ciphertext matches -- -or decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever is faster every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this brute-force search is impractical advances in technology sometimes change what is considered practical for example des which has been in use for over years now has 2^56 or about 10^17 possible keys a computation with this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the mid-70 's the situation is very different today given the dramatic decrease in cost per processor operation massively parallel machines threaten the security of des against brute force search some scenarios are described by garron and outerbridge gar91 one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret a strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace as mentioned above the unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and if for some key the unicity distance is much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system is probably strong a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests see for example cae90 a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks a system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect if a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily strong certainly not many weak cryptosystems looked good at first however sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is strong by mathematical proof `` if joe can break this system then he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring integers '' see part failing that it 's a crap shoot if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis-proof in practice cryptanalytic methods include what is known as `` practical cryptanalysis '' the enemy does n't have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext for instance he might assume `` cribs '' -- -stretches of probable plaintext if the crib is correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the message or he might exploit `` isologs '' -- -the same plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys thus he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he does n't have a chance sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are misused the one-time pad for example loses all security if it is used more than once even chosen-plaintext attacks where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key have been employed see kah67 why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break some do n't know any better often amateurs think they can design secure systems and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst could do and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody to invest the work needed to crack a system

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the white house office of the press secretary _________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state-of-the-art microcircuit called the `` clipper chip '' has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a `` key-escrow '' system will be established to ensure that the `` clipper chip '' is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique `` keys '' numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two `` key-escrow '' data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the `` clipper chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the `` clipper chip '' and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key-escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates -- the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and -- the need of u.s. companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high-speed networks `` information superhighways '' will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today 's telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology 975-2758 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- questions and answers about the clinton administration's telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no `` clipper chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow data banks a the two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on-going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the `` clipper chip '' a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the `` clipper chip '' into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright '' as some countries have effectively done nor is the u.s. saying that `` every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product '' there is a false `` tension '' created in the assessment that this issue is an `` either-or '' proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the `` clipper chip '' and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u.s. companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for u.s. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products

14, document_id from turpin cs.utexas.edu russell turpin subject re science and methodology -- -- in article c5i2bo.cg9 news.hawaii.edu lady uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lee lady writes the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology it depends on the quality of their thinking it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies ... and i 'm especially offended by russell turpin 's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes simply avoiding mistakes does n't get you anywhere i think that lee lady and i are talking at cross purposes above lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps in most of this thread i have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not lee lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought but what is the difference between einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy some would give velikovsky or korzybski as examples if you do n't like these choose your own i say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi both einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong both velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this let me approach this from a second direction when one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference there are many kinds of criticism that one can make one kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed another kind of criticism is that the work while technically correct is either not important or not interesting the first difference is the one that i have been pointing to the second difference is the one that lee lady seems to be discussing if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information but it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science this is where you and i disagree with turpin i have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims not just of some of its proposed remedies similarly i suspect that traditional chinese medicine has many remedies that work what it lacks as one example is any experiment that tests the presence of qi ... in order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses certainly a `` theoretical structure that makes sense '' is the goal in areas where we do not yet have this i see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses let 's face it we can not always wait for an einstein to come along and make everything clear for us sometimes those of us who are not einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can russell

to go see a doctor as soon as you possibly can the difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn-out ordeal go see a doctor now your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems do n't wait though go see a doctor the remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from a wonderful report by new zealand 's department of labour occupational safety and health service `` occupational overuse syndrome treatment and rehabilitation a practitioner 's guide '' first a glossary or fancy names for how you should n't have your hands note you 're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors rsi repetitive strain injury a general term for many kinds of injuries oos occupational overuse syndrome -- synonym for rsi ctd cumulative trauma disorder -- another synonym for rsi wruld work-related upper limb disorders -- yet another synonym for rsi cts carpal tunnel syndrome see below hyperextension marked bending at a joint pronation turning the palm down wrist extension bending the wrist up supination turning the palm up wrist flexion bending the wrist down pinch grip the grip used for a pencil ulnar deviation bending the wrist towards the little finger power grip the grip used for a hammer radial deviation bending the wrist toward the thumb abduction moving away from the body overspanning opening the fingers out wide now then problems come in two main types local conditions and diffuse conditions local problems are what you 'd expect specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurt diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and/or tingling with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles although they 're not necessarily `` the problem '' -- why does occupational overuse syndrome occur here 's the theory normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers when you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow by the time you 're exerting of your full power you 're completely restricting your blood flow without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid which cause pain once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the load this makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion more tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves they need blood too anyway when you 're typing too much you 're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make things worse -- specific injuries you may have heard of note most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic acute injuries are severely painful and noticable chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath 's ability to lubricate the tendon as a result the tendon sheath thickens gets inflamed and you 've got your problem tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more swelling and more pain `` sub-acute '' tendonitis is more common which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse with repetitive activity carpal tunnel syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them symptoms include feeling `` pins and needles '' tingling numbness and even loss of sensation cts is often confused for a diffuse condition adverse mechanical tension -- also known as 'neural tension this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere amt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos disorders it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy others for just about every part of your body there 's a fancy name for a way to injure it by now you should be getting an idea of how oos conditions occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you like surgery ==4== typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment the most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons this requires learning how to relax if you 're under a load of stress this is doubly important tune out the world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work every three minutes take a three second break every three minutes take a three second break really do it every three minutes it 's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax if you ca n't sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep and relaxation are really a big deal there are all kinds of other treatments of course drugs can reduce inflamation and pain custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture surgery can fix some problems exercise can help strengthen your muscles regular stretching can help prevent injury good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling only your doctor can say what 's best for you -- posture -- here are some basic guidelines i so liked the way this was written in the new zealand book that i 'm lifting it almost verbatim from appendix -- dwallach let your shoulders relax let your elbows swing free keep your wrists straight pull your chin in to look down do n't flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try leaning back in the chair do n't slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every minutes get up and bend your spine backward set the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at if you are short this may be impossible the beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area if you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available now i diverge a little from the text a good chair makes a big difference if you do n't like your chair go find a better one you really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rests seem to get in the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that 's right for you in the san francisco bay area i highly recommend `` just chairs '' the name says it all -- keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements there is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for some people wrist pads seem to work wonders however with good posture you should n't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be `` right there '' if you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about degrees of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs wrist pads may or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax it's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed a number of replacements are available on the market today check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail ==5== requests for more info clearly the above information is incomplete the typing-injury archive is incomplete there 's always more

show about major u.s. water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee-type disease outbreak to national desk environment writer contact erik olson or sarah silver 202-783-7800 both of the natural resources defense council washington april -- internal epa data released today by the natural resources defense council reveals that about large water systems -- serving cities from boston to san francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting milwaukee the epa list is attached `` these internal epa documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many american cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration '' said erik olson a senior attorney with nrdc `` water contamination is n't just a problem in bangladesh it 's also a problem in bozeman and boston '' `` as of june about large surface water systems on epa 's list probably will be breaking the law the safe drinking water act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution '' olson continued some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law 's deadline olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities a survey of u.s. surface water systems by water utility scientists found that percent of raw water samples contained the milwaukee organism cryptosporidium and percent contained a similar parasite called giardia adding to the level of concern a general accounting office study released today by house health and environment subcommittee chairman henry waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation 's system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems `` this new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink we must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public '' olson noted `` the time has come for many of the nation 's water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination

juice internally for about months d.m.s.o dimethyl sulfoxide causes cancer cells to perform normal cell functions almonds un-blanched un-roasted contain laetrile to help prevent cancer eat several almonds every day to help cure cancer eat several ounces of almonds per day never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally it will kill you take it intravenously only cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile into cyanide which then kills the cell this enzyme is also present in the digestive system anti-oxidants are free-radical scavengers and include vitamin e selenium mcg per day is safe for most people chromium up to mcg per day vitamin a 25,000 iu per day is safe for most people superoxide dismutase up to 4,000,000 units per day vitamin c up to mg. per

spreading herpes to other people but will not cure herpes bht might also do these things against `` a.i.d.s `` which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia see the book `` life extension '' by durk pearson and sandy shaw hydrogen-peroxide dilute twelve drops of hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water preferably distilled and drink it do this once or twice per day hours before or after eating or drinking anything else apply hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day use hydrogen-peroxide only if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants described above vitamin mineral supplements are more effective and much less expensive when combined together in mega doses into single tablets made from natural sources cancer cells can not live in a strong 100,000 maxwell north magnetic field especially if it is pulsating on and off a strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac in my opinion all types of ionizing- radiation treatments for cancer should be replaced with daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-maxwell north magnetic fields properly made and operated radionics/psionics machines can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer as well as most other medical problems some radionics/psionics machines can even take cross-sectional x-ray-like photos of cancer tumors etc. with-out x-rays interferon tablets taheebo tea lapacho homeopathy can cure cancer and many other medical problems even drug addiction mg. per day of chelated zinc can help prevent or cure prostate trouble this list is not exhaustive the above natural remedies can cure both diagnosed and un- diagnosed cancers as well as prevent them and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart- diseases they are not too simple and inexpensive to work effectively besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these remedies especially the 7-day fast and the grape diet send a strong message to one 's subconscious mind programming it to cure the cancer in my opinion if a person finds out that s/he has cancer then s/he should promptly try at least the first remedies described above in sequence

information on stressfree another typing management tool for windows typing management tools these aim to help you manage your keyboard use by warning you to take a break every so often the better ones also include advice on exercises posture and workstation setup some use sound hardware to warn of a break others use beeps or screen messages often rsi appears only after many years of typing and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening these tools act as an early warning system by

ftp servers and bitnet servers does not include general info on rsi and ergonomics but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises tool typewatch freeware version 3.8 october available from email to richardd hoskyns.co.uk anonymous ftp soda.berkeley.edu pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar platforms unix tested on sco sunos mach character and x window mode description this is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing based on how long you have been continuously typing it does not provide exercises but it does check that you really do take a break and tells you when you can start typing again typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today each time it warns you which is useful so you know how much you really type it also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out the warning message appears on your screen in character mode in a pop-up window for x windows or as a zephyr message for those with athena stuff tim freeman tsf cs.cmu.edu has put in a lot of bug fixes extra features and support for x zephyr and mach not formally supported but email richardd hoskyns.co.uk for sco sunos character mode or tsf cs.cmu.edu for mach x window mode zephyr if you have problems or want to give feedback tool various calendar batch queue programs available from various sources platforms various description any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc rsi management tool or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen using windows as an example create a calendar file and include this filename in your win.ini 's 'load= line so you get it on every startup of windows suppose you want to have breaks every minutes starting from am press f7 special time ... to enter an appointment enter 9:30 hit enter and type some text in saying what the break is for then press f5 to set an alarm on this entry and repeat for the next appointment by using windows recorder you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a .rec file put this file on your 'run= line as above and you will then with a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments with rsi exercises the above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs an example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break this will depend a lot on your operating system while these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you ca n't get hold of a suitable rsi management tool if you are techie enough you might want to write a version of typewatch see above for your operating system using batch jobs or whatever fits best tool digital watches with count-down timers available from various sources e.g casio bp-100 description many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically while these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you are writing reading driving or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing comments my own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which actually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the left arm improved getting a count-down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where i write a lot in a day i have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period keyboard remapping tools these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout one-handed typing tools may help but be very careful about how you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing and may therefore make matters worse tool hsh public domain available from anonymous ftp soda.berkeley.edu pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar platforms unix do n't know which ones description allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings only works through tty 's so you can use it with a terminal or an xterm but not most x programs tool dvorak keyboard tools various available from anonymous ftp soda.berkeley.edu pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c also built into windows 3.x description the dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use it may help prevent rsi a bit but you can also use it if you have rsi since it will slow down your typing a lot -- dan wallach `` one of the most attractive

14, document_id from lindae netcom.com subject re morbus meniere is there a real remedy in article pitt.uucp geb cs.pitt.edu gordon banks writes in article lindaec4jglk.fxm netcom.com lindae netcom.com writes my biggest resentment is the doctor who makes it seem like most people with dizziness can be cured that 's definitely not the case in most cases like i said above it is a long tedious process that may or may not end up in a partial cure be sure to say `` chronic '' dizziness not just dizziness most patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better the vertiginous spells of meniere 's will also eventually go away however the patient is left with a deaf ear all true and all good points to anyone suffering with vertigo dizziness or any variation thereof my best advice to you as a fellow-sufferer is this ... just keep searching ... do n't let the doctors tell you there's nothing that can be done ... do your own research ... and let your this may have helped you but i 'm not sure it is good general advice the odds that you are going to find some miracle with your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge for this or any other disease are slim when good answers to these then spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical problem may divert that energy from more productive things in life a limited amount should be spent to assure yourself that your doctor gave you the correct story but after it becomes clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine has no good solution perhaps the best strategy is to join the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to make a career out of it well making a career out of it is a bit strong i still believe that doing your own research is very very necessary i would not have progressed as much as i have today unless i had spent the many hours in stanford 's med library as i have done and years ago it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me so should i have stopped searching thank goodness i did n't now i found that there is indeed medicine that helps me i think that what you 've said is kind of idealistic that you would go to one doctor get a diagnosis maybe get a second opinion and then move on with your life just as an example ... having seen of the top specialists in this field in the country i have received different diagnoses these are the top names the ones that people come to from all over the country i have had to sort all of this out myself going to a support group and in fact heading that support group was helpful for a while but after a point i found it very unproductive it was much more productive to do library research make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself a recent movie lorenzo 's oil offers a perfect example of what i 'm talking about if you have n't seen it you should it 's not a put down of doctor 's and neither is what i 'm saying doctors are only human and can only do so much but there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed i guess i 'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown if i had a broken arm or a weak heart or failing kidneys i might not have the same opinion that 's because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments with dizziness you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it i have chosen the latter linda lindae netcom.netcom.com -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- gordon banks n3jxp `` skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb cadre.dsl.pitt.edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon '' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

14, document_id from jer prefect.cc.bellcore.com rathmann janice e subject re sinus vs. migraine was re sinus endoscopy i noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularly motrin at the time i seemed to get a lot of migraines but had forgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts here i generally do n't take nsaids or tylenol for headaches because i've found them to be ineffective however i have two other pain sources that force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn first is some pelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period and then much worse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past ~12 years ago so the drs tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back i 've tried synarel it reduced the pain while i took it mos but the pain returned immediately after i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only `` real solution '' to my problem although i do n't expect to have any more children i do n't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when i had the surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggested i get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children so basically all i 'm left with is toughing out the pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or something similar but not aspirin that does n't work and motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago so i 'm through with it in fact naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i take it regularly as i did when i had severe back pain and pain in both legs as i 'll discuss in a moment generally though i wait until i have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain it 's actually quite effective at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while in the meantime i 'm frequently in severe pain the other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy i 've had mris xrays ct scan and emgs i 've had of them and do n't intend to ever do that again with nerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i have several bulging degeneratig disks and from the xrays and mri i think it is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scan was that there are two herniations l3-l4 and l4-l5 but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horrible test called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the '' internal nerves '' are working fine anyway the bottom line is that i sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back pain is there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is there i need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse so i 'd always resume since last november i have taken it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physical therapy for the last months 2-3 times a week after the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlier but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at a lower weight after a month or two the pain in my legs began going away but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage so now i do n't have nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off traction about weeks ago getting back to my original reason for this post ... even if i can avoid taking analgesic for headaches i really ca n't avoid them entirely because i have other pain sources that `` force '' me to use them oh i forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgery but i 'm avoiding that too i find the migraines difficult to deal with occassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but at a reduced capacity i 'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing when the pelvic pain is bad i ca n't concentrate much i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because the pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad it can cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad i ca n't really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time home and in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a lot of migraines an average of to a month which last 1-3 days i 've taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me so i reduced the dosage but i do n't like the side effects if i take more than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i will eventually take the cafergot my neurologist was n't very helpful when i told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan becomes available i should try that i 've tried several other medications fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but they either did n't work or i could n't tolerate them so what can i do my doctor 's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot of pain i 've had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stopped once from the anesthesia i was told that it was likely the succinylcholine and i 've already had surgery several times anyway the point of what i 'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines some people need to take them to tolerate other pain janice rathmann

mcdonnell douglas rolled out its dc-x rocket ship last saturday the company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit ssto rocket ship the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands missile range in new mexico this week flight tests will start in mid-june although there was n't a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for ssto research remains cloudy the sdi organization -- which paid million for the dc-x -- ca n't itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital dc-xa sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns however recent changes in sdi 's political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto less of a priority today the agency is more interested in using dc-x as a step towards a low-cost reusable sounding rocket sdio has already done briefings to other government agencies said col. simon `` pete '' worden sdio 's deputy for technology but worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program `` i did n't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i have available to spend '' he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell douglas astronautics headquarters while sdio has lowered its sights on the program 's orbital objective agency officials hail the dc-x as an example of the `` better faster cheaper '' approach to hardware development the agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that `` leapfrog '' ahead of evolutionary technology developments worden said the dc-x illustrates how a `` build a little test a little '' approach can produce results on time and within budget he said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around months -- showed how today 's engineers could move beyond the `` miracles of our parents time '' `` the key is management '' worden said `` sdio had a very light hand on this project we had only one overworked major jess sponable '' although the next phase may involve more agencies worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial `` it 's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially '' sdio 's approach also won praise from two california members of the house science space and technology committee `` this is the direction we 're going to have to go '' said rep. george brown the committee's democratic chairman `` programs that stretch aout to years aren't sustainable .... nasa has n't learned it yet sdio has '' rep. dana rohrbacher brown 's republican colleague went further joking that `` a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team '' rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency rohrbacher whose orange county district includes mcdonnell douglas also criticized nasa-air force work on conventional multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology `` let 's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top let 's build a spaceship '' although rohrbacher praised sdio 's sponsorship he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology mcdonnell douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its c-17 transport and space station freedom programs were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment `` on very large ventures companies put in seed money '' said charles ordahl mcdonnell douglas' senior vice president for space systems `` you need strong government investments '' while the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the dc-xa they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development citing corporate history they liken the process to douglas aircraft 's dc aircraft just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the dc-3 transport a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper dc-1 flight tests this summer at white sands will `` expand the envelope '' of performance with successive tests increasing speed and altitude the first tests will reach feet and demonstrate hovering verticle take-off and landing the second series will send the unmanned dc-x up to 5,000 feet the third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet maneuvers will become more complex on third phase the final tests will include a `` pitch-over '' manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft four-legged landing the flight test series will be supervised by charles `` pete '' conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo moon landing now a mcdonnell douglas vice president conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance if the program moves to the next stage engine technology will become a key consideration this engine would have more thrust than the pratt whitney rl10a-5 engines used on the dc-x each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust based on the engine used in centaur upper stages the a-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union the resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes the mechanism for the teaming may already be in place pratt has a technology agreement with npo energomash the design bureau responsible for the tri-propellant and energia cryogenic engines"

15," document_id from dbm0000 tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov david b. mckissock subject nasa `` wraps '' in the april edition of `` one small step for a space activist '' allen sherzer tim kyger write `` another problem is what are called 'wraps or sometimes the 'center tax when work for a large program like freedom or shuttle is performed at a nasa center the center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts to a slush fund this money is used to fund work the center manager wants to fund this sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated think about that of the billion cost of freedom fully billion wo n't be spent on anything having anything to do with space stations now maybe that billion was wisely spent and maybe it was n't but the work done with it should stand on its own merits not distorting the cost of other projects congress has no idea of the existense of these wraps congress has never heard the term 'center tax they look at the station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it does n't add up they wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else '' my dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here a couple of weeks ago when i first read this in your posting i talked with one of the cost experts here in space station at headquarters if you wondering why i did n't post a response immediately i do have a real job i 'm supposed to be doing here at headquarters digging up old khz data looking into sherzer/kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority also i spent last weekend in kansas city at the national science teachers association conference extolling the virtues of ssf to 15,000 science teachers first off yes the concept of 'center tax or 'wrap does exist if i recall the numbers correctly the total 'tax' for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around million this was computed by adding up the wp-1 wp-2 and wp-4 center 'taxes with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at 2.2 billion my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 1.8 over the life of the ssf program using your figure of billion for the cost of ssf a tax at a 1.8 rate comes to million this is alot less than billion but i will concede it 's still an appreciable amount of pocket change i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate the tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center kind of like mcdonalds at some states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you do n't if you get it take-out for example at wp-4 the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the rocketdyne contract and are not subject to the center tax i do n't have the numbers in front of me but i 'd guess at least of the wp-4 funds go to rocketdyne so you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3 but it 's only applied to funds spent at the center and not to the prime contracts this leads to the obvious question `` what is the government doing with ssf funds that do n't go to the prime contractors i.e ok wp-4 gets a slice of the billion pie a big portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne what happens to the balance of the funds which are n't eaten up by the center tax '' at wp-4 we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds as they are supporting the development work done by rocketdyne we have used these funds to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture our testbed has a real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research a few years back with lead-acid car batteries to simulate the nickel-hydrogen batteries on ssf dc switchgear dc-dc converter units and simulated loads data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system we have also used the supporting development money to purchase nickel hydrogen batteries which are on life testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in indiana as a side point of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year as a final example my 'home division at lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations for performing system analyses like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculations using a monte-carlo simulation setting up a database with information on weight of the power system elements finally the money raised by the 'tax does not all go into a 'slush fund at lewis the director does control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter most of the tax however goes to fund the 'general' services at the center like the library the central computer services division the contractor who removes the snow etc thus it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget does n't go for ssf activities to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support ssf which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for year is 'billable to ssf would you base it on the person-hours ssf employees spend reading av-week versus the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare this estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library who knows maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about a burecratic nightmare my last point is that i ca n't believe your claim that congress has never heard of the term 'center tax unfortunately all of the nasa testimony before congress is n't on a computer so i ca n't do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong but surely in some gao audit somewhere these nasa cost methods were documented for congress"

took some of his research and called it my own but he started it '' `` so what if i stole his car he stole my lawnmower first '' besides that i think it 's still open to interpretation whether nick

based process and your response does n't tell me a thing about the reasons why you think they should be except to impune the motives of the person with a divergent opinion who said i think they should be tommy show me a note where i said that and i 'll eat this terminal see below fred fred i cocluded that you did since you took issue with it the fact that my conclusion was incorrect i.e that you were taking issue with something different is evidence that your communication style is confusing or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate first i try to address what i think you meant for which i am rewarded with a denial of sorts and a smart remark then i point out that i am not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly interpreting you a second time and i 'm stupid for it i just ca n't win can i fred you 've got a great point here somewhere it 's just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it please quote the 'it i took issue with i believe you will see if you look that what i was and am taking issue with is mr szabo 's idea that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his toaster-based infrastructure is finished all hail the szabo plan fred issue nick 's alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nick 's or you would have a really good point instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had my reading of what nick actually said is that `` people are n't required in all parts of all space processes '' so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program i read as `` people are required in all parts of all space processes '' so help me out here fred since i'm so patently stupid did you read nick wrong or are you going to eat your terminal now if the latter i sure hope it 's one of those cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about the point is _i_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption i'd only be stupid if i insulted you for having made it but alas that 's your job fred and finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points simultaneously with an allegory/insult sadly one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone more deliberate lack of understanding tommy no no i finally got it you do n't like the plan that nick 's posts made you imagine and you do n't like nick 's obnoxious behavior even though it 's no worse than your own thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself if you have a problem with nick 's delivery address that the way you bait you 're perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of no tommy the 'bait is that which elicits the response nick 'baits i just flame him for being an obnoxious fool i do n't really care who started it i read this list to get information and other 's views on the issues to which it was dedicated not to be your mom he started it no he did or to hear about why nick is a very bad guy if you think flaming is bad stop flaming or at least get to the point in the first post instead of explaining yourself all the time that 's nice tommy when you pay me to post to the net you can complain about not getting your money 's worth perhaps if you weren't deliberately too thick to get the point the first time i wouldn't have to waste time `` explaining myself all the time '' of course socrates how could it be otherwise i think it 's neat how all this criticism from you started after your 'fatherly admonitions to me about how such things should be handled outside usenet were somewhat rebuffed being a little hypocritical tommy to go with the immaturity or is this just the pique of a net.ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he thought was new and hence could be 'instructed -- tommy i saw you come on the net who cares who came on the net first if you do consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus before which i was on for about years if you had seen me on the net first you 'd remember when nick and i went down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior it's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own let 's see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers is n't and my complaints about your name-calling are immature while your name-calling is n't yeah right maybe if you called me some more names i might see it better fred `` net.ghod wannabe '' naturally fred you 've correctly interpreted my motivations when yours are impossible to judge from your actions as your insulting of people that try proves i did n't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what i really wanted was to impress everyone i only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail not because it belongs there but because i thought you were such a jerk that you 'd bring it back to the net playing right into my hands alas i had no idea what an intellectual master you were turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me whether i should feel stupid because i tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect or becuase i tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass still is n't clear well fred you exposed me now i 'll never be able to get a nother job with nasa since they all know that i 'm stupider than fred mccall well i just hope you 're happy please leave me alone now i just don't have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above

'' was substituted some text read by a lay couple the priest certainly should not have given this part of the mass over to others and i was so disturbed that i declined to receive communion that night we are n't required to anyway -- i instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish so we 've been wondering -- are we the oddballs or is the quality of the mass going down i do n't mean that facetiously we go to mass every thursday or friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of god 's presence but as far as the obligatory sunday masses ... maybe i should just offer it up has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in catholic masses lately the quality of the mass has not changed again if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the church it would still be `` liturgically '' beautiful the problem comes about from people trying to be `` creative '' who are not i think the answer to your question on participation could be that given by father peter stravinskas in answer to the question posed by the title of thomas day 's _why catholics ca n't sing_ `` they don't want to '' because of all this nonsense by the way for any non-catholics reading this the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the catholic church but by those who are disobedient to the church in changing it on their own `` authority '' steve creps indiana university creps lateran.ucs.indiana.edu

16, document_id from halsall murray.fordham.edu paul halsall subject catholic liturgy the problems with catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time the problem is in a nutshell this the liturgy is a symbolic action in other words catholics do or should believe that the _signs_ during the mass water blessings vestments altar relics etc are real that is the sprinkling of water bestows real almost tangible holiness the vestments are a real indication of real sacred time the point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying real referent this kind of thinking precludes analysis holy water is not holy because of anything it simply is holy but modern westerners find it extremely difficult especially if well- educated to think of the mass as a symbol we are more likely to see it as a _sign_ ie an action that represents grace but which could be replaced with other signs in concrete terms this means the mass has become a commercial for god 's grace rather than the real thing you can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing ask coca-cola co. these attitudes have been encouraged by liturgy workshops etc which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy you can only create signs symbols have to come from god or the heart or somewhere deeper than analysis the most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species the consecrated host and wine now with pita bread etc it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles if the host is a sign of grace this isnt and issue but catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of jesus body modern catholic liturgy is caught in this epistemological shift we try to perfrom the old rites but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain what we are doing so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it this is not a soul filling experience it does n't help btw that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music again a result of mis-analysis complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones this was the genius of wesley and the 19c anglican hymn writers taize is only slightly better what are we to do well i suggest rejecting the parish system if it does n't work for you search out a church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained they exist in every city this is not btw a matter of particular style the music might be old or new it is the attitude of the church that counts also note that a conservative liturgy harking back to pre-vatican ii days does not necessarily mean the church will be socially conservative in nyc i can recommend corpus christi w 12st st. corpus christi w 12st st. very conservative liturgy st. joseph 's greenwich village modern `` clean '' largely gay oratorian church brooklyn very beautiful avoid anywhere anytime a church with electric candles happy easter christos aneste christos voskrezhne christ is risen paul halsall halsall murray.fordham.edu

absolutes is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes the answer to both questions is yes perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then to me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations etc true in every instance possible do you agree with this definition i think you do similarly all truth is absolute indeed a non-absolute truth is a contradiction in terms when is something absolute when it is always true obviously if a `` truth '' is not always `` true '' then we have a contradiction in terms i agree with carol here determining absolutes is practically speaking a waste of time and we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relative for example i recently was asking some children the question `` what temperature does water boil at '' i got the answer degrees consistently i asked if they knew what scale and was told `` it 's just degrees any scale that 's what all thermometers say '' well that 's sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong it is not an absolute truth similarly scripture is full of truth which we should nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism imo example of head-covering in church deleted this was a good example there may be an absolute truth behind the writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the corinthians and not necessarily elsewhere the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth which was having a lot of trouble with order is it absolute truth to me no and i see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there are plenty of other examples can you reconcile this even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally i 've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse `` blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks '' literally the bible was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world such a statement is terribly self-contradictory let me put it to you this way if there are no absolutes should n't we conclude that the statement `` there are no absolutes '' is not absolutely true obviously we have a contradiction here i do n't claim that there are no absolutes i think there are very few though and determining absolutes is difficult i agree very few and even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference since i know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me there is hardly consensus even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation so people sometimes disagree about what is true this does not negate the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe i ca n't prove the existence of absolutes i can only rely upon my experience i also trust god 's revelation that we can not fully comprehend the infinite therefore we ca n't comprehend the absolutes so i do n't need them i can never know the essence of god only the energies by and through which god is manifested to god 's creation so the reality can be that there are absolutes but it is of no practical importance it 's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be swell who cares it does n't affect me in any practical useful way i might as well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that they live on mars maybe god did so what is that going to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor or god whether or not i go to this or that cafeteria for lunch no this attitude leads many non-christians to believe that all christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning christianity is true wonderful and sensible it appeals to reason since reason is an inner reflection of the logos of god explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world note i 'm not claiming there is no place for authority that 'd be silly there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that and is generally agressive good parents like god are authoritative

apr.2.01.58.09.1993.17541 athos.rutgers.edu writes i can only reply with what it says in timothy 3:16 i 'm not here to discount parts of the bible rather i'm here only to discount the notion of `` revelation '' the author of timothy told what he thought was the truth based on his belief in god his faith in jesus as the resurrected son and his readings of the old testament but again what had been revealed to him was based on at best second-hand information given by friends and authors who may not have given the whole truth or who may have exaggerated a bit first of all the original poster misquoted the reference is from tim 3:16 the author was paul and his revelations were anything but `` at best second-hand '' `` and is came about that as saul journeyed he was approaching damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him `` saul saul why are you persecuting me '' and he said `` who art thou lord '' and he said `` i am jesus whom you are persecuting '' acts 9:3-5 nas paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus pretty cool eh he became closely involved with the early church the leaders of which were followers of jesus throughout his ministry on earth now you may say `` the holy spirit revealed these things unto him '' and we could go into that argument but you 'd be hard-pressed to convince me that the holy spirit exists i agree i do n't believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you the spirit exists please do n't complain about this being circular i know it is but really can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural this is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the bible additionally what he has written is again second-hand info if it were given by the spirit and still carries the chance it is not true the spirit is part of god how much closer to the source can you get the greek in timothy which is sometimes translated as `` inspired by god '' literally means `` god-breathed '' in other words god spoke the actual words into the scriptures many theologians and bible scholars dr. james boice is one that i can remember off-hand get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of `` inspired by god '' the only way you would be able to escape this notion of `` second-hand '' info is to have had the entire bible written by god himself and to tell the truth i've studied the bible extensively and have yet to hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence showing god as the first author of this collection of books that 's what the verse taken from timothy was all about the continuity of a book written over a span of years by more than authors from all walks of life is a testimony to the single authorship of god and as for reason read what it says in corinthians 1:18-31 about human wisdom basically it says that human wisdom is useless when compared with what god has written for our learning if you knew of jesus as well as you know the bible you'd realize he reasoned out the law and the prophets for the common man what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the bible certainly not josephus writings or the writings of the gnostics which were third century at the earliest and though some claim jesus was he was human with all of the human wisdom the apostle paul set out to criticize yet would you not embrace the idea that jesus was wise jesus was fully god as well that 's why i 'd assert that he is wise i realise that you may not accept the authority of the bible this is unfortunate to say the least because there is no other way of learning about god and christ and god 's purpose with the earth than reading the bible and searching out its truth for yourself for your information i was raised without any knowledge of god by the time some of the faithful came to show me the word and share with me its truth i was living happily and morally without acknowledging the existence of a supreme being i have though read the bible several times over in its entirety and have studied it thoroughly it contains truth in it and i consider jesus to be one of the most moral of human beings to have lived in fact i darn-near idolize the guy but there 's no rational reason for me to except god's existence please rethink this last paragraph if there is no god which seems to be your current belief then jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that god exists but he claimed to be god himself regards to c.s lewis how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus in conclusion be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars unsubstantiated claims the bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out about your reading of the bible not only does the spirit inspire the writers but he guides the reader as well we can not understand it in the least without the spirit 's guidance '' for to us god revealed them through the spirit for the spirit searches all things even the depths of god '' cor 2:10 nas peace and may god guide us in

16, document_id from xx155 yfn.ysu.edu family magazine sysops subject the empty tomb ... the empty tomb can we trust it by the late wilbur m. smith d.d 1894-1977 when jesus was on earth he made an amazing prediction about himself and frequently repeated it let me quote it for you behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again '' matthew 20:18-19 wholly different from the normal experience of men jesus who had never done anything worthy of death even deserving reproval knew he would die before he was years of age he knew the very city where he would die he knew that the religious leaders of his own race would condemn him to death he knew that one of his own would betray him he knew that before his actual death took place he would be mocked and scourged he knew exactly how he would die -- by crucifixion all this is in itself remarkable but more amazing than the minute particulars of his foreknowledge was what he predicted would follow shortly after he was buried -- that he would rise again he even designated the time -- on the third day but since it is on this central fact -- the death and resurrec- tion of jesus christ -- that the whole truth or untruth of chris- tianity turns let us examine it more closely the body of jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed the body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used and a great stone was rolled against the entrance the jewish authorities fully aware that jesus had predicted he would rise again had the stone officially sealed and on saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body early sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body to their utter astonishment they found the stone rolled away the body gone they rushed back to tell the disciples shortly two of jesus friends peter and john utterly skeptical about the whole affair came and found the tomb empty just as the women had said even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone matthew 28:11 how did this tomb become empty one of the most famous new testament scholars in america -- professor of new testament literature in a large theological seminary -- wrote to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb became empty and wrote it in a letter not marked by bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the chimney at christmas time but he did n't realize that santa clause never did come down any chimney at christmas time because there never was a santa claus ... and there is a jesus he died he was buried in the tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sunday the body was gone those are facts of history no one can escape the responsi- bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old another professor dr. kirsopp lake of harvard university tried to explain the empty tomb by saying what no other scholar in the field of new testament criticism has ventured to adopt that the women went to the wrong tomb the facts are these first so far as we know there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone second it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days even if the women did miss the tomb when peter and john came did they too go to the wrong tomb third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb there is of course a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor 's ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is com- monly reported among the jews until this day matthew 28:11-15 this is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty you will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb was empty they never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true -- they knew it was true another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty -- the soldiers were told to say that jesus disciples came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep how could they know what was going on while they were asleep obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of jesus first as professor heffern points out the leaders of judaism in jerusalem who had put the lord jesus to death had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his resurrection -- because all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty if there had been trickery here sooner or later it would have been suspected then proved second surely one of the disciples even most of them would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent it may be possible to live a lie but men seldom die for a lie -- and most of these men did the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories -- it would have lost it power instead this truth swept the world closed pagan temples won millions of disciples brought hope to a despairing humanity was the very foundation truth of the early church and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever but not only did jesus come alive again he did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to him instead he appeared to them -- literally visibly frequently he appeared to the women at the tomb on resurrection morning matthew 28:1-10 later that day to mary magdalene alone john 20:11- and to simon peter also alone luke 24:34 in the afternoon he walked with two of his followers toward emmaus luke 24:13-35 and that night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at jerusalem mark 16:14-16 luke 24:36-40 etc. a week later he appeared to all eleven of the apostles probably at the same place john 20:26-28 once he was seen by above brethren on a mountain in galilee i corinthians 15:6 and finally to the apostles just before his ascension mark 16:19 luke 24:50-52 acts 1:3- as with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor- ically recorded appearances all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness but these theories are unreasonable without supporting evidence none has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances moreover while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle increase mather president of harvard timothy dwight president of yale nathan lord president of dartmouth edward hitchcock president of amherst mark hopkins president of williams john witherspoon president of princeton -- these men and countless others have believed it but suppose christ did rise from the dead what of it what has it to do with my life what has it to do with your life just this it seals with certitude the teachings of christ jesus taught many great truths -- especially many about himself he claimed to have come down from god he said he was the way to god he said he was the son of god who alone knew god perfectly he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life and no one else had it he said that whatever we ask god in his name he would grant it to us thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day he revealed that in these amazing unparalleled predictions he spoke the truth do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe that his words are all true the point is does not the truth of the resurrection convince us that he is none other than the one he claimed to be -- the son of god and then of course the fact that christ rose from the dead testifies that he has broken the power of death and that he will some day raise us also up from the grave as he promised in other words if this person jesus christ the son of god in all this he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life for he said a life built on him would know forgiveness of sins his compan- ionship and help a joy that no circumstances can ever take away and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day those who have tried it down through the ages -- and there have been many -- have given their testimony and we today who believe also know

'' norris athena.mit.edu writes this is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of- nature fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is a class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science for example why does the universe exist at all must there be a `` why '' to this i ask because of what you also assume about god -- namely that he just exists with no `` why '' to his existence so the question is reversed `` why can't we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to `` just exist '' why must there be a `` why '' to the universe '' after all the time-space world did n't have to exist why does anything exist and is it possible for persons e.g man to come into being out of a purely impersonal cosmos these questions which look at the real mysteries of life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be found outside that world in its source it may be that one day man not only can create life but can also create man now i do n't see this happening in my lifetime nor do i assert it is probable but the possibility is there given scientists are working hard at `` decoding '' out `` genetic code '' to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation again though must there be `` why '' or a `` divine prupose '' to man 's existence when you say that man is only an animal i have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma if you will and one the requires a kind of `` faith '' too by taking such a hard line in your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own as far as we can tell man falls into the `` mammal '' catagory now if there were something more to the man say a soul then we have yet to find evidence of such but as it is now man is a mammal babies are born live mother gives milk we're warm-blooded etc as other mammals are and is similar in genetic construction to some of them in particular primates for more on this check out talk.origins but before you write off all christianity as phony and shallow i hope you 'll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by reading paul johnson 's `` a history of christianity '' from your remarks it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of christian religion and not others even an atheist should have enough faith in man to know that a movement of years has to have some depth and be animated by some enduring values well then buddhism confucianism taoism hinduism judaism zoerasterism shintoism and islam should fit this bit of logic quite nicely ... all have depth all have enduring values thus all must be true ... stephen _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ atheist _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ libertarian _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ pro-individuality _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ pro-responsibility _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ jr. and all that jazz ... --

address a perceived need the biological aspect of humans is deified that is all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical structure with biology at the apex needless to say i disagree with your strong opinion and the underlying presuppositions christianity is an infectious cult the reasons it flourishes are because it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind `` oh wow .. all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness '' for all of you `` found jeezus '' how many of you were `` on the brink '' i disagree that christianity is `` an infectious cult '' it has certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system in spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia that it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is '' infectious '' in a derrogatory sense it may be that it provides a workable system for its adherents and i would argue that this is the case i disagree that christianity is `` a safety blanket '' which supplants hope and purpose rather it points an individual to the one source of hope and purpose there is nothing hidden about a christian 's source for hope and purpose of what usefulness to you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose and externally given hope and purpose is the apparent loss of control over one 's own life the problem or is it something else finally one does not appropriate `` eternal happiness '' by following christian moral standards indeed the sole reason for the existance of christianity is because standards are inadequate to save people from their imperfections moral standards are merely guides to the christian the real power to moral living is given to the christian in the person of god 's spirit heaven is one of two final states that christian doctrine postulates however christians are generally not motivated to live according to christian moral standards by this promised future reward rather they are motivated by the perceived benefits to them in the here-and-now but i digress ... the other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature a best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -- priority spread the word many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a priority and rightly so for it was jesus himself who gave this as a priority for his followers however it is not the penultimate priority as evangelism is normally understood i.e preach the word convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangelism is generally best done through respecting the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits of a christian lifestyle this demonstration should be so powerful that it compels the non-christian to seek out the christian to ask '' why '' needless to say such a demonstration is not easily accom- plished it takes a radical committment to the person of jesus it does not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian is required and it can not occur where no personal bonds of friendship exist it is ineffective with strangers who can not evaluate the demonstration over time and it is easy to alienate or harm others if the sole purpose of being a `` friend '' is to gain a conversion as a long-time christian nearly years i view with some skep- ticism all evangelism programs which incorporate a `` hurry-up '' attitude pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no conversion at all because the pressured convert realizes s/he was coerced and disavows christianity when they would have been open to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now the bible states that it is the very spirit of god which brings conviction of wrong-doing to people i am content to do my part witness and let the spirit do the rest we are _just_ animals we need sleep food and we reproduce and we die we are far more than animals we sleep eat reproduce and die just as other animals do true but we are also capable of more than this if your personal vision of humanity or of yourself is so limited i can only hope and pray that you will someday find a more expansive view for reflection what animals have the wide variety of performing arts that humans do how is it that humans can learn the language of other humans or animals but that other animals can not do so how is it that humans can organize themselves in various social structures whereas other animals have only one structure religion especially christianity is nothing more than a drug blatant assertion christianity is not physically addictive christianity is not psychologically addictive christianity is not a thing which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up it is a relationship with a living being you might as validly characterize any close- knit relationship with this appelation some people use drugs as an escape from reality christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high there are `` jesus freaks '' who let the emotional aspects of worship and christian living gain and retain the upper hand even so this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these things flow it pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars of which christianity has had no small part guilty by association that `` christianity '' which forces itself upon another is not christianity at all when christians see a `` non-believer '' they say that person is blind to the truth but they can not realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day jesus was just prophet who happened to have a large influence because at that time the romans were circa 69ad dispersing the jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need you appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened years ago how did you come by it i can not accept your conclusion that jesus influence was a sole result of the roman sack of jerusalem in 70ad he was 30+ years gone by this time it strains the bounds of credulity to assert that nothing about jesus life was noteworthy _until_ the sack i must go these are but a few of my thoughts on christianity christianity is having a relationship with jesus christ himself what do you know of him we read the world wrong phil buckland and say that it deceives us psb eece.ksu.edu tagore from stray birds psb matt.ksu.ksu.edu

fellow-netters and fellow christians about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches to a bible study group alltough i do have a personal opinion on this issue i thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations my background member of a orthodox reformed church let us say a little the only unity i 've found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples i came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything into practice from those messages since becoming a disciple i've found that when i travel to another church in the same movement they are just as accepting there as any other we had a retreat back in january when some of the congregation from louisville ky came up this retreat was for college students and it was as though i had known even the people from louisville for years and i had only become a disciple the previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky one of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice that is only one area in which disciples stand out from `` christians '' also another part of unity is a common depth of conviction i 've also been a part of some `` christian '' campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved a lack of conviction about everything they believed that was why they could be unified they did n't care about the truth but delighted in getting along together the problem here in the netherlands is that there are two other churches denominations with the same characteristics both have the same confessions there are only some differences with respect to for example the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to `` use '' our creeds in essence a lot of people of these three churches have to same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that is the question creeds what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly better so here is a first question can the congregation of christ be separated by walls of different denominations or is this definitely an untolerable situation according to the scriptures according to the scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going to be there as per a previous note i mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means there are also differences of opinion and belief however scripture states in the following directives i have no praise for you for your meetings do more harm than good in the first place i hear that when you come together as a church there re divisions among you and to some extent i believe it no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have god 's approval corinthians 11:17-19 how will god show his approval by fruitfulness see acts 2:47 but before that there are these qualities devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for god all having everything in common glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor of the people all these are mentioned in acts 2:42-47 god also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted look at stephen `` a man full of faith and of the holy spirit '' acts 6:5 who was later stoned acts 7:54-60 can one say that only one of these three churches is the true church of jesus christ one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement i have yet to find that but the closest one i 've found is the boston church of christ movement which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected it is also the only one i 've seen which is totally sold out to god a problem closely related to these question is can we cooperate with other christians from these two churches before there is a unity this question is especially important for those who think that only one church can be the `` true one '' as for cooperation that can always occur unity on the other hand may never occur as for those who think about only one church being the '' true one '' i remind them that mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they will not lose their reward as with the boston movement i 've heard numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples of course few people admit that they 've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement i know i have n't maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you for your information we have a lot of organizations here which are founded by people of one specific church and whose members are all members of that church this has been considered as '' correct '' for years only a few years ago people started to discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process some organizations are opening their doors for people from other churches etc i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me a clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively this causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions i would not say at all that this is something `` correct '' for a church/group to do for any reason in one of the churches i attended for example there was an internal clique of people who were on the different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation they rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being `` opened up '' so that they would have to step right back in their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he would 've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down but is still there so i must warn against such division within there 's enough division without thanks for your opinions in advance maarten joe fisher

`` adrian '' -- name changed to protect the guilty -- and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous new york publishing house dear adrian i 'm way behind schedule on my current book again so this reply to your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview i gave and generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you 're free to believe or not i can back with evidence and logic i 've neither time nor energy to present now i 've written fully on this topic before and will again in the future when i do i 'll make sure you get copies there are many arguments i might make from the futility and danger of delegating self-defense to the police see don kates in the jan. wall street journal to the real effect of prohibition shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs but i 'll limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note first the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility second publication of some latter-day `` scientific study '' does n't alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists i discussed in my interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying third the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility fourth as often happens with these things the `` study '' does n't support the gun prohibitionists original numerical contentions anyway but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies omissions and distortions fifth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility sixth the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions carl bakal author of no right to keep and bear arms even confessed to it publicly makes the value of this present `` study '' dubious to say the least seventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility eighth given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction you should be better aware than most people how `` progress '' -- in designing `` studies '' to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data a case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist or years to create `` studies '' `` proving '' that pornography causes crime more naive and probably more honest efforts in the 50s and 60s clearly indicate the contrary ninth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility tenth another reason to doubt all such `` studies '' is that human behavior as the austrian school of economics demonstrates is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified the attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization eleventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility twelfth the `` study '' is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right sometimes with ancillary social benefits if anything perhaps suicide intervention should be a criminal offense thirteenth and finally the national rifle association officials quoted in the article whatever their shortcomings and they are many are correct in this instance the `` study '' is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility and because of that adrian even if the `` study '' were valid it would n't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however whenever and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody 's permission in this i 'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun `` while they still can '' before the '68 gun control act most of the `` shooting fraternity '' viewed handguns incorrectly as it turned out as inaccurate ineffective toys there probably were n't six million of them in the whole country now thanks to kennedy metzenbaum the bradys and their ilk -- america 's greatest sporting goods sales team -- we probably manufacture at least that many every year the fascinating datum is that handgun control et al are perfectly aware of this -- so i guess you 'll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are look gun-making is n't an arcane or difficult art and by the way it 's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic the fact that i can still obtain my own weapon of preference the self-loading pistol is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further even if it were difficult there are already a quarter billion firearms in america with an estimated `` half life '' of years -- possibly more for stainless steel guns are gon na be around a long time adrian whether you like it or not as for me to paraphrase elmer keith regardless of what the law provides or any court decides i 'm always going to be armed and i will always work to see that others are as well the bad news is that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands -- where i come from we ca n't be stopped by passing laws we

admire such honesty guns are made to kill people not to shoot target or to have something more macho than stamps to collect ..... fire an anschutz .22 then come back and talk to us you 're letting ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking either that or this is sour grapes because we beat you in the olympic shooting events funny you 'd think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse it is more easy to kill/injure someone with a gun than with a knife or a bat as in baseball precisely that makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry not everybody has the time to train with a gladius you know but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time to extend this a bit further you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have i 've spent a few years practicing with a sword i can take the common person armed with one though self-defense is n't the reason i own one my kid sister would have an even chance of beating me gun vs. gun with only a month of training that makes firearms much better in our eyes it 's not very wise to compare two completely different countries like usa and let 's say island on issues like crime and violence excellent point perhaps you are n't so naive after all yes the problem is people committing crimes not the tools beeing used but should be taken into concideration taken into consideration in what respect though quite wrong let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general this has been taken into consideration we call use of them aggrivated assault assault with a deadly weapon assault with intent to kill attempted murder and a whole host of others and tack on extra prison time we have a very strict gun-legislation in norway but until recently it was possible for enyone over years to buy a shotgun shotguns are used mainly for hunting in norway ... but because it was so easy to accuire one it was the most used gun in crimes in norway i suspect it was about the only weapon available you conquered your land among others a full millenia before we were thought of and shortly thereafter weapons were n't quite so common i suspect that a few world wars made a difference too since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes i 'm curious though were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime or were they aquired by other means any requirements other than just registering the shotgun and -unbelievable- the use of guns in crime fell ..... there are now a new law against wearing long knives in public and why should it be allowed `` come on down to honest erik 's used swords here 's a slightly-used short sword the battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century only 39.95 with trade-in easy financing '' sorry i could n't resist you guys still slicing each other with long knives or is this really not a problem what i as an scandinavian have problems to understand is that you americans have a more liberal view on guns and violence than on nudity and sex try showing a bare breast on tv insted of violence and murder ... i 'm all for that what gets me is that scandanavians and yes i 'm only a couple generations off the longship used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing maybe you had a bit more time and a more homogeneous culture to become civilized with yes i know a little american history but is it a civil/human right to have an assault gun in your home and/or an handgun in your car yes we 're too damned violent partially i believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and do n't identify ourselves as `` americans '' first and foremost i 'm rather proud of my norwegian and danish heritage whereas i suspect you could n't care less about that welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in ireland back in the time scale and the homogeneous culture are important equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good in america the individual is more important than the masses personal liberties are prized above all this is sadly changing of late but i trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to americans i'd hazard a guess that were america less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere one poor effect of this culture we have is that we 're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population my grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in denmark because she spoke '' low dane '' whereas others spoke `` high dane '' it was shortly after world war ii as i remember that `` low dane '' was abolished so there was one common dialect we can not fathom such a minor thing being a problem because we have even more obvious means of identifying an `` outsider '' the bad english is not my fault it 's probably the keyboard-software or the quality of the subtext on tv ...... take heart

abuse by the goverment this seems to be one of the main problems any harder gun-control would just be abused by the goverment. either some of you are a little paranoid no offence ... mr. parsli i have to take exception at this there are verifiable previous examples of levels of u.s. governments abusing gun-control restrictions i do n't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future after so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove or you should get a new goverment you do have elections i 'd love to but as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents there 's not a lot i can do it 's silly to suggest that if there 's anything we ca n't trust the government to do and therefore the government should be allowed to do it then we should change governments down that road lies total government power i 've never been a fan of totalitarianism guns 'n criminals most weapons used by criminals today are stolen this is very likely known criminals can not buy weapons that 's one of the points of gun control and because gun control are strict in whole scandinavia and most of europe we dont have any problem with smuggled guns the north american continent is not europe no matter how many people would like it to be drugs are very illegal and they're here for years canada has crowed about its gun control if it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent then canada should have always had comparable rates to the u.s. yet they still do n't unless you can tell me why the canadian border is so much more magical than the mexican border which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled then i really ca n't accept that argument mixing weapons and things that can be use as one what i meant was that cars can kill but they are not guns no there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the u.s. two-thirds of which are suicides unfortunately i do n't have suicide rates for norway however this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate the issue i hope .. i think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem guns are not a problem but the way they are used is .... and what are they for i think this discusion is interesting when you think of ex jugoslavia they should all have weapons it 's their rigth to have them and if they use them to kill other innocent people the problem is humans not guns the problem 's been humans since before we had stone axes the fct of the matter is simply this if nobody ever assaulted anybody whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent yet weapons are built i 'd suggest then that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons anyway the bosnians et al have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years taking away their guns even if we could would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality if of all murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem it 's the 'axer an example do n't flame me just because not exactly are killed by guns ... in the u.s. approximately of murders are commited with firearms with handguns with non-handguns the reason i say that guns per se are not the problem is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of europe's countries entire violent crime rate i do n't really think we 've got more knives or fists in any case i think examples of gun control applied to the u.s. have been abkect failures just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition until you deal with why people are doing what they are doing you wo n't solve your problem and if the problem is violent crime you should n't concentrate on the tools instead the vast majority of guns is never ever misused on the order of 99.5 over the entire lifetime of the gun this says to me that you ca n't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse think about the situation in los angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves is this a good situation the situation is not `` good '' in that people fear for their lives but recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots protecting their shops with guns would it have been better they too lost their livelihoods is it the rigth way to deal with the problem the problem of poverty and rage in los angeles no it is n't however if that problem becomes a violent action then yes it can be appropriate whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition wo n't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it you have to examine which problem you 're referring to if you 're discussing someone violently assaulting you then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop hopefully simply letting them know you 're prepared to shoot them would be enough as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners if everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals and their neighbor who have guns what do you think will happen i mean if everybody had a gun in usa of households have some form of firearm usually a long gun that accounts for a level of access for at least million americans firearm ownership is most likely among educated well-off whites the group least likely to be

17, document_id from fcrary ucsu.colorado.edu frank crary subject re the usual in article viking.734084516 ponderous.cc.iastate.edu viking iastate.edu dan sorenson writes yes i am pro-gun and yes i do disagree with this statement nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous radioactive decay of plutonium and uranium as well as the tritium in the weapon tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things can you say `` neutron flux '' can you say `` i get more background radiation from living in denver or having an office in a limestone building than i do standing next to a power reactor at full power or standing next to a nuclear warhead that is armed '' look up `` shielding '' in your dictionary you do n't need six feet of lead to make decent shielding your dead skin cell layer does an excellent job on alpha particles and neutrons are slowed by mere water what do you think of you is but whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the neutron and becoming radioactive itself mostly that means water turning into harmless heavy water but some neutrons would also hit bones and the resulting harmfull secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades i think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard as for a shielded warhead i think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded e.g storage in a dry temperature-regulated facility etc ... for private ownership to be unregulated i think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon but keep it in a safe condition if any random private citizen could not properly keep maintain and store a nuclear weapon then some regulation is clearly appropriate plus these things have no self- defense purposes it 's kinda hard to justify their use as a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use low-yield weapons or at worst for industrial target obliteration translation cities and population centers if the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal government they are indeed useful weapons to the militia i disagree with this purpose the job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community if you look at the american revolution as an example the militias won by seperating themselves from and becoming independent of a repressive government they did n't overthrow it and those communities canada and england for example that did n't defend themselves were still under that same old regime if the role of the militia were offensive to go out and destroy repressive governments nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate but their jobs is defensive and nuclear weapons are n't suited for that there is also the question of personal and collective arms the second amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms but it is n't clear if it covers other arms certainly not all members would supply for example a tank only a few could or if they were to be used effectively should however those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower the militias as the framers envisioned them were extremely democratic if only of the members supported the cause only would respond to a muster and the militia 's firepower would be proportionately reduced militia firepower and the popular will were therefore linked but if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower in the form of heavy weapons this would all change the militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority not of the general public worse that minority would be quite different from the general public at the very least they would be much richer as a result i think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia 's firepower his personal weapons and some equitable fraction of a squad 's heavier firepower frank crary cu boulder

17, document_id from bressler iftccu.ca.boeing.com rick bressler subject re `` proper gun control '' what is proper gun control was re my gun is like my american express card iftccu mikey ccwf.cc.utexas.edu strider 8:51 pm apr i think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun but how the hell are you going to manage that you still have n't offered i 've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now even contributed a few comments but this stuff `` i 'd rather face a knife than a gun '' has got to come from ignorance i used to think pretty much the same thing then i got 'educated people do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be or how quickly you can be killed with one most people do n't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick within a minute or so death the death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck and thus more get injured by knives a gun is deadly only in a single direction and it 's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon a contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area to feet in diameter most people have never seen knife wounds aside from slicing a finger by accident from feet or so a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill from inside feet or so a knife is a match for a drawn gun a knife is utterly silent it never jams and never runs out of ammunition it is limited only by the speed dexterity skill and ability of it 's wielder criminals in general are young fast and strong it 's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices i 've talked to several well trained martial artists they have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut hopefully not as bad as the attacker practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife say a popsicle stick or tooth brush criminals practice their knife attacks in prison if you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat or in the case of an experienced attacker parts of your body falling off onto the ground a year old man with arthritis can close that yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds dennis tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two i 've seen people close that distance and strike in second i 'm old over weight and slow i can do it in 1.3 seconds i 've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe how about a single stab wound to the chest with a table fork in this case the attacker used the handle not the pointed end add to this the 'fact that hand gun 'stopping power is largely a myth except in the case of a central nervous system shot or a round that destroys the skeletal structure it takes anywhere from to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect this is true of even heart shots there is the case of the police woman in l.a. the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart that lady not only killed her attacker but chased him down to do it all four of her shots fired after she had been shot struck the perp atta girl the bullet entered her on a downward angle went through the apex of her heart down through the diaphragm clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen it then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole she died about six times on the operating table but was out of the hospital in days and was back on full duty in eight months she was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest she was on her way home so happened to have her gun no she does n't think civilians should have the same rights sigh the moral of the story is that even if you do manage to shoot a knife attacker you 'd better be planning on doing some dodging a good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis people can often walk a little on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons the target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass and is more reliable to stop somebody with a contact weapon assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job hot .38 's on up will usually do this remember folks the idea is n't to 'take em with you but for you to live and them to fail whatever the consequences for them this the reason 'killing them is n't our goal or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive i do n't want to face a violent attack of any sort knowing what i now know i ca n't rightly say i 'd rather face a knife than an gun it would have to depend on the attacker and if i could pick and choose i would n't be there this is really the bottom line criminals do not fear the law criminals do not fear the weapon they fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes rick

18, document_id from tclock orion.oac.uci.edu tim clock subject re `` conventional proposales '' israel palestinians in article 2bca3dc0.13224 news.service.uci.edu tclock orion.oac.uci.edu tim clock writes the latest israeli `` proposal '' first proposed in february of contains the following assumptions concerning the nature of any `` interim status '' refering to the wb and gaza the palestinians implemented by negotiations it states that israel will remain the existing source of authority until `` final status '' is agreed upon israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the interim self-government arrangements isga the isga will apply to the `` palestinian inhabitants of the territories '' under israeli military administration the arrangements will not have a territorial application nor will they apply to the israeli population of the territories or to the palestinian inhabitants of jerusalem residual powers not delegated under the isga will be reserved by israel israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects- external internal- and for the maintenance of public order the organs of the isga will be of an administrative-functional nature the exercise of powers under the isga will be subject to cooperation and coordination with israel israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education business tourism labor and social welfare local police local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious affairs the palestinian counterproposal of march the establishment of a palestinian interim self-governing authority pisga whose authority is vested by the palestinian people its pisga powers can not be delegated by israel in the interim phase the israeli military government and civil adminis- tration will be abolished and the pisga will asume the powers previous- ly enjoyed by israel there will be no limitations on its pisga powers and responsibilities `` except those which derive from its character as an interim arrangement '' by the time pisga is inaugurated the israeli armed forces will have completed their withdrawal to agreed points along the borders of the occupied palestinian territory opt the opt includes jerusalem the jurisdiction of the pisga shall extend to all of the opt including its land water and air space the pisga shall have legislative powers to enact amend and abrogate laws it will wield executive power withput foreign control it shall determine the nature of its cooperation with any state or international body and shall be empowered to conclude binding coopera- tive agreements free of any control by israel the pisga shall administer justice throughout the opt and will have sole and exclusive jruisdiction it will have a strong police force responsible for security and public order in the opt it can request the assistance of a un peacekeeping force disputes with israel over self-governing arrangements will be settled by a committee composed of representatives of the five permanent members of the un security council the secretary general of the un the pisga jordan egypt syria and israel but perhaps the `` bargaining '' attitude behind these very different visions of the `` interim stage '' is wrong for two reasons the present palestinian and israeli leadership are as moderate as is likely to exist for many years so the present opportunity may be the last for a significant period since these negotiations are not designed to or even attempting to resolve the conflict attention to issues dealing with a desired `` final status '' are mis- placed and potentially destructive given this how should proposals from either side be altered to temper their `` maximalist '' approaches as stated above how can israeli worries and desire for some `` interim control '' be addressed while providing for a very real interim palestinian self-governing entity tim april response by al moore l629159 lmsc5.is.lmsc.lockheed.com basically the problem is that israel may remain or leave the occupied territories it can not do both it can not do neither so far israe continues to propose that they remain the palestinians propose that they leave why should either change their view it is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the israeli presence israel proposes no such reduction .... and in fact may be said to not be negotiating -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- tim there seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed the first is that of israel where there is little trust for arab groups so there is little support for israel giving up tangible assets in exchange for pieces of paper `` expectations '' `` hopes '' etc the second is that of the arab world/palestinians where there is the demand that these `` tangible concessions '' be made by israel without it receiving anything tangible back given this the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by israel of receiving some tangible returns for its expected concessions by `` tangible '' is meant something that provides israel with `` comparable '' protection from the land it is to give up in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine will be accountable and held actively not just `` diplomatically responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory by citizens or `` visitors '' in essence i do not believe that israel objections to palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now if israel was assured that any new palestinian state would be committed to co-existing with israel and held responsible for all attacks on israel from its territory aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above how could such `` guarantees '' be instilled for example how could such `` guarantees '' '' controls '' be added to the palestinian pisga proposals israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go gives lands back to arab states no more `` buffer zone '' gives full autonomy to palestinians any and/or all of the arab parties could and would if not `` controlled '' somehow easily return to the traditional anti-israel position the question then is how to really ensure that that will not happen tim

ignorance the people of turkiye know quite well that greece and the greek cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with greece someday whatever the cost to the parties involved the history speaks for itself greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on july in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of archibishop makarios following the greek cypriot attempt to annex the island to greece with the aid of the greek army turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island turkish cypriots for those turkish cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since the release of nikos sampson a member of eoka national organization of cypriot fighters and a convicted terrorist shows that the 'enosis mentality continues to survive in greece one should not forget that sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the turks in cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to destroy the island 's independence by annexing it to greece of course the

we thought would be safer altogether we were nine persons we all hid in the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet we waited in fear mrs. ilhan the wife of major doctor was standing in the bath with her three children murat kutsi and hakan in her arms suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open greeks had come in and were combing every corner of the house with their machine gun bullets during these moments i heard voices saying in greek `` you want taksim eh '' and then bullets started flying in the bathroom mrs. ilhan and her three children fell into the bath they were shot at this moment the greeks who broke into the bathroom emptied their guns on us again i heard one of the major 's children moan then i fainted when i came to myself or hours later i saw mrs. ilhan and her three children lying dead in the bath i and the rest of the neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded but what had happened to my wife then i remembered and immediately ran to the toilet where in the doorway i saw her body she was brutally murdered in the street admist the sound of shots i heard voices crying '' help help is there no one to save us '' i became terrified i thought that if the greeks came again and found that i was not dead they would kill me so i ran to the bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed an our passed by in the distance i could still hear shots my mouth was dry so i came out from under the bed and drank some water then i put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the bathroom which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago there i offered sweets to mrs. ayshe her daughter and mrs. novber who were all wounded we waited in the bathroom until o'clock in the morning i thought morning would never come we were all wounded and needed to be taken to hospital finally as we could walk mrs. novber and i went out into the street hoping to find help and walked as far as koshklu chiftlik there we met some people who took us to hospital where we were operated on when i regained my consciousness i said that there were more wounded in the house and they went and brought mrs. ayshe and her daughter after staying three days in the hospital i was sent by plane to ankara for further treatment there i have had four months treatment but still i can not use my arm on my return to cyprus greeks arrested me at the airport all i

from israeli press madness written 4:34 pm apr by cpr igc.apc.org in igc mideast.forum -- -- -- -- -- `` from israeli press madness '' -- -- -- -- -- from the israeli press paper zman tel aviv tel aviv 's time friday local tel aviv's paper affiliated with maariv date february journalist guy ehrlich subject interview with soldiers who served in the duvdevan cherry units which disguise themselves as arabs and operate within the occupied territories excerpts from the article `` a lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as arabs things good and bad some of the falsehoods but the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with it is that everyone who serves in the cherry after a time goes in one way or another insane '' gee i 'd better tell this to the mental health branch of the israeli army medical corps where would we be without you davidson a man who said this who will here be called danny his full name is known to the editors served in the cherry after his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy his pal who will here be called dudu was also serving in the cherry and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour they both look no different from average israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service but in their souls one can notice something completely different .... it was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them and they think that to most of their fellows from the cherry it wound n't be easy either yet after they began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking the following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness ... a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team in which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry we called such soldiers h.i 'hit by the intifada under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop which is a common phenomenon in the cherry i sent him to a psychiatrist but why i should talk about others when i myself feel quite insane on fridays when i come home my parents know i can not be talked to until i go to the beach surf a little calm down and return the keys of my father 's car must be ready for in advance so that i can go there i they dare talk to me before or whenever i don't want them to talk to me i just grab a chair and smash it instantly i know it is my nerve smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home to the car and to the beach only there i become normal. ... ... another friday i was eating a lunch prepared by my mother it was an omelette of sorts she took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me i then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind i told her how i shot an arab and how exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it she began to laugh hysterically i wanted her to cry and she dared laugh straight in my face instead so i told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two arabs who were preparing the molotov cocktails he shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as they deserved one bullet had set a molotov cocktail on fire with the effect that the arab was burning all over just beautifully i was delighted to see it my pal fired three bullets two at the arab with the molotov cocktail and the third at his chum it hit him straight in his ass we both felt that we 'd pulled off something next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look i reached the spot first and then that arab blood gushing forth from his body spits at me i yelled 'shut up and he dared talk back to me in hebrew so i just laughed straight in his face i am usually laughing when i stare at something convulsing right before my eyes then i told him 'all right wait a moment i left him in order to take a look at another wounded arab i asked a soldier if that arab could be saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that i keep telling all this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight into my face this infuriated me i got very angry because i felt i was becoming mad so i stopped eating seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over her head only then she stopped laughing at first she did n't know what to say ... but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently i went with a friend to practice shooting on a field a gull appeared right in the middle of the field my friend shot it at once then we noticed four deer standing high up on the sigh four deer in tel aviv well this is probably as accurate as the rest of this fantasy hill above us my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock we shot down two deer more and went to take a look when we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother we carefully inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit we were just delighted by that sight we had hit'em so good then we decided to kill the young deer too so as spare it further suffering i approached took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in but my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us this made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like beasts of prey we could n't explain what had happened to us we were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we felt the whole day very badly ... we always go back to places we carried out assignments in this is why we can see them when you see a guy you disabled may be for the rest of his life you feel you got power you feel godlike of sorts '' ... both danny and dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation danny feels the exact opposite 'why should n't i take advantage of the skills i have mastered so well why should n't i earn 3.000 for each chopped head i would deliver while being a mercenary in south africa this kind of job suits me perfectly i have no human emotions any more if i get a reasonable salary i will have no problem to board a plane to bosnia in order to fight there '' transl by israel shahak yisrael shahak the crackpot chemist figures i often see him in the rechavia jerusalem post office a

the border into turkey the rest were killed and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain

of the dead '' ohanus appressian `` men are like that '' p. a genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an attempt to exterminate a race this is the worst crime in history it happened to the turks in eastern anatolia and the armenian dictatorship 2.5 million turks and kurds were killed in the worst ways imaginable it is sickening to think that the human race is capable of such actions but there is no denying the fact that the armenian genocide of 2.5 million muslims happened people of turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were killed in the turkish genocide i understand their anger that there are those who still deny that the turkish genocide indeed took place despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million turks has been well documented over

savagely murdering 2.5 million muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the 20th century acted upon

werlag freiburg page during the fifteenth century when the ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the balkans there was considerable turmoil among the jewish communities in central and western europe even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized it is easy to understand the attraction which ottoman life particularly when compared to life in europe held for the jews there is no way to tell how many jews left christendom for the realm of the rising muslim ottomans but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from christian countries it is recorded that some jews fled to ottoman territory the regularity of these reports suggests that the ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of jewish families moving southward and eastward from western and central europe ... it is evident that the effects of plague late crusades and the general intolerance and persecution of jews in christian europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of jewish life which for more than two centuries was to be oriented toward muslim east. page in the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the edirne jewish community was rabbi yitzhak sarfati the ashkenazi chief rabbi of the city he was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the edirne jewry in the fifteenth century sarfati himself was from christian europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there who upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the ottoman jews prevailed upon him to write their european coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate this remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the ottoman domains but described as well the ease of travel to palestine and the holy places an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there. page ... the impression gained from the hebrew sources is that the jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the ottomans especially in comparison to relations with the christians of europe confirmation of the commonality of interests between muslims and jews is also indicated by the fact that european christians perceived the jews as allies of islam and were well aware of muslim-jewish cooperation certainly the activity of important jewish financiers and politicians representing the ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed european sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers in addition it appears that christian pirates plundered `` turks and jews '' their sworn enemies and that europeans considered the jews to be agents who regularly reported to the ottomans there are well-known examples of overt jewish support for the ottomans in the struggle against european powers the two best known instances of jewish support for the campaigning ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the jewish contributions to the conquests of buda in the early sixteenth century and of rhodes we also have reports of sympathy for the ottomans during the siege of chios an unpublished ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some greek towns ... page it is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of jews and muslims coincided frequently and all parties involved jews muslims and christians were aware of the situation. page ... it seems that the relations between greeks and jews were not particularly cordial the two groups had little in common few common interests and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation rather than enmity if there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was that between muslims and jews neither of whom had much in common with the orthodox. page the general impression of muslim-jewish relations in the ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests from the earliest times the ottomans seem to have welcomed jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element the jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of jews from christian countries to ottoman domains. page from the period before we have only a few indications that the ottoman-jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward but the liberality of the ottomans in contrast to the intolerance of the byzantines and the protection and the security which the ottomans offered in comparison to conditions elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the ottomans and the jews recognized their mutual interests ... page it is impossible to say how fundamental the jews were in the success of the ottomans in rebuilding istanbul or in ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century that they played an important role in both can not be doupted it is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the ottomans as well as did the jews it is however unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between jews and the non-jewish society in which they lived we must conclude that the ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the jews did certainly for the jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the ottoman empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home. a version of rabbi sarfati 's tzarfati letter is given by prof.shaw page your cries and sobs reached us we have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the german lands .... i hear the lamentation of my brethren ... the barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people ... the priests and prelates of rome have risen they wish to root out the memory of jacob and erase the name of israel they always devise new persecutions they wish to bring you to the stake ... listen my brethren to the counsel i will give you i too was born in germany and studied torah with the german rabbis i was driven out of my native country and came to the turkish land which is blessed by god and filled with all good things here i found rest and happiness turkey can also become for you the land of peace ... if you who live in germany knew even a tenth of what god has blessed us with in this land you would not consider any difficulties you would set out to come to us ... here in the land of the turks we have nothing to complain of we possess great fortunes much gold and silver in our hands we are not oppressed with heavy taxes and our commerce is free and unhindered rich are the fruits of the earth everything is cheap and every one of us lives in peace and freedom here the jew is not compelled to wear a yellow hat as a badge of shame as is the case in germany where even wealth and great fortune are a curse for a jew because he therewith arouses jealousy among the christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him to rob him of his gold arise my brethren gird up your loins collect your forces and come to us here you will be free of your enemies here you will find rest ... israel

but i feel that i am a bit concerned by the thread since i am a southern lebanese from a village that is often on the receiving end of israel 's bombs in the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied lebanese terrritory is not an act of terrorism or murder it is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder this exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth it seems to me dorin that you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation i will try to paint the most accurate picture i can of what the situation really is in south lebanon in article 1993apr15.152455.14555 unocal.com stssdxb st.unocal.com dorin baru writes is there any israeli a civilian in your opinion now i do not condone myself bombing villages any kind of villages but you claim these are villages with civilians and iraelis claim they are camps filled with terrorists you claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope of finding a terrorist or so if they kill one fine if not too bad civilians die right i am not so sure i am i was back in my home village this last summer for your information we are people not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business some work in the fields some own small shops others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee is that so hard to imagine it is not a `` terrorist camp '' as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc ..... some young men usually aged between to years are members of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians once they are back they announce that they bombed a `` terrorist hideout '' where an year old girl just happened to be we are now accustomed to israeli tactics and we figure that this is the israeli way of telling us that `` if you 're gon na hurt our soldiers you 're gon na pay the price '' we accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers israel 's retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw the people of south lebanon are occupied or shelled by israel on a regular basis we do not want to be occupied if israel insists that the so called `` security zone '' is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land we are not asking for the establishment of a lebanese occupied zone in northern israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by israel so the best policy seems to be the removal of israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a `` buffer zone '' aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called `` security zone '' before the conclusion of the peace talks such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israel 's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon if you ask me those questions i will have no problem answering not with a question as you did no nobody is qualified candidate for murder nothing justifies murder i agree only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing can not be qualified as murder no matter what you say i have the

18, document_id from jamshid cgl.ucsf.edu j. naghizadeh subject pr campaign against iran pbs frontline there have been a number of articles on the pbs frontline program about iranian bomb here is my 0.02 on this and related subjects one is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about iran in recent months these include attempts to implicate iran in the bombing of the new york trade center despite great efforts in this direction they have not succeeded in this they however have indirectly created the impression that iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter public statements by the secretary of state christoffer and other official sources regarding iran being a terrorist and outlaw state and finally the recent broadcast of the frontline program i suspect that this pr campaign against iran will continue and perhaps intensify why this increased pressure on iran a number of factors may have been behind this these include the rise of islamic movements in north-africa and radical hamas movement in the israeli occupied territories this movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily fueled by iran the cause for accelerated pace of this movement is probably the gulf war which sought to return colonial shieks and amirs to their throne in the name of democracy and freedom also the obvious support of algerian military coup against the democratically elected algerian islamic front which clearly exposed the democracy myth a further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news on the slaughter of bosnian moslems possible future implications of this movement in saudi arabia and other us client states and endangerment of the cheap oil sources from this region a need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense expenditures this has become necessary after the demise of soveit union the recent pr campaign against iran however seems to be directed from israel rather than washington there is no fundamental conflict of interest between iran and the us and in my opinion it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations this may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the islamic world and iran -- jamshid

slaughtering the turkish population indiscriminately women children old and young alike innocent muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death or massacred with axes and swords or else shut up

camp '' as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc ..... some young men usually aged between to years are members of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians this a `` tried and true '' method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing `` state '' to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search certainly the people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm 's way are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel should totally back down so ... the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives if israel insists that the so called `` security zone '' is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers your damn right israel insists on some sort of `` demilitarized '' or `` buffer '' zone its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of arab states and watched as the states did nothing it is not exactly surprizing that israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some `` guaratees '' there is no way israel is going to accept their `` word '' not with their past attitude of tolerance towards `` anti-israel guerillas in-residence '' i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled good lord brad what in the world goves you the idea that un troops stop anything they are only stationed in a country because that country allows them in it can ask them to leave at any time as nasser did in '56 and '67 somehow with that `` limitation '' on the troops `` powers '' i don't think that israel is going to be any more comfortable without a genuine commitment to peace from the arab states and concrete not intellectual or political exercises in jargon `` guarantees '' by other parties the un is worthless to israel but perhaps useful as a `` ruse '' this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a `` buffer zone '' aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is the feeling that it is better that `` many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate '' if however you call on israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic groups if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called `` security zone '' before the conclusion of the peace talks such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israel 's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it from israel 's perspective `` concessions '' gets it nothing ... except the realization that it has given `` something '' up and now can only hope that the other side decides to do likewise words can be taken back by merely doing so to `` take back '' tangible items land control of land requires the sort of action you say israel should stay away from israel put up with attacks from arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of lebanon the entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the arab state involved that state promptly ignored the entire matter secure in the knowledge that it could not be held responsible for the acts committed by `` private groups '' israel would prepare for the next round of attacks what would israel want to return to those days and do n't be so idiotic as to suggest `` trust '' for the motivations of present-day arab states there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances ah ok ... what is `` different '' about the present situation that tells us that the arab states will not pursue their past antagonistic policies towards israel now do n't talk about vague `` political factors '' but about those `` tangible '' just like that which israel gave up factors that `` guarantee '' the responsibility of those states your assessment of `` difference '' here is based on a whole lot of assumptions and most states do n't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon basil it has not without the support and active involvement of syria lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one-sided and selectively naive

position to know about any kind of concentration camps akgun living through those days at the age of and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and position in turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time forget about internal news agencies i haven't heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with greek cypriot prisoners in turkey however i heard adana pow camp it was not secret and well recognized pow camp as for all the registered prisoners to the red cross having returned to their homes this is your version of the story there are cases in which prisoners who were registered some of them even sent messages to their relatives were not released these are undeniable facts i see they vanished in turkish labor camps turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing them is that it what do you think happened to them i thought that mia 's are only the subject of rambo and chuck noris movies seems that i am wrong as for their treatment being according to what convention ... okay we believe you you do n't need to belive me turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history it has been a respected and continuous member of un since the inception of un no body ever questioned the un membership of turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by usa to satisfy the internal greek loby i know what you would say next let me answer it before wasting anytime yes un had a few condemning resolutions against turkey because of handling the cyprus problem especially after the coup well us and israel had a few too what can i say i am sure during athens junta duruing 1960-74 greeks had their own share too closed matter today between turkish cypriots/turks/greeks/greek cypriots there is no more any official demand from greek cypriots about any missing greek cypriots where have you heard that there is no official demand regarding the missing persons have you looked at the latest un agenda for cyprus talks mediated by gali there was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties was there i heard many times from denktas interviews by turkish and international press he keeps saying that `` this was no longer an issue for peace talks '' also you do n't want me fish for the greek cypriot politician 's words that argic had posted zillion times describing missing peoples as a greek-cypriot myth seems that there is a different opinions among greek-cypriots as well about missing people in turkish custody .. your claim that the majority of the missing persons were infact killed in the period between the coup d'eta and the invasion days is simply not true all the cases of missing persons i know and i know quite a few are cases of people who were either in the reserve forces and were lost somewhere in the battlefield or were civilians who were taken prisoners in their villages by the turkish army i am not claiming anything i just told you what was given to greek cypriots as an answer by turkish goverment/turkish cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between july and the final cease-fire in late august this answer seems to satisfy the international community the un and the vasilu goverment since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks also i am not aware of any un condemnation against turkey about any missing greek-cypriot are you btw do you mean that nicos sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta and nobody got hurt in those events as of the few photos which you refer to there are more than a few there are photos not only of greek cypriot soldiers being `` rounded up '' but also others in the prison camp in turkey like i said before there is even a different opinion among greek-cypriots for this myth the officers in turkish army who governed the adana pow camp must be hell of clever dudes to cover up their tracks 8- i hope turkish army does't have same type of morons for the security of turkiye however this must a good subject for a movie script one should inform oliver stone about this of course not the justice was served well if and when the bosnian pleas are answered who 's going to dare to ask what happens to those masterminds behind the ethnic cleansing idea they are known today as eoka-b masterminds were known in to everybody and are doing it openly even giving tv interviews it may take same time as it was for the eoka-b case however the justice will be served again akgun comparing the actions of the serbians in bosnian with the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ actions of ^^^^^^^^^^^ turkey in cyprus is not something i would do if i were a turk

an array of representatives of greek political parties including the ruling pasok party and a host of political groups both armenian and non-armenian joined to voice their solidarity with the armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new armenian political force were voiced here on sunday april during the 2nd international meeting of solidarity with the armenian people and judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations at least here in greece the armenian cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world the international meeting of solidarity was sponsored by the greek branch of the armenian popular movement a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of armenians who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia asala the organization has branches in various european and middle eastern countries and the united states although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of asala ... voicing the support of pasok the ruling party in greece to the armenian people was mr. charalambidi michalis a member of the central committee of the party and the greek member of the permanent people 's tribunal ... explaining the goals and aspirations of the armenian popular movement was ara sarkisian significant was the address delivered by mr. bassam abu-salim on behalf of the popular front for the movement 's continued support of the armenians armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause pledging that palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to armenian youth who need training for such a struggle later mr. abu-salim answering a question put to him by this writer affirmed that his organization had always trained armenian members of asala and that this policy will continue `` the doors of our camps are always open to armenian freedom fighters '' he affirmed among the prominent greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of prime minister papandreou who himself holds a post in the greek cabinet two members of the cypriot parliament who had journeyed to athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering representatives of the christian democratic party edik center party two wings of the communist party representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations a number of mayors of greek towns and cities two greek members of the european parliament and other members of the greek parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference also on hand to follow the deliberations was the

front for the liberation of palestine-general command the central committee of the palestinian national liberation movement-fatah the socialist progressive party of lebanon arab socialist labor party the kurdistan democratic union of iraq and numerous other international groups all noted for their radical stand in the israeli- palestinian conflict support from arf-rm among messages received from armenian groups was the armenian revolutionary federation-revolutionary movement the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers the message clearly gave its support to the armenian popular movement pledging that the revolutionary movement will continue to `` reveal the realities no matter how bitter or tragic they are '' to expose the anti-armenian activities of the leaders of the dashnag `` bureau '' the message was taken as an indication of the link loose as it may be that exists between the dissident dashnag group and the armenian popular movement open supporters of asala and armed struggle the armenian popular movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the greek capital

mr.davidian .. it has pages .. any question .. well it seems your book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the n crap posted by mr. o boy please can you tell us why those quotes are `` crap '' .. because you do not like them ... because they really exist ... why as i said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source given by serdar argic .. you could n't reject it ... in addition the author 's preface was written on january but the book was published in here we go again .. in the book i have both the front page and the author 's preface give the same year and january respectively anyone can check it at her/his library if not i can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct i really do n't care what year it was first published or what i care about is what the book writes about murders tortures et .. in the given quotes by serdar argic and your denial of these quotes .. and your groundless accussations etc ... dd i can provide .gif postings if required to verify my claim vd what is new i will post a .gif file but i am not going go through the effort to show there is some turkish modified re-publication of the book like last time i claim i have a book in my hand published in first publication and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in serdar argic 's reference has .. you could n't reject it .. but now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting around .. let 's see how you lie .. from 'non-existing quotes to re-publication first you said there was no such a quote in the given reference .. you called serdar argic a liar .. i said to you no mr.davidian there exactly existed such a quote ... i even gave the call number page numbers .. you could't reject it and now you are lying again and talking about `` modified re-published book '' without any proof how when where by whom etc .. .. by the way how is it possible to re-publish the book in if it was first published in your claim .i am sure that you have some 'pretty well suited theories as usual and i am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and mr.davidian 's lies ... i also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use which are 949.6 r and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and it is not possible that 's text has pages mine has and yours has now are you claiming that there ca n't be such a reference by saying `` it is not possible ... '' .. if not what is your point differences in the number of pages mine was published in .. serdar argic 's was in .. no need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publications etc etc .. does it give you an idea the issue was not the number of pages the book has .. or the year first published .. and you tried to hide the whole point .. the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed tortured etc by armenians .. and those quotes given by serdar argic exist it was the issue wasn't-it you were not able to object it ... does it bother you anyway you name all these tortures and murders by armenians as a `` crap '' .. people who think like you are among the main reasons why the world still has so many `` craps '' in the any question serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination ohanus appressian 'in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul sahak melkonian

19, document_id from clinton-hq campaign92.org clinton/gore '92 subject clinton background briefing in vancouver 4.4.93 the white house office of the press secretary vancouver british columbia ______________________________________________________________ background briefing by senior administration officials april canada place vancouver british columbia 9:40 a.m. pst folks we 're about to start the background briefing on the aid package senior administration official good morning the president -- president clinton and president yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of american initiatives to support economic and political reform in russia and it 's valued at 1.6 billion before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package i want to make a few points first this is the maximum that the clinton administration can do with available funds to support russian reform all of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the congress there is no need for the administration to go back to the congress to fund any of these programs all our fiscal year '93 funds currently are available so in effect all of these programs can begin tomorrow the second point is that this package is designed to support russian reformers all of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the russian government third the president is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year the package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform in designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you fourth i 'd like to note the special importance of trade and investment i think it 's fair to say that russia 's capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars no collection of governments can meet those needs only the private sector can do so and so the president and president yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship they also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed headed on the u.s. side by vice president gore on the russian side by prime minister chernomyrdin and the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship if it would be helpful i 'd be prepared to run down the first page which is a summary of u.s. assistance and just give you some general background on what these programs are i 'll do it quickly and then i 'll be glad to take questions the first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance this is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the russian government can assure there 's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities that 's million in grant -- that is from food for progress the grant portion of food for progress we 'll also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies and that 's million the second item is concessional food sales as you know the united states has had a long-term grain relationship with russia it 's important to us and it 's important to russia that we continue that relationship the president has chosen the food for progress program which is a concessional loan program the value over the next seven months is million these are concessional terms the exact terms have not been worked out but i think it 's fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal the third program is a collection of private sector support we think this is one of the most important things we 're going to do privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in moscow and so the president has decided to create a russian-american enterprise fund capitalized this year at million and the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in russia to take equity positions in those businesses the president has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis he has also agreed -- the president has also agreed to establish a eurasia foundation this would be a private foundation led by prominent americans to fund democratization projects in russia the fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself i think it 's fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in russia you see that we have a total of million in programs various programs the detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that we 're launching the president is also calling for the development of a democracy corps which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the united states to support reform in russia the fifth program you see is russian office of resettlement this is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration this is a demonstration project what we 'd like to do is work with the russian military to help resettle russian officers returning from the baltic states and other parts of the former soviet union we want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that whether it 's with russian labor and russian materials or using prefab american construction and so we 've decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of housing units we 'll be working very closely with the russian military on this and i would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project the sixth area is energy in the environment they are two issues that the president feels strongly about our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production both oil and gas and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems which cause so much environmental damage i 've talked a little bit about trade and investment about the new group being created that the vice president will chair on our side secretary ron brown will also be cochairing with deputy prime minister shohkin a business development committee which will work in all other sectors of the economy to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment we are also going to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the american government to work on this problem full-time and the point i 'd like to make here is trade and investment in the 1990s is every bit as important to draw an analogy as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s and we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- senior people on a full-time basis because it is terribly important you 'll notice that the united states is going to support russia 's membership in the gatt russia has had observer status russia has requested our support and in fact requested our advice in becoming a member of the gatt we think that the long-term goal of drawing russia into the global economy is paramount a very important goal and that is why we are supporting the membership in the gatt we are also supporting their access to gsp the generalized system of preferences you 'll note that ex-im has extended million in credit for a caterpillar deal in siberia that opic has extended million in credits and loan guarantees for a conoco oil project i 'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between russia and the united states for a 2-billion framework facility through the ex-im bank that would finance russian purchases of american oil and gas equipment and services we think this is a very important development we think we 'll get there by april 14th which is the opening day of the tokyo conference the g-7 conference before i take any further questions i 'd like to defer to my colleague who will review the security assistance objectives with you senior administration official our major unfinished agenda with the russians and with their counterparts in ukraine kazakhstan and belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the start i and start ii agreements recently we completed in moscow three i think very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of nunn-lugar funding to three important programs the first is the program of million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program that is for submarines for icbm dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement -- million the second is a million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled this will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility and finally a 10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system so we add that 215-million total to the extant nunn-lugar assistance which has been flowing -- about million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the russians over the last couple of years so this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the russians but with the ukrainians kazhaks and belarussians belarus for example has just in the last couple of weeks received up to million in fy'93 funds for safety security and dismantlement programs on belarussian territory and this was in the wake of their ratification of start i an agreement to accede to npt so we are working very hard with all the parties to the lisbon protocols and will continue to work very hard with them and i look upon these three recent agreements with russia as a very important step in that process q the opic funds to -- is that for the field in kazhakstan -- and conoco already signed this deal with kazhakstan why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it 's the same one why do you feel it 's necessary senior administration official it 's not the same deal chevron signed a deal with kazhakstan the tenges oil field this is a new investment project it 's a polar lights oil development and renovation project and it 's being announced today so it 's completely new q can you tell us more about what 's involved senior administration official yes conoco like other american oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things one to prospect for new oil in siberia west siberia and two to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines both oil and gas in russia the objective here obviously is to take advantage of the natural resources in russia increase energy production which will in turn increase hard currency revenues which is what russia needs so we think this deal is very very good development for russia the russians do as well and it 's good for an american company and the american government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in opic and through the loan guarantee q so it 's to search and also to renovate fields that are already there senior administration official that 's right q on that point should other american companies expect to get administration support for such deals or should they now go to the ex-im and try to get the money out of the billion senior administration official well as you know ex-im is part of the u.s. government and various parts of the u.s. government have been pushing including the state department and the white house for this deal to be consummated and we think it will and if we arrive at this agreement by april 14th there will be billion in financing available for american companies to sell their equipment and sell their services q that should take up all of the rest of the deals and their wo n't be -- and their will or there wo n't be support for opic sort of deals such as this conoco senior administration official there 's a tremendous amount of interest on the part of american oil and gas companies to invest in russia we think that the ex-im oil and gas facility the 2-billion facility once it is concluded will soak up a lot of that interest but i think the interest may even extend beyond that and if so the government will respond q what 's the current year budget costs of that 2-billion agreement should it go forward and is there any current year budget costs -- senior administration official i 'll have to refer you to ex-im for that i do n't know the details of that q the concessional food sales -- is there any current year costs to that or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due senior administration official the concessional food sales are from food for progress which is a usda program usda has the funds we do n't need to go back to the congress to expend those funds there will be a hit in the budget i 'd refer you to usda and omb for the details on that q can you talk about the democracy corps q and the private sector -- how many folks are going to be involved in that senior administration official why do n't i start with the democracy corps first i think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization private organizations in the united states that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in russia helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis and there were literally or u.s. government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area and so the administration felt -- the president felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts and so this is a presidential initiative it will be headed by ambassador tom simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for u.s. assistance in the former soviet union and we 're very hopeful that we might use this democracy corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government but the resources of the american private sector and schools and communities across the nation q any kind of commitment yet any kind of word yet on fy'94 and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the million the president talked about senior administration official the administration is requesting additional funds in fy'94 of million what the president has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with president yeltsin about additional measures the united states could take in some of these areas to support reform he 'll be consulting with the congress when he returns to washington he 'll be consulting also with the other ally governments and we 'll make a decision at that time q two questions about the billion agricultural money first of all i thought it was the sort of consensus that what russia did not need was more loans for food so why did you decide to do it that way secondly could you explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of russia 's inability to pay how does this fit into that situation senior administration official as you know the united states for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities agricultural products to russia i think between and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history here -- about 5.5 billion in credits credit guarantees through the commodity credit corporation that was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of american grain products on december of last year '92 the russian government stopped its payments on that program they are now in arrears to us on that program and therefore by law the united states can not continue that program and so the president working with secretary espy and other officials in the cabinet looked for other ways that we could promote american grain sales and i think we have two ways to do that we 've announced today million in grant food assistance through the food for progress program but we do not have sufficient authority to spend million in grant food and so we looked for a concessional loan program i think everybody agrees that russia -- that a short-term loan program for russia would not make sense now but a long-term concessional loan program would and that is what this program is it will provide once the final details are worked out for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of principal and then from years seven through which is the life of the deal it will provide for concessional rates of interest -- generally around three to four percent and so we believe and the russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years but it will also continue this very important grain relationship which is important for them and it 's important for the american farm community q i gather from what you say that this could make it explicit -- the russians failure to pay the interest on ecc loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through is that right senior administration official let me be explicit about that we are prevented under the law to from continuing the commodity credit corporation short-term credit program because of russia 's arrearages to the united states all of you know about those arrearages they total about i think around million usda can give you an exact figure so having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve american market share and a long-term grain relationship wanting to respond to a specific request from the russian government for major food assistance knowing that we could n't take it from the grant programs because we do n't have sufficient authority there we looked at food for progress which is a program we 've used to great effect in other parts of the world and we consulted with the russian government and arrived at this solution i think the russians are pleased because it provides them with the food but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short-term payments q where do those funds actually come from senior administration official they come from the food for progress program which is a program under usda 's authority usda has the authority to spend these funds we do not need to go back to the congress for these funds and i want to make that general point again everything in this package the 1.6 billion package comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the congress the administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow and it 's very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year that we meet these commitments and we are confident we 'll be able to do so q how did you arrive at the figure of million -- does that max out that program or did you actually have a range from to -- senior administration official there 's a reason for it the reason was that the russian government told us that 's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time and so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn at which time russia wo n't require the same level of food imports from the west q i would imagine there 's going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with russia have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the ukraine with georgia with some of the other republics senior administration official yes we 're very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending american support to the other countries of the former soviet union we have told ourselves and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance the grant technical assistance that you see roughly percent of the funding will go to russia and roughly percent to the other countries in the area of food sales we have been active with ukraine in grant food assistance with georgia and armenia we will continue that and i think it 's fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and they 're hard-hitting q has anything happened at the summit to lead american energy companies and other companies to believe that russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of taxing legalities bureaucracy senior administration official well one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight not only the economic agenda but also trade and investment and i 'd like to refer to the point i made at the beginning we 're convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to support russia long-term -- we 're convinced that no collection of western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform that only the private sector can do that we look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector it is a very good match with what the russians need now which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production that 's what the russian government has told us it wants to do and so that 's why we have made such a major emphasis on it that 's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks and in fact figured prominently last night in the meeting between president yeltsin and president clinton and we 're hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the american business community that we support their efforts to invest in russia that the united states through ex- im and opec and the department of commerce will be there to support them q my question is is yeltsin in any position to deliver on making russia a more -- senior administration official we think he is i would note that president yeltsin 's prime minister mr. chernomyrdin worked for years in the russian oil and gas sector he will now chair a high-level commission with the vice president vice president gore to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to western investment in the oil and gas sector we believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee and we 're looking forward to the work q what type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program and will the u.s. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the russian government for distribution at their will senior administration official are you talking about the variety of programs listed here it depends on the program itself in most cases though we are either working through american pbos or american government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent that the money gets to the intended source that 's an obligation we have to the congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money we have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs but they are all quite different for instance in the area of grant food and medical assistance for grant food it is carried out through usda and usda accounts for the delivery of the food for grant medical assistance we 've been working through project hope which is a private organization for the housing -- for instance the resettlement of russian officers we 'll be working with a group of american pbos on some of the democratization projects we 're working directly with russian private individuals and private foundations we 're working with journalists in russia on a media project that you may have noticed so we literally have here to different activities under all these rubrics and they 're all going to be carried out in slightly different ways some directly with the russian government some with russian citizens q the jackson-vanik restrictions that remain and on the cocom restrictions that remain can you tell us what the president has to do on that senior administration official well as george noted yesterday president yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship the president has noted that i think it 's fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to washington and look at both of these questions and we 'll get back to the russian government q you were not prepared for these questions when you got here senior administration official we were prepared for these questions we 've looked at them but we 're not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend they require -- let me just explain particularly on jackson-vanik they require consultation with the congress they require consultation with the american jewish community and we 're very sensitive to those concerns and so we 'll want to go back and talk to them before we take any action q is this package designed so that you will not have to go to congress for anything at this point senior administration official as i said at the beginning the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the congress so the administration will not have to go back to the congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts in effect they can all begin tomorrow and i know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow and that 's the advantage of this particular initiative q if this as the president says is a long-term long-haul thing and members of congress are at this moment heading for moscow why are n't you talking about going to congress and suggesting to the president of russia that you are prepared to go to congress for various things senior administration official i think we 've been clear about that the president is discussing this weekend with president yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for american funding of additional projects and ideas that he has we have a major congressional delegation that left last night headed by representative gephardt and we 'll want to consult with that delegation and other members of congress before doing anything and we 'll also want to consult with our allies so that 's where it stands now q we 've been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be senior administration official i think that we 've said that these are all projects that either congress had allocated money for through the freedom support act there were some funds that were left over from fy'92 and this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended we did n't use just the freedom support act funds or the fy'92 funds we went into some of the agency allocations -- ex-im opic and usda -- and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs and example of that is the food for progress concessional loans we had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through usda we could not go forward legally and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued american market share and ensure continued grain sales and we think we found it q where for example are you getting the money for this russian officer resettlement -- senior administration official that 's from the freedom support act funds q in other words all of the money is being directly spent in new ways so to speak -- senior administration official most of the grant projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart the second chart it 's broken down into grant and credits and if you look under grants the technical cooperation projects that total 281.9 million -- that is almost all freedom support act funding a little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year '92 the nunn-lugar funds of course you know about the legislative history of those funds q cooperation -- senior administration official from fy '92 i do n't have the exact figure it was not a considerable figure q could you tell us please has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between ukraine and russia over start -- for start i and ii as a result of what 's happened here -- senior administration official both presidents president yeltsin and president clinton will be discussing this issue this morning in fact we have n't yet gotten to security and arms control related issues that will be this morning 's session i know that president clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us we 've been talking to the russians and the ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them up to this point this has been a very important negotiation that 's been going on essentially between moscow and kiev and we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion help to move things forward essentially but in terms of what is coming out of this weekend i do n't yet know in a couple hours we 'll know q just a follow-up on the financing here is any of this robbing peter to pay boris -- since it 's all current year appropriations have you taken it from anyplace that 's been earmarked and put it into this fund senior administration official there are smoke and mirrors here and i think it 's an important point to note we could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out-year funding we 're going to make a long-term commitment to many of these projects -- for instance the enterprise funds the privatization effort the housing effort and we 've already talked to the russians about our long-term commitment we could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package but we wanted to make a point this package is fy '93 it 's funds that we have and we 're going to do what we say we 're going to do and the president feels very strongly about that in the past there is a legacy that the western governments the combination of governments put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we 're not able to meet them we 're determined and the president is determined to carry out every single program in this package and we 'll do it but we do have a longer-term commitment and that 's part of the discussions on economics this weekend we 're looking for russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform and we 've told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year q taken it way from any -- senior administration official no we have n't okay the question is have we reprogrammed any of these funds so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in russia the answer is no we have not done so q in terms of funding there is no available monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else does n't that in fact support the -- theory senior administration official not at all i do n't think it does that 's a particular example and the example is grain sales the commodity credit corporation credit guarantee program was short-term loans that russia had to pay back within to months you all know about russia 's debt problem and russia was unable to meet those commitments so we looked for a way to do two things to meet russia 's requirement for grain they 're a net grain importer on a massive scale and also meet our objective of making sure that the american farmers have a chance to sell their products to russia and we simply look for another way to finance that and we have legislative authority to do it this program has been successful in other areas we had not tried it before in the former soviet union but we thought we should now q is n't this really the bush-clinton aid package for russia since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by president bush senior administration official no i do n't think that 's a fair characterization a lot of these funds were appropriated by the u.s. congress is in this administration took office and inherited some obligations that the bush administration had made but we had a long six to seven week review of this program we decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration but we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund which was just an idea but the idea had not been filled out with a program there was no number attached to it in grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort i would say is another clinton initiative further we listened to the russian government and listened to the russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons and president clinton has responded to that and we are making a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project we 're going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers i would also say that the president has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the russian experience and in calling for the creation of a democracy corps which is another new initiative we 're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the american government to achieve that objective so i would not characterize it that way at all and as most of you know i am a career civil servant i was in the last administration i 'm very familiar with what the last administration did and i would characterize this as a clinton assistance package for russia q there 's been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because it 's being administered by the russian government senior administration official i think that -- i know that the president and other senior officials of our government are concerned that american money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that it 's intended -- for which it 's intended and so we 're going to take great care -- aid and the state department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that they 're reaching their source i would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the russian government some of these projects especially in democratization and exchanges are going to be worked out directly with russian private individuals with businesses the private enterprise support is another example of that senior administration official if i could just add a word on this point with regard to the ssd-related programs one area that we 've been looking at very very closely is consideration of actually using russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs they would be working very closely of course with the american firms who would be the prime contractors but this is a fine example i think of a more -- of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level down to the ground in russia but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended q when would the democracy corps start exactly when do you see this happening how would get it off the ground senior administration official well the president is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps i think it 's fair to say that we 're going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks ambassador simons takes up his duties on may 1st but in effect we 've already started because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in russia and we 've said that we will be helpful we 've also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government we do have or agencies that are active in russia in one way or another we think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts q excuse me how much of this 1.6 billion will actually be spent in the united states by american made goods senior administration official i do n't have any figures for you now but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that q this figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions or have we just been that far off the mark senior administration official no i think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark and i 'm sorry to say that no this package -- president clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package and he was briefed intensively on this he contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package he contributed a lot of the ideas in the package and i think it 's fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago we have been refining it ever since we spent a couple of days last week going over it with the russian government both the embassy in washington and the government in moscow through our own embassy and so it 's been evolving but this particular package has been together for about two weeks q where is yeltsin 's input into this then there was so much talk before about the president wanted to get yeltsin 's views about specifically what was needed and so forth is that in the out years senior administration official no it 's both president yeltsin has on several occasions told us for instance that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him that the resettlement of russian military officers is important and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them and so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package we listened to him on the privatization effort we have been working with the russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details so the russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way but let me get at the other part of your question the president is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake and we 're looking for his ideas the president has brought his own ideas to the table -- for instance on energy and the environment and in housing but we 're looking for russian ideas not we need to consult with the congress and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active q there 's essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with senior administration official this particular package as i said was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago we have since then consulted with the russian government on the final stages of its development and so this weekend we 've primarily talked about future about what more the united states and other western countries can do to support reform in russia which is our base objective here q i noticed that you -- that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization senior administration official you 're right we have a program to train russian -- young russians in banking and financial services in the united states part of the housing initiative it 's not just to build housing units it 's to retrain russian officers who are retiring into other professions q money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization -- senior administration official we have not yet allocated any money for that q why not q of the million is going to build housing units is n't that a lot of money per unit given what the western dollar will buy in the former soviet union senior administration official if you want to do housing the right way it 's not just the building the framework of a house you 've got to think about all the utilities you 've got to think about the purchase of land you 've got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth and it 's also retraining it 's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming out of -- riga or tallin or vilnius in a house in western russia we think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well this is responding to a request from the russian government q of the million will go to retrain -- senior administration official that 's right q are you talking about apartment buildings or single -- senior administration official we 're talking about single individual dwellings q you 're saying that only families will be served by this senior administration official what i want to -- i thought i pointed out earlier this is a demonstration project what we did n't want to do -- given the experience that the germans and the turks and the italians have had in building housing in western russian we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money what we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with american organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done i noted that we have a long-term commitment to that and so i would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future but we want to do it wisely we want to spend the money wisely q what is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect russia 's reforms and that russia will be in a position to may back the money they 're supposed to pay back especially considering their other debt problem senior administration official well look i think it 's important to note that the united states on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of russian reform it 's got to be a collective western effort and we 're looking to our allies to do more as well but beyond that it 's really what the russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform we can simply play a role and we feel we have an obligation to do so which is consistent with our national interests q did the president say that the value of the u.s. contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the united states so what is it about this program that does this senior administration official i think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward russia and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform we are convinced that if reformers stay in power then we 'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction which are the three benefits to the united states from reform in russia so it 's not a simple question you ca n't just say that this program is the answer it 's a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it q and then on the question of russia 's ability to repay what convinces you they 'll be able to pay seven to years from now senior administration official well the russian government has made a commitment to repay and what we 're hoping is that if reform continues and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues that russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans q substantial government-to-government loan we 've ever gotten into with the russians senior administration official i do n't want to answer authoritatively on that i do n't go back or years on this but in the last four or five years yes it is because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans this is a different type of effort q government loans in any other sector that you recall i know it was n't done in -- senior administration official i think it 's fair to say this is a new and unique effort end10:25 a.m. pdt

ns.encore.com roger collins writes julie eddie.jpl.nasa.gov julie kangas writes do n't look at me i want to send aid to russia many other conservatives do as well yes it was nixon who was most vocal about giving money to russia it makes me proud to be a libertarian it appears both conservatives and liberals prefer to cold war until you win then nurse the enemy back to health for another go around enemy sounds like that 's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked conservative -- 'always been commies always will be ok i should have said `` former '' enemy i was being sarcastic about what interventionists want to do i suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti-west slogans coming from his opponents in the russian congress i sure know who i want to back could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a gun have you considered a non-interventionist policy if market reform does happen russia will certainly get private capital at private risk to help their economy they will even have incentive to do so for the same reason if they do n't reform then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them then their 's the ideological point we want to `` win '' russia over to our type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit over everyone 's finances it 's like subsidizing the wealthy countries japan germany etc with free defense and then trade-warring with them because of the economic competition it 's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke better to let them degenerate into civil war remember all those nuclear weapons in russia i can not imagine that they would not be used in a civil war if nationialists take over and even if they prevent a civil war most feel they must take back large parts of land that are in other countries like ukraine i also can not imagine ukraine giving up land without a fight possibly nuclear how does this affect us well we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of europe are blown away i think we 'd feel something a massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is bound to have affects here of course there is also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies or struggling democracies if a 1.6 billion gift was that important to our well being could n't it be raised voluntarilly people already give over billion a year to charity i ask myself what law could we pass to prevent government from doing stupid frivilous things with our money then i think the constitution was supposed to do that could someone please tell me what legitimate constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries seriously seriously everyone has different opinions on what is stupid my two `` causes '' are aid to russia and a strong space program someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish that is why we have a republic and not a true democracy instead of gridlock on a massive scale we only have gridlock on a congressional scale it seems instead of gridlock on any scale we have aid to russia expensive space programs national charity that does n't help the poor and probably studies of drunken goldfish i think limited government is more key than how democratic it is btw who is to decide 'stupid this is just like those who want to impose their 'morals on others -- just the sort of thing i thought libertarians were against that was an opinion and libertarians are very big on free speech actually my politics are pretty libertarian except on this one issue and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party it seems that libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim if you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should be very libertarian consider it a compromise how much money would your fellow russia-aiders have to give to russia if those you oppose were n't using the same government machine to steal money from you and your group for causes you do n't support we could do that years ago but not now people have been saying that for hundreds of years like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and global decision making all the more reason to depend on the free market which can more efficiently process information than to depend on rulers for decisions on complex issues

19, document_id from julie eddie.jpl.nasa.gov julie kangas subject re top ten reasons not to aid russians in article c51qr5.duu encore.com rcollins encore.com roger collins writes julie eddie.jpl.nasa.gov julie kangas writes i suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti-west slogans coming from his opponents in the russian congress i sure know who i want to back could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a gun if we had backed him strongly early on i doubt there would be the problem there is now many russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt rightly imo that the west did n't care yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid once bush got over his gorby-mania this probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections well the aid did n't come through and we did n't make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding have you considered a non-interventionist policy if market reform does happen russia will certainly get private capital at private risk to help their economy they will even have incentive to do so for the same reason if they do n't reform then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them if they do n't reform i do n't believe in giving them money however i think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach this is what really bugs me about libertarianism -- it sounds like 'it 'll all be the same in a hundred years time no need to do anything how does this affect us well we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of europe are blown away i think we 'd feel something a massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is bound to have affects here of course there is also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies or struggling democracies if a 1.6 billion gift was that important to our well being could n't it be raised voluntarilly people already give over billion a year to charity despite the wishes of libertarians this society is a far way and getting farther from being libertarian perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it we have to face the problem now not in x years when we have a libertarian dream society right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade let alone charity there are still limitations to high-tech exports nasa ca n't buy proton launch vehicles from them sure the market may be able to help a great deal but it ca n't right now there are too many obstacles instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face seriously everyone has different opinions on what is stupid my two `` causes '' are aid to russia and a strong space program someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish that is why we have a republic and not a true democracy instead of gridlock on a massive scale we only have gridlock on a congressional scale it seems instead of gridlock on any scale we have aid to russia expensive space programs national charity that does n't help the poor and probably studies of drunken goldfish i think limited government is more key than how democratic it is well i think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited but the main question is how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours btw sometimes it seems that our government is trying to go the opposite direction it is not going to be painless and not going to be easy we simply can not wait to help when they have the 'proper government they 'll never get there without the aid it may be too late already btw who is to decide 'stupid this is just like those who want to impose their 'morals on others -- just the sort of thing i thought libertarians were against that was an opinion and libertarians are very big on free speech and i 'm just excercising mine actually my politics are pretty libertarian except on this one issue and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party it seems that libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim if you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should be very libertarian consider it a compromise how much money would your fellow russia-aiders have to give to russia if those you oppose were n't using the same government machine to steal money from you and your group for causes you do n't support as i also said above another problem i have is with transformation a libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight i have seen nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self-sufficient populace we could do that years ago but not now people have been saying that for hundreds of years they did n't have nuclear weapons years ago nor instantaneous communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in less than a day like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and global decision making all the more reason to depend on the free market which can more efficiently process information than to depend on rulers for decisions on complex issues yes depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses rulers do emerge somewhere and they will never represent the opinions of every person on the planet there must be checks and balances checks on the government when it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of bounds putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market is to me just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of government julie disclaimer all opinions

election hindenburg 49.6 hitler 30.1 thaelmann 13.2 duesterberg 6.8 in the runoff election in april the results were hindenburg hitler 36.8 thaelmann 10.2 so we can see that hitler personally was supported by only about a third of german voters similarly the nazi party never received more than of the vote in reichstag elections that occurred in july in the november election the nazis lost two million votes and seats down from to out of the in the reichstag comparitively the socialists had and the communists the communists had gained seats and the german national party which had supported the previous government had picked up a million of the nazis lost votes to gain seats up to i think the other large party was the catholic center party i do n't know how many seats they had but i think they were declining and there were numerous other small parties thus the nazi vote was on the decline at the time hitler was appointed chancellor what brought hitler to power was not the demand of the german people for hitler or the nazis to run things but the inability of the other parties to put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government for the country germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition and their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the interests of the majority of the population instead what they had was a number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific objectives in order to combine against the nazis who were out to end the democratic process in fact part of the problem was that some of the other parties with substantial representation like the communists were also out to end the democratic process but with different results in mind and generally did n't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under germany had already had a non-nazi chancellor with a majority coalition for five months while the nazis had been the largest reichstag party and there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the nazis if anything the nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed to get enough support to make hitler president and their popular vote had begun to decline hitler was not hindenburg 's first choice to be chancellor not even his second choice first von papen had been chancellor since june after the november election when the nazis lost seats hindenburg first prevailed on von papen to remain as chancellor but there were intrigues behind his back and support for him was lacking so then hindenburg turned to von schleicher who became chancellor for two months eventually he too was unable to hold together a working coalition of parties to oppose the nazis who refused to participate in any government that was not led by a nazi chancellor some of the nazi leadership particularly gregor strasser who was the man in the party at the time wanted to participate in a coalition government but others knowing the party 's support was waning figured that their best hope to gain power lay in undermining the democratic process nevertheless the country was governed for seven months by chancellors who were not nazis even though the nazis were the largest reichstag party the failure of these men to achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition parties to work together here 's how william shirer puts it in _the rise and fall of the third reich_ the cardinal error of the germans who opposed nazism was their failure to unite against it at the crest of their popular strength in july the national socialists had attained but percent of the vote but the percent of the german people who expressed their opposition to hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm them unless they united however temporarily to stamp it out true the german people supported hitler after he became chancellor but that does n't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him before he was in power the german people were not crying out for hitler to take over no matter how bad economic conditions were the leftist parties socialists/communists probably had more support in total than the nazis hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over

'' if it matters to you then why not define human being and seek some substance you 're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words if she is then why does the mother have the right to kill her when she is in the womb but not after she has passed through the birth canal because a woman has a right to have any object which threatens her health and is within the confines of her body removed the other side of the argument would give rights to the fetus that would not be granted to an adult human if for example you were occupying the body of another for whatever reason or through whatever means the reason and means being irrelevant that other would be able to remove or have you removed if that removal required your demise i see no reason in law that such a removal could not be effected rather than examining a hypothetical thought experiment let us examine a real though rare situation siamese twins if one siamese twin has the other surgically removed knowing that it will cause death and barring some emergency where they will both die anyway it is murder is it have you any support for this assertion furthermore your analogy is completely inapplicable siamese twins have an equal claim to any body parts they have in common try again what establishes this `` equal claim '' beyond your assertion if it is merely a matter of `` which came first '' can not one kill the other since they both have equal claim what if one has more motor control than the other does that establish a `` superior claim '' as others point out one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival again your analogy fails not precedence but possession makes a difference here a woman 's womb is indisputably her own also i see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being was that due to its inconvenience you see the right to life is granted to adult humans in the same sense as it should be to the foetus at some point prior to birth are siamese twins ever separated in the womb or is this right you assert for siamese twins which i do n't even think is true as stated or valid as an analogy one that exists after birth freivald your entire argument here is a failure interesting way of trying to combine two essentially orthogonal concepts the point is that it is murder for one siamese twin to kill the other regardless of their status of physiological dependence or interdependence is it please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling it would be difficult for one siamese twin to kill the other inside the womb and even if it were possible i doubt that a case could be made for premeditation or neglegence note the use of the phrase `` it should be '' in my post you simply assert things without any support your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported try this on for size it is not murder for one siamese twin to kill the other in the womb there we now have equal arguments but the idea is illogical for one siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well the systems are dependent on each other for life i 'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so of course the situation is not a perfect comparison it may well be that one siamese twin deliberately initiates oppression or coersion against the other this is clearly not the case with an unborn child and this last statement from you is a total non sequitur the comparison is far worse than you give it credit for are you going to let this assertion stand on its own also or do you plan on following up with a reasoned argument your argument is from fantasy island your comparison is a total failure as i have demonstrated already and has no basis in reality neither legally nor medically and for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible that of coercion or oppression is ridiculous as i said you give the analogy too little credit for failure on the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real rather than a hypothetical situation then you fly off into siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version as i said before decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they can not both survive and furthermore as i have already said there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal you seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman 's womb when the fetus is born what happens to its claim and by what reason do you assert its claim if a parent has the right to choose to not take responsibility for their own child why are there laws and penalties against child abandonment this last question is irrelevant and something of a non sequitur can you establish some relevance or even some sense for it if at some point an unborn child is a human being the parents clearly have the same responsibilities toward her as any other parents have toward their children again what is the relevance you have established no sense of when that point is you ignore the significant difference between a fetus and a born child the dependence of a born child can be transferred to another party while that of a fetus can not a born child does not live within the body of another human being while a fetus does thereby representing potential and often actual harm to that body as in the case of one of our talk.abortion participants who suffers from epilepsy and to whom pregnancy represents a significant health risk or as in the case of a woman i know who chose to continue her pregnancy but spent her entire pregnancy confined to a wheelchair and suffering great pain from constriction of some nerve and your argument is not an argument against abortion generally but at best an argument against abortion at `` some time during the course of pregnancy '' again a quest for common ground most of the pro-choice people i have spoken to in person none of them pro-abortion activists concede that the child has a right to life at some point that supersedes all of the mother 's rights except that of her own life as is often the case in emotionally charged issues the activists have a very different outlook from the mainstream you have n't answered the question the situations are not analagous the dependence of a born child is not transferred instantaneously it takes time and effort incidentally it is the pro-choice side not me arguing that the government should make it easy for parents to abandon their children to the state again you avoid the question dependence can be transferred and it is not as slow as you seem to think as to the anecdotal evidence of real human tragedy there is ample on both sides i would hate to be in the position of the mother in nyc who has to tell her daughter that she lost her arm in a botched abortion attempt yes and i 'd hate to have been the one to tell dr gunn 's children that he was murdered by a religious `` pro-life '' fanatic please do try to stay relevant the kindest thing i can say about these responses of yours is that i can see you are trying to say something but the result is a mish-mash of negligible value sez you clever comeback i congratulate you on the readiness of your wit in article in decay cbnewsj.cb.att.com dean.kaflowitz writes ground covered in another post deleted if at some point an unborn child is a human being the parents clearly have the same responsibilities toward her as any other parents have toward their children and no parent can be forced to supply bodily resources toward their children even if necessary to save the child 's life as was this to make it painfully clear you are not obligated to donate a kidney to save your child 's life under law again the confusion between action deliberately taking away the life of a child and inaction refusing to run out in front of a bus to save a child what happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not by your standards what is different about the two situations i see i have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you in the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child you ask why a born child can not be abandoned but a fetus can and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake you ca n't have it both ways action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle but you are wrong about the inaction anyway ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was to have a healthy live child a woman does more than hang out eat as she chooses plays volleyball like she always did drinks at parties with her friends etc she behaves very differently and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart but it is far from inactive dean kaflowitz

_________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april press conference by the president with russian press canada place vancouver british columbia 2:46 p.m. pdt q i had two questions for both presidents so you could probably answer for boris too laughter the president i 'll give you my answer then i 'll give you yeltsin 's answer laughter q the first is that this is the meeting of the presidents so the money that 's being promised is government money and naturally it 's going to be distributed through the government but you 've indicated that three-quarters are going to be going to businesses so the question is how the russian businesses themselves are going to be consulted if ever what are the priorities because there are several association of russian businessmen existing already so will they be invited to participate in setting up priorities for investment this is the first and second to you we know that polls public polls in america do not show that americans are very enthusiastic about giving this aid like newsweek polls say that about percent do n't approve it and new york times published that percent support if it just prevents civil war percent if it fosters democratic reform and only percent if it just personally supports yeltsin how are you going to sort of handle this problem that americans themselves are not very enthusiastic thank you q i have a question i 'm sorry -- is there going to be a translation of everything into russian no just the answers just the answers okay the president the answer to the first question is it depends on what kind of aid we 're discussing for example the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be good risks and make the application the privatization fund will be used to support the privatization of existing public enterprises then there are some other general funds in the democracy corps and other things which people in russia will have some influence over the distribution of with regard to your second question let me say that i would think that there would be people in both countries who would not feel too warmly toward simply the american government giving money to the russian government there 's opposition to that in russia and in our country throughout our whole history there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds that is this has nothing to do with russia if you look at the whole history of america any kind of aid program has always been unpopular what i have tried to tell the american people is is this is not an aid program this is an investment program that this is an investment in our future we spent trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments because of the cold war now with a democratic government in russia with the newly independent states the remainder of them working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies going it seems to me very much in our interest to make it possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive for the economy of russia to grow because of the potential for trade and investment there and for us to continue the effort to reduce nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides on our side and on the russian side so i do n't see this as an aid program this is an investment for the united states this is very much in the interest of the united states the things i announced today the second stage of the program which i hope to put together next week in my view are things that are good for my country and for the taxpayers and workers of my country russia is a very great nation that needs some partnership now some common endeavor with other people who share her goals but it would be a great mistake for anyone to view this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue that 's not what it is it 's an investment for america and it 's a wonderful investment like all investments there is some risk but there 's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than the trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier of the cold war q mr. president first of all thank you very much indeed for coming here and talking to us in the memory of the living correspondents this is the first time an american president is doing this to the russian press corps so it 's kind of a very measured breakthrough i have two questions one in your introductory remarks of the other press conference you mentioned in brief that you discussed the start ii and start i issues could you tell us did you reach an agreement with president yeltsin as to what might be done in order to have ukraine join the ratification of start i and the npt regime and my second question is how confident you are that the united states congress would be eager to support you in lifting jackson-vanik and other restrictions inherited from the cold war president clinton first we discussed the issue of ukraine with regard to start i and npt and generally with regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent states all be non-nuclear but also to have the united states develop strong relationships with them we know that one thing that we could do that would increase i think the willingness of the ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium because that would provide not only an important economic opportunity for russia but also for ukraine and it would show some reaching out on our part but we agreed that basically the people who signed off on the lisbon protocol have got to honor what they did and we agreed to continue to press that i myself have spent a good deal of time trying to reassure ukraine 's leaders specifically the president and the foreign minister that i want strong ties with ukraine that the united states very much wants a good relationship with ukraine but that in order to do what we need to do together to strengthen the economy of ukraine and to have the united states be fully supportive the commitment to ratify start i and to join the npt regime is critical what was the second question the president with regard to jackson-vanik and cocom i would make two points first i have agreed with the republican and democratic leaders in the congress that we will as soon as i return have a list of all the legislative and other restrictions some of them are regulatory in nature imposed on relations between the united states and russia that are legacies of the cold war and we will see whether they 're -- how many of them we could agree to do away with right now at least among the leadership of the congress with regard to jackson-vanik i think there will be an openness to change the law if the congress is convinced there are in fact no more refusniks no more people who wish to emigrate who are not being allowed to if the fact is that there is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed to affect then i think that the desire to keep the law will be much less with regard to cocom my guess is and it 's nothing more than a guess that the leadership of congress and indeed my own advisers might prefer to see some sort of phased movement out of the cocom regime but i think they would be willing to begin it in the fairly near future q mr. clinton when i read your speech in annapolis i got the impression that you have a completely different personal -- and i stress that -- personal not political approach towards russia compared to the approach of mr. bush could you formulate in a few words what is the difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the difference between your approach to russia and the approach of mr. bush and who made you -- why did you cite akhmatova in the last part of your speech the president let me say first i do not wish to compare myself with president bush or anyone else i ca n't say what was in his heart about russia i can say that since i was a boy i have been personally fascinated with the history the music and the culture and the literature of russia i have been thrilled by russian music since i was a serious student of music for more than years now i have read major russian novelists and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know as much as i could about your history and i went to the soviet union -- but it was then the soviet union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last presidential campaign that i spent the first week of alone in moscow and did not return again until three days before mr. yeltsin was elected president but all that time i was away i was following events there very closely and hoping for the day when we could be genuine partners so i have always had a personal feeling about russia i remember for example -- a lot of you know i like music very much one of the most moving experiences for me as a musician was when leonard bernstein took the new york philharmonic to moscow and played shostakovich 's fifth symphony to the russians and he played the last movement more rapidly than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically so difficult that is something i followed very closely when it occurred these are things that have always had a big impact on my life and i had just always hoped that someday if i ever had the chance to i could play a role in seeing our two countries become closer partners applause the press thank you end3:06 p.m. pdt

this is dr. beter today is april and this is my audio letter r no it 's now been almost one month since war broke out in the south atlantic on the surface it seems that it 's only a dispute between argentina and great britain over the barren wind-swept falkland islands and south georgia island in reality it 's far more than that the so-called falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation during this month of april fierce naval battles have taken place -- not only in the south atlantic but also in the south pacific up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides but as i say these words the naval war in the southern hemisphere is about to come to the surface beginning today april a total naval and air blockade of the falklands by the royal navy has begun at the same time a counterblockade has been declared by argentina in the same area to be effective a blockade must be imposed over a period of time but the royal navy does not have that much time winter is coming on in the south atlantic and the british supply lines are overextended having come this far her majesty 's navy can not simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from argentina as a result the british will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be there is also another reason why the royal navy now has no choice but to engage the argentine forces in combat that reason my friends is that the royal navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the british fleet only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the british dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses to obtain that cover story the british have no choice but to sail into combat but in doing so they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained in short my friends her majesty 's navy has sailed into a trap the events now unfolding in the south atlantic carry strange ironic echoes of the past for weeks now we 've been hearing countless commentators referring to the british task force as an '' armada '' quote the british of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description the original spanish armada years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history -- and it was none other than the english navy that destroyed the spanish armada the original spanish armada put to sea in during the reign of england 's queen elizabeth i the armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade england they were met by the daring sea dogs of sir francis drake drake and his small fast ships turned the tables on the spanish armada by changing the rules of battle the english fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns and it stayed upwind and out of reach from there the english pounded smashed and shattered the big ships of the mighty armada when it was all over barely half the spanish fleet was left to limp back to port drake's defeat of the spanish armada was a shock to the world it opened the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start its expansion into a truly global empire today years later history seems to have come full circle queen elizabeth ii is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under queen elizabeth i and now the cultures of england and of spain are once again in confrontation once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion but this time the armada is british not spanish four hundred years ago sir francis drake was the hero of the day today the ghost of francis drake is once again on the scene the south atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the drake passage around the southern tip of south america the defeat of the spanish armada four centuries ago broke the back of spain's naval supremacy and now the defeat of the new british armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious royal navy my three special topics for this audio letter are topic -- the military secret of south georgia island topic -- the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic -- the rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war topic -- when the falkland islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot for a century and a half since the islands have been controlled by great britain during that entire time british sovereignty over the falklands has been disputed by argentina there have been countless threats by argentina to seize the islands which it calls the malvinas but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and britain has never even gotten very worried about them the islands are four times as distant from argentina as cuba is from the united states and they are not much of a prize after years of occupancy the falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 british settlers and a lot of sheep in short the remote falkland islands hardly look like something to fight over and yet here we are watching another crisis take place we are watching as war erupts between great britain and argentina the thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at nato's doorstep instead britain is throwing almost everything it's got at argentina -- -aircraft carriers cruisers destroyers submarines assault ships -- you name it luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal nato duty and sent to reinforce the task force the initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over over two-thirds of the entire royal navy has already been deployed to the south atlantic off argentina watching all this a lot of people are asking what 's this fight really all about the most popular answer suggested in the major media is `` oil '' vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between argentina and the falklands but that has been known for nearly years in no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by argentina this month and oil explains even less about the argentine seizure of south georgia island south georgia island is miles east of the falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it and compared to south georgia the falklands are an island paradise south georgia island is covered with rugged mountains treacherous valleys glaciers and semi-permanent snow most of it is uninhabitable on top of all that argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to south georgia island in that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the falklands in the early 1830s the falklands were occupied for a while by argentine colonists in the british expelled them and took over the island for that and other historical reasons argentina argues that the falklands really belong to argentina not britain but no such argument is possible for south georgia island it has always been controlled by britain never by argentina or spain the argentine seizure of south georgia island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms they were well aware ahead of time that far-off south georgia island could not possibly be held for long by seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat as the island was retaken by britain so the question is why did argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia island at all my friends the answers to all these questions are military not political or economic south georgia island possesses an enormous military secret it 's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the island the real reason for the so-called falkland crisis is this secret installation together with two other similar installations which i will describe shortly the secret military complexes have been in existence for many years they are not new what is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the american bolshevik war planners here in washington for the past two months i 've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as i can obtain and verify them the plan calls for nuclear war one to erupt by september of this year it is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called falklands crisis to erupt now what is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war the mutual enemies of the american bolsheviks here -- namely the rockefeller cartel -- and russia 's new rulers in the kremlin are behind the present crisis they are trying to ruin phase of the `` project z '' war plan which i revealed last month that phase is to be world domination by the american bolsheviks after both russia and the united states have been destroyed in nuclear war one as i mentioned last month the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world the american bolshevik military planners here in america are working with other bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war having done that they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused safe and cozy in government war bunkers when the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted the bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries they will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open they will confront the world with the only remaining fresh up-to-date powerful military force on earth and using that military power they will become the undisputed rulers of the world -- that is they plan to do all this and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off nuclear war one in a matter of months the rockefeller cartel and russia 's new anti-bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan last month i mentioned that the bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the rockefellers long ago it has only been about three years since the rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the united states government by the bolsheviks since that time the united states government has been a house divided torn by internal power struggles between rival bolshevik and rockefeller factions but before that the united states had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the four rockefeller brothers in the brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination it was a two-prong strategy half visible and half secret which i first described long ago in audio letter no it was a plan for the united states to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually without repeating all the details the basic idea was grandiose yet simple by deliberately appearing weak the rockefeller-controlled united states would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russia then the secret weapons including superweapons would be unleashed to smash russia and take over the world when they set the grand plan in motion in the rockefeller brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the northern and southern hemispheres both superpowers the united states and the soviet union are located well up in the northern hemisphere so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers -- great britain france red china and india by contrast the strategic targets for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere are relatively few and far between in other words it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a northern hemisphere war in an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war but there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread it was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the northern and southern hemispheres in the northern half of our planet cold air from the north pole works its way southward towards the equator then it works its way back to the north as warm air a mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone but very little of the air changes places the military conclusion my friends is this the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the northern hemisphere for generations to come but if the calculations are right the southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war this was music to the ears of the four rockefeller brothers a quick look at the globe of the world shows why the rockefeller cartel has dominated latin america ever since world war ii as i discussed in my very first monthly audio letter nelson rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on latin america during the war he accomplished this as so-called `` coordinator of hemispheric defense '' for then-president franklin d. roosevelt so that takes care of the south american continent and its natural resources then there is the african continent there too rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of black africa especially south of the equator all this was thanks to the efforts of john d. rockefeller iii as i detailed in audio letter no looking around the globe the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are australia and new zealand thanks to world war ii both were wide open to the rockefellers the rockefeller brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the southern hemisphere for use after the coming war by this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet earth after the northern hemisphere war then as the northern hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust the rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces in this way the third generation rockefeller brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the earth in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after the war some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass for example revolts against rockefeller domination would require troops -- not a blast from the beam weapons on the moon the most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy a minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required -- one based in the south atlantic the other in the south pacific since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the northern hemisphere nuclear war they could not be built in existing shipyards new construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden to hide an entire shipyard is no small task they take up a lot of space on top of that it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built the best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation finally the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely the secret navy might be wiped out the combined requirements for secrecy space and protection against attack were formidable but one day in while all these plans were still in the early stages of development the answer presented itself during a so-called banking trip to sweden david rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port the port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water the entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships the rockefeller brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger more secret better protected version of the swedish hidden port was just what they wanted a survey of candidate sites was then initiated the site survey covered coastal areas throughout the southern hemisphere many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby making the desired level of secrecy impossible finally it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically at last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected in the south pacific extreme southern new zealand was selected this is what i was alluding to in audio letter no three months ago when i called attention to new zealand 's extreme importance in the coming war in order to obtain the necessary space the secret new zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together one is at the extreme southwest tip of south island where the mountain range known as the southern alps comes down virtually to the water 's edge the other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of stewart island which is off the tip of south island the stewart island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as mt anglem the new zealand location met all the requirements ever since world war ii the government of new zealand has been tied even closer to the united states than to great britain the location is far from the equator and the installations are buried deep under mountains protected from nuclear attack they are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks and the new zealand site is well situated to command the entire south pacific in the south atlantic an even more perfect site was found that site my friends is south georgia island it is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic the tall rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island it is controlled by great britain whose government like that of new zealand was willing to cooperate and south georgia island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast the whaling station was some miles away from the secret new installation which was being built but britain took no chances in the whaling station was closed down since that time there have been no inhabitants on south georgia island except for a few dozen alleged antarctic scientists construction of the secret naval facilities -- two in new zealand one on south georgia island -- began in the early 's the techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities such as the norad installation inside cheyenne mountain colorado however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland in this way the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction the cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up when sealed the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is and unlike most large construction projects there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention the man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea once the secret naval facilities were built they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage the fake disarmament of the united states during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task from to one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate rockefeller scheme he was then-secretary of defense robert mcnamara all through the 's mcnamara presided over the public paring back of america 's visible military power this included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards what we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards where it went my friends was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in new zealand and south georgia island the secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the united states as defense secretary caspar weinberger told congress recently it is cheaper to build two ships at a time that is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first this has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques the secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates -- exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines they are all nuclear powered -- nuclear `` subs '' nuclear cruisers nuclear destroyers and yes nuclear aircraft carriers three of them a secret twin was built for the u.s.s nimitz for the u.s.s eisenhower and for the newly-launched u.s.s carl vincent all have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns so called that we constantly hear about in the defense department and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way the ships of the secret american bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels even so the secret naval ships possess one key difference last month i revealed that the so-called `` stealth program '' has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield this technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity a whole new fleet of phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle and my friends all of the secret american bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar stealth-field equipment the stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field after nuclear war one the secret stealth navy of the american bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth it would be perfect for the intended role of world domination the rockefellers set it all in motion long ago my friends but three years ago they lost control of the united states military now it 's the american bolsheviks who are in control and they are bent on war these secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the `` falklands crisis '' topic -- in audio letter r no last month i described '' project z '' the new bolshevik three-phase strategy for nuclear war one an elite group of american bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in washington it 's a plan by which the united states will strike the first nuclear blow followed by all-out thermonuclear war with russia having set off the holocaust the bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers finally after nuclear war one fizzles out in stalemate they plan to leave behind the ashes of the united states and her allies activating phase of their grand strategy they plan to unveil their secret weapons especially their secret naval fleets with these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world the united states as we know it will be dead and gone but in the eyes of the bolsheviks themselves this outcome will constitute victory up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first revealed two months ago is still on track they are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by september of this year time is fast running out the bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war but my friends the bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race they have two deadly enemies both of whom are equally determined to trip up the bolsheviks one enemy of the bolsheviks here is the rockefeller cartel the other enemy is the new anti-bolshevik ruling clique in russia and now these two mutual enemies of the bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways in audio letter no three months ago i reported that a limited new anti-bolshevik coalition was in the works between the rockefeller cartel and the russians the january meeting between haig and gromyko in geneva switzerland was a turning point in the formation of this coalition it is now a reality and is responsible for the so-called `` falkland crisis '' now dominating the headlines it should be emphasized that this new relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russia falls far short of a true alliance they have very major disputes to be settled between them but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy -- the bolsheviks here in america the first priority of the russians and the rockefellers is to slow down the bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war if they can do that time is on the side of the rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which i discussed last summer in audio letter no a slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-bolshevik actions to be implemented the joint rockefeller-russian planners decided by mid-february that military action against the bolsheviks was essential very quickly no other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer the exact details of the `` project z '' war plan are not known to either the rockefellers or the russians but the general outlines are known to be as i described last month it was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine phase of the bolshevik war plan -- that is the bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the southern hemisphere should be attacked and crippled by working together the rockefeller cartel and the russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone the rockefeller group who built and originally controlled these bases provided detailed intelligence about the best way to attack them the russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack it was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the south atlantic and south pacific to be attacked survival intact of either fleet would leave the bolshevik war plan still workable military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the new zealand facilities was out of the question there was no combination of commandos frogmen or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world any attack on the new zealand bases would set off the very war which the rockefellers and russians want to prevent but the situation in the south atlantic was a different matter in a way the greatest asset of south georgia island was also its achilles heel the extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the south georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible the key lay with argentina and her long-standing claims to the falkland islands as i mentioned in topic the rockefeller cartel has dominated all of latin america for decades cartel operatives were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there the historic dispute over the falkland islands was to be used to provide a ruse a military cover to enable the south georgia base to be attacked the argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do as an inducement to cooperate the argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards they were guaranteed that after the shooting was over the falkland islands would remain in argentine hands this guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the royal navy and to bolster the troubled argentine economy it was promised that the rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves with these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards the argentine military junta agreed to the plan on march argentina carried out act in the joint attack plan a group of argentine scrap-metal merchants of all things landed at the abandoned old whaling station on south georgia island supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell while they were at it they also raised the argentine flag over the work-site the british always nervous about south georgia island promptly reacted as expected the british antarctic survey ship `` endurance '' put marines ashore they drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the argentine flag the incident provided the desired excuse for the argentine junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old falklands dispute to a boil from time to time in the past argentina has claimed that south georgia is part of the falklands because it is administered that way by britain that argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy it was nothing new to hear this from argentine leaders so there was no hint of what was really afoot during late march argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the falklands `` nothing new '' thought the british high command argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times it was believed that they were about to do it again but on april argentine forces did the unexpected after many past false alarms this time they actually invaded and seized the islands all argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the falklands themselves but just for good measure the next day a small argentine force also seized far-off south georgia island the force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from argentina 's point of view however the small contingent of royal marines were overpowered and bundled off the island along with a group of alleged scientists that was the moment of payoff in the joint rockefeller-russian attack plan thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine forces a special commando team got onto the island undetected based on the detailed rockefeller information about the base the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the rockefeller members of the team while the russian members concentrated on military defense by late that evening april the military high command in london finally learned what was really taking place the secret south georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible the joint rockefeller-russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside it was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base once the hole was made the next step was obvious the rockefeller-russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole the best guess was that it would be a nerve gas the shock waves that went through the highest levels of the british government on the evening of april can hardly be described my friends the thatcher government like the so-called reagan administration here in america is bolshevik controlled that 's why margaret thatcher always says `` me too '' any time the reagan administration says or does anything against russia both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries and on the evening of april they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep deep trouble immediately the thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the south atlantic haste was the order of the day the drilling on south georgia island was proceeding around the clock the best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks on or about april if help did not reach south georgia by then the secret installation might be doomed the forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle they did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons to open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide on april just two days after south georgia island was seized some naval ships began moving out of british ports the same day lord carrington was sacked as foreign minister he was forced to resign my friends because he had assisted the rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the argentine attack preparations that same day april new zealand the home of the other secret naval fleet broke diplomatic relations with argentina the two hidden new zealand facilities had been placed on `` red alert '' as a precautionary measure all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea several surface ships were already at sea undergoing `` sea trials '' but that still left seven major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier on that busy day of april argentina 's foreign minister costa mendez was at the united nations in new york he was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy costa mendez hurried here to washington to seek reassurances from certain officials he got them for the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while negotiations went on that my friends was only a cover story the royal navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward south georgia island if the task force arrived in time to save the secret base a major battle was likely the official stories about `` slow movement '' of the british armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle if need be the fleet would have several days to retake south georgia island then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the announced schedule in this way the crucial importance of south georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserved it was initially expected that advance elements of the british fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two weeks that would have been soon enough to attack the joint rockefeller-russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed but russian cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan key advance elements of the south georgia attack contingent left ascension island early april two days before it was announced officially shortly after they did so they ran into trouble russian cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on south georgia island the cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation in moments the ship was without any command its communications and radar silenced then a russian `` sub '' closed in and quickly finished off this key british ship with torpedoes it broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly so far as is known there were no survivors this unexpected shock in the mid-atlantic produced two results both important first it caused a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic by the british armada the task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense but that cost valuable time public announcements from london about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown the timetable for arrival on battle stations near the falklands started stretching out longer and longer all this bought extra time for the joint commando team on south georgia island the drilling continued the other result of the sinking was equally important word was flashed to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible action it was obvious that the russian navy was getting involved in the atlantic which meant that the royal navy could be in big trouble during the dead of night early april the seven stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern new zealand they deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the antipodes islands miles southeast of new zealand their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack these shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it as i explained last month but once they arrived at the antipodes the stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the island headquarters the antipodes headquarters in turn was in constant touch with the south georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of south america the deployment of the available ships of the south pacific stealth fleet was exactly what the joint rockefeller-russian planners had hoped for the ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in new zealand the british ship 's sinking of april was also followed by other events on april the argentine navy started moving out of port the same day alexander haig arrived again in buenos aires supposedly he was there as a diplomat but in reality he was there as a general dealing with generals haig is the top governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel as i have revealed in the past he was making sure that the argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment four days later april haig left for washington as he boarded his plane haig somberly told reporters `` time is running out '' and so it was my friends for the secret south georgia base the very next day april the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base bolshevik military analysts in london had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend the british fleet was still out of range the weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small compact russian neutron bomb when it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave the effects were devastating the intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them meanwhile russian cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the stealth ships which were near the antipodes islands awaiting orders from a distance the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields which also protect against beam-weapon attack but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the russians employed floating overhead the cosmospheres located the seven ships using their psychoenergetic range-finding equipment known as prf as i have reported in the past there is no method known by which prf can be jammed the cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines the `` subs '' were armed with special non-homing non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact more sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode within minutes after the attack began all seven bolshevik stealth ships were on their way to the bottom and with them went their bolshevik commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world the south pacific action took place just after sunset local time the time here in washington was around 2:00 p.m. april that evening secretary of state haig was seen briefly in public with the new british foreign minister francis pym pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public but not haig haig was grinning from ear to ear and no wonder the joint rockefeller-russian military operation had been a brilliant success the secret bolshevik south atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out bottled up inside south georgia island and the south pacific fleet while not totally wiped out had been badly crippled by working together the rockefeller cartel and the russians had won the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic -- as i say these words news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the south atlantic but the real war in the southern hemisphere is already over what we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath that aftermath is the battle for the falkland islands they have been promised to argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war at this moment the bolsheviks here in washington are pressing for a public announcement that the united states will side with britain as soon as that takes place military action will heat up fast around the falklands britain has no choice but to fight she has already suffered casualties which can not be explained without a public battle but by fighting the bolsheviks in britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the royal navy meanwhile the rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building anti-nuclear-war campaign on all sides now we are hearing about the so-called `` nuclear freeze movement '' there are documentaries articles publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war in recent months there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war we are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously we are now years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time if you believe that my friends i give up movements like this never and i mean never develop without leadership organization and money -- and plenty of it what we are watching is the rockefeller public relations machine at work as i 've explained in the past the rockefeller cartel can not afford to let a nuclear war take place if it does they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it instead the deadly enemies of the rockefeller cartel the bolsheviks here will win out if there is a war and so the rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war the present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and russia but as russia 's new rulers know very well this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the rockefeller group it 's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the rockefellers the russians regard the united states as a house divided and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the rockefellers their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly bolshevik menace of all-out even suicidal nuclear war but once that is done they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the rockefeller cartel some day the rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda that objective is renewed power -- and power that moves them closer to their old dream of world government the bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new rockefeller antiwar campaign under bolshevik control the so-called reagan administration has become so hawkish that it 's scaring people the rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power these days the smell of war is in the air the falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense the rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war a new super-united nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill it will have teeth as presently envisioned the new organization will be based in geneva switzerland the working name though this may be changed is the `` world nonproliferation council '' the plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties but its true purpose will be to use fear -- the fear of war -- to control us all last minute summary now it 's time for my last minute summary in this audio letter i have reported on the reasons behind the so-called falkland islands crisis the crisis erupted because of secret bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the southern hemisphere these have been attacked by joint action of the rockefeller cartel and the russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable the attacks were successful but the results remain to be seen one result though is that the royal navy has now been drawn into a trap britain 's waterloo at sea may well be at hand my friends two factions are struggling for control over our united states -- the rockefeller cartel and the bolsheviks they differ in style but both seek to control us through fear if we are ever to rise above their trickery it must be through the power of our lord jesus christ our only hope as the scripture tells us our lord `` ... has not given us the spirit of fear but of power of love and of a sound mind '' we must learn to wage peace as our lord declared long ago `` blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god '' until next month god willing this is dr. beter thank you and may god bless each and every one of you."

_____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april press briefing by george stephanopolous the briefing room 10:10 a.m. edt mr. stephanopoulos as you know the president is soon to be on his way on amtrack to camden yards he 'll be throwing out the first pitch q it 's marc the maryland area transit it 's not amtrack mr. stephanopoulos oh it 's not amtrack well he 's going from union station you 're right excuse me q george what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with senate mr. stephanopoulos well as you know there are discussions between senator mitchell and senator dole this morning and i think that the president is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as possible we need this investment for summer jobs for immunization for highway construction for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this summer and the president continues to believe his program should be passed q will he compromise that 's the question mr. stephanopoulos well as you know the discussions are going on this morning in the senate betwen senator mitchell and senator dole let 's see what they come up with but the president believes his jobs program should go forward q george would the president be willing to accept billion for one year which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by -- mr. stephanopoulos well i do n't know what is being offered by either side the senate discussions are going on right now let 's see what happens today q would he go that far -- no matter what the republicans have offered so far would he go that far billion per year mr. stephanopoulos the president believes that his program should be passed at this time clearly we 're going to be willing to listen to what the senators might or might not be able to come up with but i 'm not going to get into figures right now let 's see what happens q it 's reasonable to assume is n't it from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote mr. stephanopoulos well the republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the president 's jobs bill than in doing something to create -- mr. stephanopoulos well the republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the president 's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action real jobs this summer for the american people i think there 's no question about that there 's been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few days q so you 'll need to compromise to get your package through mr. stephanopoulos we 'll see what happens with the conversations between senator mitchell and senator dole this morning q prepared to compromise -- mr. stephanopoulos the president 's prepared to listen to what senator mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with senator dole q does he feel that he has been defeated in his -- mr. stephanopoulos not in the least in fact he 's been very successful so far in the beginning of his term q how mr. stephanopoulos he passed his budget in record time in six weeks and it 's a budget which reduces the deficit by billion over five years and it 's a budget which provides for important investments in our future right now we 've also had strong passage of his jobs program through the house simply because a minority of republicans in the senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the president 's jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding overall q he ca n't beat this can he q the fact is they can do that mr. stephanopoulos well the republicans can stop action there 's no question about that q what are you going to do about it q george what do you know about these alleged notes taken by boris yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the president told boris yeltsin not to trust the japanese that when they say yes they mean no mr. stephanopoulos i think that 's a complete misreading of what happened at the meeting the context of the conversation was that president clinton was actually reassuring president yeltsin at the time about his conversations with prime minister miyazawa over the kuril islands and the prime minister 's belief that japan would play a constructive role in the g-7 process i mean this was a casual comment about japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring president yeltsin that he believed the japanese were serious about their commitment to the g-7 process q are you saying that the president said that when the japanese say yes they mean no mr. stephanopoulos that 's not -- i do n't know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue prime minister miyazawa intends to really go forward with the g-7 process q have there been any attempts to explain this to the japanese because apparently the japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be -- mr. stephanopoulos i 've seen the reports in the japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context it does talk about the japanese -- understanding the japanese points of view i do n't think it 's going to be a problem i believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but i 'm not positive q george was the specific comment that was made specific to the kuril island situation or was it a general observation on japanese etiquette mr. stephanopoulos the discussion was about -- q the specific comment is what i 'm asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the russian notes `` when the japanese say yes they mean no '' mr. stephanopoulos well it was a combination i mean i do n't think that 's the whole sentence i think that the specific comment was a broad general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that prime minister miyazawa means to keep the commitment q was he saying it facetiously first mr. stephanopoulos i think it was just a casual observation q and then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it up has the president sent a message mr. stephanopoulos no i do n't think the president spoke i believe that secretary christopher has made some calls but i 'm not sure exactly how many q well this obviously is a bigger deal than you 're making it out to be if christopher has had to make some calls mr. stephanopoulos no no it was just that we got the reports in vancouver and the secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no mr. stephanopoulos -- reports in vancouver and the secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding and i do n't believe there is on q what is our position about the japanese that they may have to say one thing but actualy mean another mr. stephanopoulos no the position on the japanese is as the president stated to president yeltsin throughout the two days he said that he had had a good conversation with prime minister miazawa prior to the summit he reiterated the u.s. position the long-standing support for the japanese position on the kuril islands but also reiterated prime minister miazawa 's commitment to move forward on the g-7 process and to play a constructive role and i think president yeltsin was very glad to hear that q after listening to secretary christopher on iraq for the last few days i 'm a little confused what is the u.s. policy do you want to see saddam hussein overturned mr. stephanopoulos it 's the same policy that secretary christopher has reiterated and all of the u.s officials have reiterated we expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all u.n. resolutions right now we do not have that compliance q throwing it out further that if iraq complies saddam ca n't stay in office mr. stephanopoulos right i think that that 's -- our judgment is that it is not possible for saddam hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in power but the important point is that we expect compliance by iraq with all u.n. resolutions and we will continue to demand it q and are you concerned the iran will become the dominant power in the area -- mr. stephanopoulos secretary christopher has also spoken to iran over the last several days and he says we also expect full iranian compliance with all international norms and stopping support of terrorism q that 's a very glib statement that he wo n't stay in power if he complies with u.n. resolutions on what logic do you base that mr. stephanopoulos right now saddam hussein is not complying with the u.n. resolutions at all he is not respecting the rights of his people as is required by the u.n. resolution he is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections he is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding armaments q well when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power mr. stephanopoulos well right now his power rests on the repression of his people if he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power q george back on the stimulus package why is it that you and the president accuse the republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock why is it that -- what evidence do you have that they just do n't have a genuine idealogical difference with you that 's in good faith mr. stephanopoulos well the fact that several times in the past the republicans many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster have supported the very funding they now seek to stop most especially the highway funding q george in regards to that some of the moderate republicans said that the white house erred by not being more open to them during the -- while the plan was put together that they had one sort of proforma meeting between the white house and the senate republicans and that was it does the administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some mr. stephanopoulos well i 'm not sure that it 's true that there was only one meeting i mean the president met with the republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his package he met with the entire senate republican caucus also for lunch and went up there we are continually in contact with as many republicans as we can find who have an interest in the president 's package we are interested in what they have to say as well but we believe that this program is important and we 're going to continue to fight for it q your all or nothing do it with the democrats alone strategy did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through mr. stephanopoulos well i mean i think that there is no question that under the senate rules a determined minority can frustrate activity i mean there is just no question about that you only need plus one to keep going plus one to keep going and to stop any action and that 's what the republicans are doing q going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer q work with republicans and try to woo some republicans into your camp mr. stephanopoulos i think we 're going to continue to look for the support of republicans whenever we can get it on the president 's intiatives q but on this one -- how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really did n't need republican votes are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes when you have to go through -- mr. stephanopoulos i ca n't see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road clearly the president 's going to continue to reach out when he can q you do n't have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you do n't plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the republicans in congress based on this experience mr. stephanopoulos obviously the president would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he 's going to continue to press for that we will continue to reach out to republicans there 's not question about that and we 'll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation in this case the republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward q they 're being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals forward mr. stephanopoulos i think they 're being -- q any ideas mr. stephanopoulos i think their amendments are being defeated i do n't know that they 're being denied q to present them mr. stephanopoulos that 's not exactly true i mean they get the votes -- q that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they 're playing mr. stephanopoulos unless they get a majority in support all the way around no that 's not exactly true q george one more on iraq is the administration backing any of the iraqi opposition grooming any new leadership q backing any of the iraqi -- leadership mr. stephanopoulos oh i -- again we 're pressing for iraqi compliance i do n't know if we can get into the business of grooming leadership i believe there have been some contacts at some levels with iraqi opposition groups i do n't know about anything recently q jesse jackson who of course is not the president 's best friend has however been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting or some kind of involvement by the president pre-empted the ball game -- los angeles will he consider something like that or any other kind of intervention there mr. stephanopoulos well as you know the president appointed commerce secretary ron brown about days ago to be a special envoy to california and coordiante cabinet activities around the california economic situation including the situation in los angeles i believe there will also be visits out to los angeles by the education -- or have been visits by the education secretary mr. riley i believe that transportation secretary pena and hud secretary cisneros are also going out and there may be other visits by cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks i would n't rule out the possibility of a visit by president clinton to california obviously he is following the situation closely and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent disturbances but we 're going to continue to watch it q george as a follow-up reverend jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today in baltimore with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball management does the president have a position on that mr. stephanopoulos the president has received correspondence from reverend jackson i know that reverend jackson has also spoken with the white house chief of staff mack mclarty he clearly raises serious questions there has been some progress in baseball over the last several years but still not enough but the president intends to continue to go to the ball game q is he going to say anything about it today or see reverend jackson while he 's out there mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know if he is going to see them but as i said the president believes that reverend jackson has raised some serious questions and it 's something that as i said even though there has been progress it 's clearly not enough q did reverend jackson ask him not to go to the ball game mr. stephanopoulos i 'm not sure about that i believe the characterization the reverend jackson is talking about is an informational pickett i do n't know that he asked him not to go to the ball game but he sent a long detailed formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the president read it q george the orioles are playing the rangers the managing partner of the rangers is george w. bush is he going to be there and is he going to meet with the president mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know q what is the mubarak schedule mr. stephanopoulos i know that president mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting they will have a lunch and i believe that he is having dinner tonight with vice president gore q and joint statements tomorrow -- mr. stephanopoulos i believe so yes at the end yes q is there evidence george that the egyptians did warn the u.s. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist activities mr. stephanopoulos as reported in the new york times i mean i think that president mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the egyptians as there have been for a long period of time we do have general intelligence sharing i mean but president mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward the president will continue to investigate the situation but he also reiterates his belief that we can not tolerate terrorism of any kind q george he did make specific -- or the egyptians apparently did issue specific warnings about this individual who forgive me -- this individual who forgive me the name escapes me at the moment and said the egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of action mr. stephanopoulos again i do n't know if i would agree with your characterization of the mubarak interview he did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the united states and upon which we took appropriate action but there was no specific information on this specific operation at all q so the white house does n't feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the cia or fbi who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of -- mr. stephanopoulos no not at all q what 's next with serbia it got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday -- mr. stephanopoulos you did n't get to ask your question q yes exactly was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries and even if there was n't what does the u.s. do next mr. stephanopoulos i think the u.s. is clearly going to move forward in the u.n. today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we 'll continue to look for ways to press the serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an agreement q george why do you think sanctions is still an option i mean the serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there 's no evidence that they 're going to have an effect any time soon the bosnian serbs have said no to the peace plan when does no mean no and you have to do something different mr. stephanopoulos well i mean we are doing something different we 're moving forward on further sanctions through the u.n. and those discussions will continue we 're going to continue to try and tighten the noose on serbia and i think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time q are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo mr. stephanopoulos the president has said that this is something that is under consideration q george do you have any more on hugh rodham 's condition how he 's doing mr. stephanopoulos as far as i know nothing 's changed q george -- week after mr. mubarak mr. stephanopoulos it 's a little unclear i think we 'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the mubarak visit q is he going somewhere for easter mr. stephanopoulos not that i know of q what more can you tell us about the additional aid to russia that the president plans to ask congress about mr. stephanopoulos he 's going to be consulting with the congress and with our g-7 partners over the next couple of weeks i know that he spoke last evening with congressman gephardt and their delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the russians this week and those consultations will continue over the next several weeks q do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announced sunday mr. stephanopoulos i 'm not going to discuss the magnitude q how about the list of cold war restrictions where do you stand on that -- mr. stephanopoulos as the president said yesterday he 's going to be looking for that list from the congress this week and reviewing it he believes -- he 's going to try and get it this week and he 's going to review the list and we 're going to take a hard look at it q but they 're making it up i mean it 's no white house involvement congress is compiling this list mr. stephanopoulos i think he 's going to talk to the congressional leaders about compiling the list but i 'm certain we 'll be able to get our own researchers working as well q george is n't lifting the arms embargo more of a probability than a possibility mr. stephanopoulos it 's something that 's under discussion q secretary christopher has said that it 's a matter of time and -- for months before that happens mr. stephanopoulos again all i can say is that it 's something that the president is reviewing right now we 're working with our allies in the u.n on a sanctions resolution and we 'll continue to review other matters q george can you tell us anything about the schedule this week any travel mr. stephanopoulos they just asked about that i do n't have anything more beyond tomorrow 's visit with mubarak right now q are there consultations george with any jewish american organizations concerning jackson-vanick mr. stephanopoulos as you know the national conference of soviet jewry has a list of i believe mr. stephanopoulos -- as you know the national conference of soviet jewry has a list of i believe refuseniks we 'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate discussions thanks

'' also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent you say `` granted the mormon belief ... '' you ca n't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant sophistry look who 's talking `` jumping to conclusions '' you would n't do that yourself right all you address is your own convictions regardless whether we come up with any biblical scriptures which supports our points of view because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever the bible states that lucifer was created the bible states that jesus is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine the former kgb would have loved to employ you jesus and lucifer are not `` the same '' silly and you know it ... the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god correction it may contradict would you think the bible says the bible indeed does teach that not all are children of god in the sense that they '' belong to '' or follow god in his footsteps satan and his followers have rebelled against god and are not `` children =followers/redeemed of god '' but it does n't mean that they were not once created by god but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow god and his plan of salvation the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked `` one '' matthew 13:38 so -- this illustrates nicely what i just said the children of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of jesus and have shown `` works of repentance etc and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against god and the lamb the issue of satan 's spirit-origin and of those who followed him has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your bible you purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your `` right '' with non- related scriptures ... lots of nice scriptures deleted not robert w. copyrighted though ... ra we are told that `` and this is life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent '' ra john 17:3 life eternal is to know the only true god yet the ra doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly ra different jesus a jesus that can not be reconciled with the jesus of ra the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim correction `` my '' jesus is indeed different than your jesus and can be reconciled with the jesus in the bible -- not your interpretation of him i concur but i honestly could n't care less ra one as being true denies the other from being true according to the ra bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination in this single posting of yours i 've seen more `` constructs of imagination '' than in all of the pro-lds mails combined i have read so far in this news group first get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about `` the only true god '' whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes but whose image i can not reconcile with what i know about him myself i guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths believing in the divinity of jesus christ but in a different way or fashion than your own not that it really matters the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visited every continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear this is really a red herring it does n't address any issue raised but rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read something into the bible does n't change what the bible teaches sigh `` what the bible teaches '' or `` what the bible teaches according to robert weiss and co. '' i respect the former i reject the latter without the remotest feeling that i have rejected jesus on the contrary and by the way i do respect your interpretations of the bible i even grant you being a christian following your own image of him as much as i am a christian following my own image of him in my heart ... most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine i don't think that it matters if mcconkie 's views were canon that is not the issue were mcconkie 's writings indicative of mormon belief on this subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may certainly be the issue is of course that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church the issue of `` official doctrine '' is obviously very important mcconkie 's views have been controversial e.g `` the seven deadly heresies '' has made me a heretic at best or erroneous at worst `` blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation '' i respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church but i personally do not rely on his personal interpretations his book `` mormon doctrine '' is oftentimes referred to as `` mcconkie 's bible '' in mormon circles on mormon doctrine i rather look to official doctrinal sources and ... to hugh nibley 's books the last comment is an lds-insider reference summarizing mcconkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of god than i have but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation but having said this i find mcconkie even in his most biased and speculative moments far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen i 'm somewhat appalled that i have allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting ... ============================= robert weiss psyrobtw ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu casper c. knies isscck byuvm.bitnet brigham young university isscck vm.byu.edu ucs computer facilities

'' the `` objective morality '' of god gets blurred by our inept interpretation of it we christians have made our biggest errors when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide exactly what god intended for us if we christians would stay committed to seeking god 's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all figured out we might do a better job of allowing others to find god's '' objective morality '' for themselves if jesus is who he said he was/is and that 's the fundamental question then he is `` objective morality '' john nunnally

'' also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent you say `` granted the mormon belief ... '' you ca n't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant sophistry look who 's talking `` jumping to conclusions '' you would n't do that yourself right all you address is your own convictions regardless whether we come up with any biblical scriptures which supports our points of view because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever the bible states that lucifer was created the bible states that jesus is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine the former kgb would have loved to employ you jesus and lucifer are not `` the same '' silly and you know it ... the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god correction it may contradict would you think the bible says the bible indeed does teach that not all are children of god in the sense that they '' belong to '' or follow god in his footsteps satan and his followers have rebelled against god and are not `` children =followers/redeemed of god '' but it does n't mean that they were not once created by god but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow god and his plan of salvation the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked `` one '' matthew 13:38 so -- this illustrates nicely what i just said the children of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of jesus and have shown `` works of repentance etc and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against god and the lamb the issue of satan 's spirit-offspring and those who followed him has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your bible you purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your `` right '' with non- related scriptures ... lots of nice scriptures deleted not robert w. copyrighted though ... ra we are told that `` and this is life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent '' ra john 17:3 life eternal is to know the only true god yet the ra doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly ra different jesus a jesus that can not be reconciled with the jesus of ra the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim correction `` my '' jesus is indeed different than your jesus and can be reconciled with the jesus in the bible -- not your interpretation of him i concur but i honestly could n't care less ra one as being true denies the other from being true according to the ra bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination in this single posting of yours i 've seen more `` constructs of imagination '' than in all of the pro-lds mails combined i have read so far in this news group first get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about `` the only true god '' whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes but whose image i can not reconcile with what i know about him myself i guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths believing in the divinity of jesus christ but in a different way or fashion than your own not that it really matters the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visited every continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear this is really a red herring it does n't address any issue raised but rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read something into the bible does n't change what the bible teaches sigh `` what the bible teaches '' or `` what the bible teaches according to robert weiss and co. '' i respect the former i reject the latter without the remotest feeling that i have rejected jesus on the contrary and by the way i do respect your interpretations of the bible i even grant you being a christian following your own image of him as much as i am a christian following my own image of him in my heart ... most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine i don't think that it matters if mcconkie 's views were canon that is not the issue were mcconkie 's writings indicative of mormon belief on this subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may certainly be the issue is of course that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church the issue of `` official doctrine '' is obviously very important mcconkie 's views have been controversial e.g `` the seven deadly heresies '' has made me a heretic at best or erroneous at worst `` blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation '' i respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church but i personally do not rely on his personal interpretations his book `` mormon doctrine '' is oftentimes referred to as `` mcconkie 's bible '' in mormon circles on mormon doctrine i rather look to official doctrinal sources and ... to hugh nibley 's books the last comment is an lds-insider reference summarizing mcconkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of god than i have but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation but having said this i find mcconkie even in his most biased and speculative moments far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen i 'm somewhat appalled that i have allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting ... ============================= robert weiss psyrobtw ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu casper c. knies isscck byuvm.bitnet brigham young university isscck vm.byu.edu ucs computer facilities

'' was not a nonsequitur but was intended to follow from the sentence that preceded it therefore i concluded that you believed that implied that stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in a but we 've already seen that does not imply this therefore you were incorrect to believe that implied that stephen thought it was okay to take quotes out of context in a and were making an error of a kind that is frequently made by creationists is that better jim it 's called an argument if you disagree with it explain why the argument is not sound i admit that my assumption in may have been a bit hasty if you agree with it just say `` yup '' dj '' yup '' -- jim 's e-mailed response when i pointed out in a posted article that one of his arguments was a straw man argument reminiscent of a frequent creationist ploy 3/22/93

20, document_id from david terminus.ericsson.se david bold subject re question for those with popular morality in article freenet.carleton.ca ad354 freenet.carleton.ca james owens writes in a previous article david terminus.ericsson.se david bold says i do n't mean to be rude but i think that you 've got hold of the wrong end of a different stick ... david i had a look at your posting again and i see what you mean i was so intent on explaining how jung thought we could be more moral than god that i overlooked your main line of thought you seem to be saying that god being unknowable his morality is unknowable yep that 's pretty much it i 'm not a jew but i understand that this is the jewish way of thinking however the jews believe that the covenant between yhwh and the patriarchs abraham and moses in this case establishes a moral code to follow for mankind even the jews could not decide where the boundaries fall though as i understand it the sadducees believed that the torah was all that was required whereas the pharisees the ancestors of modern judaism believed that the torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required morality in all its nuances talmud the essence of all of this is that biblical morality is an interface between man and yhwh for a jew or christian and does not necessarily indicate anything about yhwh outside of that relationship although one can speculate the first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created in his image so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever moral code he follows as part of trying to live up to that image if we are supposed to live by christ 's example you would be hard pressed to argue that god is a `` do what i say not what i do '' kind of guy the trouble with all of this is that we do n't really know what the `` created in his image '' means i 've heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion this rather upsets the apple cart if one wants to base a life script on this shaky foundation to mix metaphors unashamedly as to living by christ 's example we know very little about jesus as a person we only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers and some very small references from comtemporary historians revelation aside one can only `` know '' christ second-hand or worse this is not an attempt to debunk christianity although it may seem that way initially the point i m trying to make is that we only really have the bible to interpret and that interpretation is by humanity i guess this is where faith or relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness metaphysically if there are multiple moral codes then there is no absolute moral code and i think this is theologically questionable no there may be an absolute moral code there are undoubtably multiple moral codes the multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code as an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is `` wrong '' now the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar where there are no children the `` wrongness '' here is if the child disobeys the parent the parent may feel that it is `` inappropriate '' to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals the analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent and may be a parent later in life but you get the gist of it incidentally the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older see piaget and learns a morality of his own david -- on religion '' oh where is the sea `` the fishes cried as they swam its clearness through

20, document_id from rich.bellacera amail.amdahl.com subject part and part re homosexuality tony- i read your post it was nothing new i had seen much the same in other typical '' christian '' anti-gay sentimental literature gay people are and will con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates you may be unaware of all the statistica `` findings '' concerning african-americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against african-americans we usually think of the kkk in these instances but there are many other groups of course the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today but that was not always the case fortunately african-americans had `` whites '' who supported their 'cause and public sentiment was eventually if not entirely turned around there was even a civil war and anti-negro sentiment increased in fact until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them i know many gays and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination you may think that i have been deceived or something that is your perogative my church christian church disciples of christ openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society including gays we believe the gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples we believe in the lord 's great commandment to love and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed even if it is not popular to do so i really like my church for last reason the most i can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the gospel and believes in the commandment of love though i 'm hard-pressed to find many who actually sho love but not many are willing to champion the oppressed especially within their own community i may have lost face with the greater christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of african-americans many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being `` nigger-lovers '' and such i guess i've decided the challenge is worth it in my talks with gay men and women i have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process etc funny thing is i do n't know of one case where the parents ex-wives or even children have continued to reject their gay family member son daughter ex-husband father etc after they began to take part in some form of support group like pflag i 'm apalled by the legislation which passed in colorado and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as louis sheldon from the tradition values coalition have been actively working in the christian underground to garner support within several i believe states this coming november for more oppressive legisation against gays perhaps you do n't get it and maybe you never will many did n't get it in the middle ages and the proclaimed god 's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions the message that comes through loud and clear by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general is that there is a strong dislike even hatred for gays whether you want to call it such or not it does n't change the results the major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end the final effect of posts like that of yours and mr. hudson is that you have a '' conditional '' love for gays condition change and we 'll love you this is sure strange coming from a group who claim that god has an `` unconditional '' love one that calls people `` just as they are '' sure there are things that will 'naturally change and habits like alcoholism wife beating etc that need to be changed through some sort of therapy but then there are things like left-handedness etc that no amount of beating it out of people is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to `` other people 's expectations '' in the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality this is sad but i thoroughly believe that one day it will change it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like 'sexuality a taboo subject even today but i firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms it 's funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression ... as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society gay people are not criminals another interesting thing happened recently a very prominent charismatic church in the silicon valley here had two of it 's pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty men having sex with boys this had apparently been going on for some time a couple years but since the charges were voluntary and the church worked closely with the police so i imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media how could such a thing happen when the church itself has an ex-gay ministry one of my friends recently told me he was `` approached '' by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry these are difficult times we live in but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the christian community the results of the passing amendment in colorado has created an organization who 's posters are appearing all over colorado called `` s.t.r.a.i.g.h.t '' i forget the whole definition off hand but the last part was against immoral gross homosexual trash and their motto is `` working for a fag-free america '' with an implicit advocation for violence this is sick and it seems to be what you and mr. hudson and others are embracing we christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel do n't 'measure up and constant beratement from organizations like the christian research institute while they do have a good purpose also their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people the gospel i believe is not so negative rather it seeks ways to `` include '' people i have several of dr. martin 's books and find them quite helpful especially concerning 'cults but it seems that cri has become a cult unto itself why do n't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away

anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings in the first place and to respect for let alone love of `` god '' in near succession please go back to my quoted words above the `` possibility that always exists '' is that i or to revert to proper time sequence my predecessors over the last several centuries could persuade `` christian b '' of my case that the inquisition does indeed constitute an egregious violation of the law of love i must also note that the majority of christians have been so persuaded by christian argumentation as well as by secular both christian and non-christian prohibitions what mr. turpin alludes to is a trickier point a. i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved in the inquisition b the inquisitor responds that mother church must however painful this seems `` discipline '' her children for their own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls or if the tortured heretic will not recant than by bad example `` deterring '' others from the same loss-of-soul a. i point out that this `` justification '' of a failure in love depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable b. burns me at the stake my rhetoric has failed but the point i am making is sustained what is going on here has a lot to do with `` cultural baggage '' in this case the baggage includes a nearly universal and absolutely secular belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture the elimination of inqisitorial practice in those places where it has been eliminated or at least greatly reduced has very little if anything to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between a and b. mr. turpin is pointing out that if i am a versus the grand inquisitor 's b then my persuasion is not very likely to work i know this and in what- ever personal agony i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense attorney so `` one possibility '' fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others at the other extreme the `` persuasion '' will succeed when it properly should not if it entails mistaken assumptions i share with the inquisitor and that is potentially an even more troubling case in that many of the victims of inquisition will have `` accepted '' that they were in fact sinful in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them the point is that the `` persuasion '' breaks down when the parties do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the inquisition against `` heresy '' it is bound to break down in precisely the `` worst '' cases the `` conservative '' i do n't think that is the right word btw will take refuge in what i attribute to b above that he is `` justified '' in causing harm because he thinks that works to a `` greater good '' but this is a violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel as if one 's theories about `` sin '' entitled one to cast aside jesus words on dealing with sinners cf matthew 5:39ff i am a `` radical '' christian only in that i take the gospel seriously or for that matter what does it mean to love one 's fellow man and what is the `` right thing '' and how does one go about loving god well the whole point of making these the `` base '' commandments is that they are n't reducible to rules a set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used instead of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one 's actions the great commandment is more than anything else a call to act as if you were god and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action a demand that i like most would rather not hear but it keeps popping up nonetheless along with the reassurance that it is more important that i be open to trying this than succeeding at it `` conservatives '' may twist this `` act as if you were god '' to mean `` lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they do n't keep your rules '' they are so insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced a lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy is how god acts that after all is the standard accusation `` against god '' by the atheists here and elsewhere that the `` conservatives '' have confused their manipulative hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the nature of god is almost the entire content of standard american atheism -- and i quite agree with it on this point ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo up front much of which sounds pretty much the same but by the specific acts procedures and arguments that they recommend and different bodies of christians have from the beginning urged different `` ethical systems '' or in some cases none as a result it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popular or infamous with christianity christianity does not have a torah it does not have a qu'ran specifically christian scripture has very little if anything in the way of `` commandments '' -- so little that the `` christians '' who desperately want commandments go `` mining '' for them with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation for their efforts the one single thing in the gospels which jesus specifically `` gives '' as `` a commandment '' to us is `` love one another '' i will be expanding on this point in a reply to paul hudson that i hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that some christians infer lots of commandments from the nt i'll point out what has to be going on in these inferences and why there is a huge amount of `` cultural baggage '' involved you are quite right that this is `` goo '' if one is looking for an ethical system but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do it may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems -- in which case i will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again i am glad that a few christians such as michael find a benign meaning for the goo and then interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive fashion on the other hand i do think that this tells us more about michael and christians like him that it tells us about christianity i think you are begging the question why do n't i and the myriads of other christians like me tell you something about christianity nor is this very new in christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the quakers from the 17th century onwards and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case -- michael l. siemon i say `` you are gods sons of the mls panix.com most high all of you nevertheless or you

20, document_id from deane binah.cc.brandeis.edu david matthew deane subject re flaming nazis in article 1qsami 3h7 access.digex.net dickeney access.digex.com dick eney writes the trouble with trying to find out the truth is that roehm and his buddies were accused of being flaming faggots one of the pretexts for the night of long knives in which roehm and most of the sa wing of the nsdap were purged stop hold it you have a few problems here official history says that the first accusations of homosexuality in the sa came from outside of the nazi party long before the nazis ever came to power so this objection is a red herring even if established history is wrong on this point moreover none of the histories i 've read ever made mention of hitler or anyone else ever using homosexuality as a pretext for purging roehm a point i saw reiterated was that hitler and the party covered up these accusations if you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication you should at least get your facts right the pretext for purging roehm was that he was planning to use the sa in a coup against hitler nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge nor as a justification afterwards it is possible that the histories i 've read have not mentioned this but i doubt it would it be in hitler 's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual anyway as i said before it is always possible that i have missed references to the nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the sa after the night of the long knives but this does not prove that they were false even the nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage in any case this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the sa during the 's since the accusers thereafter controlled the records anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered tainted evidence ah yes i forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy i can smell the paranoia from here since the nazis never officially charged roehm with homosexuality at least not according to what i 've read i 'd like to know what tainted `` evidence '' you are talking about since the accusations were made by persons outside of the nazi party long before it came to power and those accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in germany in the 's and 's just how would it be possible for the nazis to go back in time and plant `` tainted '' evidence how exactly does one doctor newspapers which were circulated around the world without the discrepancies being obvious what actual incidences of nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about and what about the testimony of people who were involved in these matters some of whom were not nazis and what is the point of making a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it since the point here seems to be to discredit established history then the burden of proof falls on the revisionist the revisionists had better do their homework before making accusations otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts the available data suggest that roehm and his crowd the sa -- sturmabteilung `` storm troopers '' -- left the world a better place when they departed this is just about the only thing we agree on i suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people roehm and his sa buddies who were homosexuals must disturb some people the feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals this fear often justified is what lies behind this distrust of official history or so it seems to me but this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject if you really think that historians are so incompetent why do n't you write them and ask where they got their sources on this subject if you ca n't tell from their footnotes i 'm a graduate student in history writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat but my time is limited and this is not my specialty and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence i 'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone 's paranoia do the research yourself but concrete particulars are still no more than more or less shrewd guesses -- diccon frankborn given that you already consider all evidence `` tainted '' what on earth would constitute concrete particulars and since when have concrete particulars been considered `` shrewd guesses '' i suggest that those who do not trust popular historians irving et al historians writing for a popular audience do not as a rule provide copious footnotes should try instead reading academic historians who usually provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail this is the place to start looking assuming that one really wants to know the truth i 'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already my apologies we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent i forget which gods are responsible for keeping strings

20, document_id from hedrick athos.rutgers.edu charles hedrick subject re clarification of personal position jesus and the law sandvik newton.apple.com kent sandvik writes my online bible is on a cd but i do n't own a cd-rom system for the time being so i ca n't search for the famous cite where jesus explicitly states that he did n't want to break existing jewish laws in other words technically speaking christians should use saturday and not sunday as their holy day if they want to conform to the teachings of jesus i think the passage you 're looking for is the following matthew 5:17 `` think not that i have come to abolish the law and the prophets i have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them matthew 5:18 for truly i say to you till heaven and earth pass away not an iota not a dot will pass from the law until all is accomplished matthew 5:19 whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven matthew 5:20 for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven there are several problems with this the most serious is that the law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews but not on gentiles there are rules that were binding on all human beings the so-called noachic laws but they are quite minimal the issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them did n't say that the law was abolished it simply acknowledged that fact that it did n't apply to gentiles this is a simple answer which i think just about everyone can agree to a discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in acts however there 's more involved in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grips with paul 's apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law at least as i read paul he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded again this issue is n't one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that that 's not what he intends to say rather he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately it 's an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by christ paul 's comments are not the world's clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law it still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for its purpose of convicting of sin it 's important that it not be relaxed however for christians it 's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith not law while the theoretical categories they use are rather different in the end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion the quoted passage from mat should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesus shows us how he interprets the law the `` not an iota or dot '' would suggest a rather literal reading but in fact that 's not jesus approach jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial details indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher laws some scholars claim that mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st cent jewish discussions jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things that really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity mat 23:23-25 this and the discussion later in mat suggest that jesus has a very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining the law in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of it paul 's conclusion is similar while he talks about the law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the '' ceremonial law '' such as circumcision and the sabbath he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being superceded and jesus talks about the law being maintained i believe they are talking about different aspects of the law paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision as is natural in letters responding to specific situations he 's looking at the aspect of the law that is currently causing trouble the law as specifically jewish ceremonies he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seems to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give paul so much trouble it 's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts look at the way terms like `` family values '' take on special meaning from the current context imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why `` family values '' should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u.s i think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was involved in paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values that go along with the term `` law '' any more than people who concerned about the `` family values '' movement are really opposed to family values
20, document_id from dickeney access.digex.com dick eney subject re swastika was hitler pagan or christian the observation that the tree of life would rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't give enough consideration to the feebleness of the coriolis force compared to say the phototropism of vegetation a much more likely explanation is the classic one that the clockwise swastika is the sun-wheel because the sun progresses across the sky that way although that 's not the historical way it happened clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens so it 's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise but do the engineers listen to me of course not anyway there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents evil or because it is the sun 's twin-opposite the moonwheel the use of anti-sun to represent evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented but i 'm not going to try to settle that one just now -- diccon frankborn dickeney access.digex.com

through the arch angel gabriel he is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the qur'an by allah swa all praise be to him muhammad saw lived between 571-632 ac all other

abraham also a messenger of allah he is the messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming the above mentioned verse from the qur'an is from chapter verse whose rough translation is as

himself prophet in fact as a shown by the words of the most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the wise our'an even they could not deny the occurrence of his miracles but only called them -hasha wa kella allah forbids sorcery in order to satisfy themselves or to deceive their followers the miracles of muhammad saw have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of ulema scholars of islam to the hundreth degree the miracle is the conformation by the creator of the universe of his declaration of prophethood it has the effect of the words 'you have indeed spoken the truth suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler while being observed by him 'the true ruler has appointed me to such and such position 'at a time when you were asked to prove your claim the word 'yes' uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you or if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word 'yes in the same way allah 's most noble messenger claimed i am the envoy of the creator of this universe my proof is that he will change his unbroken order at my request and my prayer now look at my fingers he makes them run like a fountain with five spigots look at the moon by a gesture of my finger he splits it in two look at that tree to affirm me and to bear witness to me it moves and comes near to me look at this food although it is barely enough for two or three men it satisfies two or three hundred 'further he shows hundreds of similar miracles however the evidences of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles all his deeds and acts his words and behavior his moral conduct and manners his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness indeed many people such as abdullah b. salam the famous scholar of the children of israel came to belief merely by seeing him and said 'no lie can hide in this face nor can any fraud be found in it although many of the researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand there are thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs of his prophethood and hundreds of thousands of truth-seeking men muhakkikiin with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways the wise our'an alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away then the prophethood of muhammad saw is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others for whatever evidences qualities and attributes became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as jesus as and moses as they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by muhammad saw and since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of muhammad saw this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- to be continued allah

'' in karl kellner 1850-1905 a wealthy austrian industrialist and paper chemist as well as a high-grade mason founded the ordo templi orientis kellner had traveled widely in the east where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices kellner 's efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franz hartmann heinrich klein and theodore reuss who had worked together prior to joining the o.t.o the order was first proclaimed in in reuss 's masonic publication 'oriflamme on kellner 's death reuss succeeded him as outer head o.h.o. the 'jubilee edition of the 'oriflamme published in announced that the order taught secret of sexual magic `` theodore reuss was an interesting character born june in augsburg he entered masonry in he was a singer journalist and possibly a spy for the prussian political police infiltrating the socialist league founded by karl marx 's daughter and her husband reuss was later associated with william wynn westcott a leader of the golden dawn who later introduced him to john yarker yarker chartered reuss to found the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany after several attempts to concretize various masonic rites reuss settled on the development of the o.t.o `` the order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss leadership for example he chartered papus in france rudolph steiner in berlin and h. spencer lewis in the usa in the historic meeting between reuss and crowley occurred crowley wrote that reuss came to him and accused him of revealing order secrets when crowley looked at it afresh the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of all the english speaking world and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the equinox `` reuss resigned as outer head of the order in after suffering a stroke and named crowley his successor all was well until when _the book of the law_ was translated into german there was a break in the continuity of the order manyk members split with the new o.h.o over the book which crowley was actively promulgating through the order he had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reuss 's request deeply infusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation '' _an introduction to the history of the o.t.o._ by ad veritatem ix' within _equinox iii:10_ edited by hymenaeus beta frater superior rex summus sanctissimus caliph of the united states of america published by samuel weiser there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included this material in _equinox iii:10_ and this is the real point is it not why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of thelema or is he exercising his true will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers a picture which leaves room for very many interpretations it is quite easy for me to see for example that all of o.t.o derived out of the dribble of faltering masonry purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them and i can take that all the way down to our present caliph whose feeble support of the 'law of thelema is laughable at best would i be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way will i i think not why because my frater will see it as a perspective an interjection i am using as an example my illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first so it may be with oto and merlinus x please look o.t.o more carefully i do not support reuss 's words myself as i am not qualified to assess them and i am critical of their pomposity if i who am a member of the order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so then what can this say about the health of the order does it mean that the order has 'gone soft and abandoned its moral principles or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own not shackled by some dogmatic requirement how shall we resolve these two possibilities i find a high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientis they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information they are quite often artists and geniuses having met some longstanding members in the sf bay area many who are or were very heavily involved with the order i can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands i have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta in these moments i followed my intuition and i 've found little to stop me from requesting a second initiation from a different o.t.o body i 'm happily participating in social groups feasts or initiations and have come to know the gnostic mass well enough for my tastes this does n't make me an authority on order politics and explanations however i can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand based on my limited contact with other members i urge you not to take the words of merlinus x too far there are many ways to interpret words and many people who have become involved with the order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision i welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread invoke me under my stars love is the law love under will i am i frater i nigris dclxvi cccxxxiii

`` i 'd like to give the award back '' caligiuri now laughs `` i'm no longer deserve it '' caligiuri 's eight year involvement with the national `` ex-gay '' movement peaked with his founding of the phoenix chapter of homosexuals anonymous ha as well as free indeed he has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception `` there 's no reality in it '' he says `` i was selling a product and my product was a lie '' headed up by national ministries like exodus international and courage the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing christianity `` we offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality '' explains bob davies director of exodus he ventures that `` about of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men '' `` anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time '' says lisa seeley a former `` redeemed lesbian '' who worked with caligiuri as ha and appeared with him on the sally jessy raphael show `` these organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded '' `` it 's possible to change your identity or your behavior '' says sex educator brian mcnaught author of _on being gay_ `` but it 's really impossible to change your orientation these people are no longer calling themselves gay but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings '' caligiuri says he founded free indeed after an ominous week in when all hell broke loose in his personal life a few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar `` i was really drunk '' he recalls `` and i went home with this guy he tied me up and raped me he left me tied up all night and the next morning he raped me again '' when caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover `` he had another man there with him '' caligiuri recalls `` i thought at this time 'if this is what being gay is about i do n't want to be this way anymore '' caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out he would share his discovery with others he organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at phoenix's gay pride parade in june and a few months later free indeed held its first public protest at a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance free indeed members loudly blasted gays telling them ther were sinners headed for hell free indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages `` we were listed under lesbian and gay alternative services '' caligiuri says `` so people thought we were a gay information switchboard people would call to find out where the local bars were and we 'd preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality '' ruses like this are typical of the movement caligiuri says adding `` they 'll do anything to reach these people '' `` david used to go on radio and say really stupid things '' recalls peter kelly a counselor at phoenix 's catholic diocese aids program `` like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors '' caligiuri 's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on raphael 's syndicated talk show in `` they were relieved '' he recalls `` they figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family better that i should be a 'reformed gay person '' but caligiuri was hardly reformed `` by the time i appeared on sally's show '' `` i 'd started having sex with men again men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin sex with their pastor sex with their father i was horny all the time '' unable to risk going to gay bars where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances caligiuri says he `` used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs '' when he was n't working the bookstores he was sleeping with other `` reformed '' homosexuals `` i did n't realize it at first but a lot of the ha leaders were having sex with one another '' caligiuri says `` we 'd go to conferences in other cities and we 'd be paired up in hotel rooms everybody was sleeping with everybody else '' by the time he appeared on 'am philadelphia television show in may caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week when the show's host asked him if he ever `` acted on temptation '' his answer was a lie caligiuri 's duplicity began to take it 's toll on him however he was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis a dibilitating yeast infection and this led to his escape from the sect `` i was too sick to go to church '' he explains `` the more time i spent away from those people the more i began to feel like myself i began to remember who i used to be '' late in caligiuri turned free indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry 's doors `` i 'd convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people '' he says today caligiuri is studying alternative spiritualities `` i 'm interest- ed in belief systems that are n't judgemental `` considering romance `` but not with a christian `` and searching for a new project to devote himself to `` i feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes '' he says `` i want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what i did and make up for the damage i may have brought to our community '' -- -end article -- caligiuri 's tory is by no means unique and i have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay ministries who have said very similar th similar things fortuantely not all of them have left christianity but have come to realize that god loves them despite the attitudes of others some like chris glaser director of the presbyterian `` lazarus project '' of west hollywood presbyterian church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay i have also as i said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as `` love in action '' and others who either once claimed to have been `` reformed '' or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie no matter who was disappointed in them some were even encouraged to marry as a way of `` sealing '' their new heterosexuality only to eventually start hitting the bars bathhouses and bookstores since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous `` sin '' through a committed relationship this is a horrible trap which the church has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people heterosexuality or celebacy this is sad what is also mrtifying is in the cases of those who can not suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them they may even opt for 'suicide or surgical dampering of the brain functions in the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place there are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive christianity toward gays such as sylvia pennington's '' ex-gays there are none_ and others there are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as maury johnston 's _gays under grace_ and chris glaser 's _come hom i seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance thank you

20, document_id subject re albert sabin from lippard skyblu.ccit.arizona.edu james j. lippard in article c5p660.36t sunfish.usd.edu rfox charlie.usd.edu writes ... in article 1993apr15.225657.17804 rambo.atlanta.dg.com wpr atlanta.dg.com bill rawlins writes however one highly biased account as well as possibly internally inconsistent written over mellenia ago in a dead language by fanatic devotees of the creature in question which is not supported by other more objective sources and isnt even accepted by those who 's messiah this creature was supposed to be does n't convince me in the slightest especially when many of the current day devotees appear brainwashed into believing this pile of guano ... since you have referred to the messiah i assume you are referring to the new testament please detail your complaints or e-mail if you do n't want to post first-century greek is well-known and well-understood have you considered josephus the jewish historian who also wrote of jesus in addition the four gospel accounts are very much in harmony bill i have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the josephus reference to be an early christian insert by biblical scholar i mean an expert who in the course of his or her research is willing to let the chips fall where they may this excludes literalists who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists they find what they want to find they are not trustworthy by scholarly standards and others why an insert read it i have a number of times the passage is glaringly out of context and josephus a superb writer had no such problem elsewhere in his work the passage has nothing to do with the subject matter in which it lies it suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears i think this is a weak argument the fact is there are two references to jesus in _antiquities of the jews_ one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by christians origen wrote in the third century that josephus did not recognize jesus as the messiah while the long passage says the opposite there is an arabic manuscript of _antiquities of the jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for jesus and may be authentic there is no question that origen in the third century saw a reference to jesus in josephus there are no manuscripts of _antiquities_ which lack the references it is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted but i do n't think it 's very likely -- nor do i think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case i know g.a wells takes this position but that 's because he takes the very small minority view that jesus never existed and he is a professor of german not of biblical history or new testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of jesus jim lippard lippard ccit.arizona.edu dept of philosophy lippard arizvms.bitnet university of arizona tucson az
