1, livesey solntze.wpd.sgi.com jon livesey subject re morality was re political atheists in article 1ql5sninn4vm gap.caltech.edu keith cco.caltech.edu keith allan schneider writes livesey solntze.wpd.sgi.com jon livesey writes so you are saying that it is n't possible for an instinctive act to be moral one i like to think that many things are possible explain to me how instinctive acts can be moral acts and i am happy to listen for example if it were instinctive not to murder ... then not murdering would have no moral significance since there would be nothing voluntary about it that is in order for an act to be an act of morality the person must consider the immoral action but then disregard it weaker than that there must be the possibility that the organism it 's not just people we are talking about can consider alternatives so only intelligent beings can be moral even if the bahavior of other beings mimics theirs you are starting to get the point mimicry is not necessarily the same as the action being imitated a parrot saying `` pretty polly '' is n't necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of polly and how much emphasis do you place on intelligence see above animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily but they do n't they do i and other posters have given you many examples of exactly this but you seem to have a very short memory are you trying to say that this is n't an act of morality because most animals are n't intelligent enough to think like we do i 'm saying '' there must be the possibility that the organism it 's not just people we are talking about can consider alternatives '' it 's right there in the posting you are replying to jon
1, dpw sei.cmu.edu david wood new in this version challenge plus an addendum summarizing charley 's responses to-date .. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- this is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage charley wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently specious claims i 'll continue to re-post periodically until he answers them publicly indicates that he wo n't answer them stops posting to the community tells me to stop or i get totally bored i apologize for the somewhat juvenile nature of this approach but i 'm at a loss to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and seeming intellectual dishonesty this is re-post charley i ca n't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts i submit that you do n't answer them because you can not answer them without running afoul of your own logic and i once again challenge you to prove me wrong to make the task as easy for you as possible i 'll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period i will re-post this article with suitable additions and deletions at such time that i notice a post by you on another topic i will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup i would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice if you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles i will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it from this list now to the questions ... after claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you were n't referring to all atheists i asked you to name some atheists who you feel do n't fit your patterns to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of you failed to do so please do so now question can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype here is the context for the question this is not true for everyone on this board and you are out of line in assuming that it is you however deleted the text further along where i said that i did n't mean to imply that everybody 's experience was along the same lines whether or not you mean to make such implications you do so repeatedly allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name those atheists that you 've come across who do not fit into the patterns that you theorize you have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that `` senses and reason are all we have to go by '' and when pressed you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation i have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason you failed to do so please do so now question can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning here is the context for the question revelation is not reason and if we do have revelation then reasoning is not all we have first show me that revelation exists second if revelation is not perceived through the senses how exactly is it perceived according to my webster 's revelation is `` an act of revealing or communicating divine truth '' now tell me how such a thing can be revealed/ communicated other than via the senses tell me how you can interpret this revelation other than with reason that is using your brain to interpret what you are sensing when i say there is no way for a human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as interpreted by reason your brain it is because this is the simple truth if you have another mechanism of interface by all means share it with us then later ... you can not escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is our senses and our reason period again this is indefensible no it is simple truth i challenge you to show me otherwise then later ... few mystics will agree to this assertion and the common defense of redefining `` senses '' to absorb for instance mystical experiences is begs the question of whether some senses are better than others i allow you the broadest definition of senses to make things easier for you now show me that `` mystical experiences '' exist remember you are n't allowed to go by testimony of others e.g. mystics since you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable you know tainted by my own bias further once these mystical thingies are absorbed show me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of interpretation via that person 's reasoning capabilities i challenge you to show me these things if you can not do so you might as well give up the fight then later ... let me reiterate you have not explained your interpretation of your experiences so it is not possible for me to have attacked them in point of fact i specifically challenged you to explain this revelation stuff that you were talking about and i note for the record that you appear to have declined my challenge what is it how is it sensed how is it interpreted and how does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit of our senses and reasoning abilities you have answered none of these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims if you ca n't answer them your claims are entirely specious you have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical i asked you to identify one such claim that i have made you have failed to do so please do so now question have i made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical if so please repeat them here is the context for the question i must thank david wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong posting then later ... likewise the reference to `` unverifiable fantastical claims '' represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group give me your address and i 'll be pleased to send you a dictionary failing that can you name one claim that i have made that is in any sense unverifiable or fantastical i demand that you retract this statement if you can not offer up evidence if you follow your usual pattern of ignoring the challenge then you are simply an asshole first you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason then later you stated that if one accepted the '' axioms '' of reason that one could n't help but become atheist i asked you to explain the contradiction your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent an opinion not shared by others that i have asked be they atheist or theist you have failed to answer the question please do so now question do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason despite their testimony to that effect if you do n't retract that claim do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism here is the context for the question first quote ... we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is based on reason ... it is up to atheists to prove it to me ... then second quote ... but i do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with an atheistic point of view first you claimed that you would probably not answer these challenges because they contained too much in the way of `` included text '' from previous posts later you implied that you wouldn't respond because i was putting words in your mouth please clarify this seeming contradiction question do you prefer to respond to challenges that include context from your own posts or that i paraphrase your positions in order to avoid `` included text '' here is the context for the question first you said my ordinary rules are that i do n't read articles over over lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen these are not rules of morality but practicality then later ... if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they can not be argued with as usual your responses are awaited with anticipation -- dave wood p.s. for the record below is a compilation of charley 's responses to these challenges to date 3/18/93 this makes no sense to me at all it gives the appearance either of utter incoherence or of answering some question of mr. wood 's imagination 3/31/93 mr wood i do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet thrown down on the net requires any response whatsoever at some point i might read and respond to your article and then again i might not my ordinary rules are that i do n't read articles over over lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen these are not rules of morality but practicality 3/31/93 i left out something else i do n't respond to ... utmost on my list of things to avoid are arguments about the arguments meta-arguments as some call them 4/3/93 when i have to start saying `` that 's not what i said '' and the response is '' did so `` there 's no reason to continue if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they can not be argued with subject re political atheists
1, kmr4 po.cwru.edu keith m. ryan subject re `` cruel '' was re political atheists in article 1ql8mdinn674 gap.caltech.edu keith cco.caltech.edu keith allan schneider writes this whole thread started because of a discussion about whether or not the death penalty constituted cruel punishment which is forbidden by the us constitution yes but they did n't say what they meant by `` cruel '' which is why a you have the supreme court and b it makes no sense to refer to the constitution which is quite silent on the meaning of the word `` cruel '' they spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the constitution they picked words whose meanings implied the intent we have already looked in the dictionary to define the word is n't this sufficient we only need to ask the question what did the founding fathers consider cruel and unusual punishment hanging hanging there slowing being strangled would be very painful both physically and psychologicall i imagine firing squad note not a clean way to die back in those days etc all would be considered cruel under your definition all were allowed under the constitution by the founding fathers -- `` whatever promises that have been made can than be broken. `` john laws a man without the honor to keep his given word

1, keith cco.caltech.edu keith allan schneider subject re objective morality was re political atheists livesey solntze.wpd.sgi.com jon livesey writes i want to know how this omniscient being is going to perform the feat of `` definitely '' terming actions right or wrong if you were omniscient you 'd know who exactly did what and with what purpose in mind then with a particular goal in mind you sould be able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance with the general goal i do n't think you 've show the existence of any objective moral system they exist but in practice they are difficult to perfectly emulate i mean you understand the concept of an objective system right i thought you were explaining it to us i certainly don't understand what you are explaining in an objective system there are known goals then actions are judged as either being compatible with these goals or not simple the problem with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ that is the goals of each society are different note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one the concept of innocence is dependent on whether certain actions are '' right '' or `` wrong '' and this depends on the moral system but if we have an objective system then someone can be deemed innocent or not quite easily by an omniscient person anyway i think i cleared up the recursive definition of `` murder '' because no one is complaining about it i do n't think it solves anything to speculate where we would be if we did have an objective moral system the question is still whether you can even say what one is i 've said it many many times and for what it 's worth i do n't think you cleared up anything concerning murder which part do you have a problem with what do you mean by `` harmed '' is it harm if you have to spend your existence metabolising food for another species oh most moral systems would be considered only within a species it is okay for us to enslave other animals right but not humans ... of course ideally perhaps we would n't even have to bother any other animals ... one the first point it 's wrong to enslave humans according to my persoanl moral system on the second point i 'm a vegetarian but we can enslave the animals right but just not kill them or are you a vegetarian for health reasons so are you a vegetarian no i fail to see how my personal views are relevant anyway is it wrong to eat animals in your personal moral system of course not it seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species for food it might be nice though if the other animals were not made to suffer for instance a cow in a field lives out its life just about the same way it would in the wild they seem happy enough however the veal youngsters are n't treated very well how about an `` objective '' moral system i do n't know what is the goal of this particular system there is no inherent system how about a `` natural '' moral system nope again it seems okay to kill other species for food keith
1, tgk cs.toronto.edu todd kelley subject re faith and dogma marshall csugrad.cs.vt.edu kevin marshall 1r2eba hsq csugrad.cs.vt.edu wrote i do n't necessarily disagree with your assertion but i disagree with your reasoning faith bad dogma bad religion faith dogma religion bad bad religion bad unfortunately you never state why faith and dogma are dangerous faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on faith alone which by its nature is without justification that is what i mean by the word `` faith '' belief without justification or belief with arbitrary justification or with emotional irrational justification for example when someone says that god exists that they do n't know why they believe god exists they can just feel it that 's faith dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based on new information or increased mental faculty so christians are totally irrational irrational with respect to their religion only what are you saying one 's belief in a christian god does not make one totally irrational i think i know what you were getting at but i 'd rather hear you expand on the subject faith and dogma are irrational the faith and dogma part of any religion are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals i claim that faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion if that makes the much overused in this context buddism a philosophy rather than a religion i can live with that science is not a religion because there is no faith nor dogma a philosopher can not be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind whereas a christian can not due to the nature of faith and dogma present in any religion again this statement is too general a christian is perfectly capable of being a philosopher and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind faith in god is a belief and all beliefs may change would you assert that atheists would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a god which of course may show unfair bias when studying say religion have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists if a philosopher is not an atheist s/he tends to be called a theologian a christian tends to consider christianity sacred christianity is a special set of beliefs sanctioned by god himself and therefore to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence of that being who makes no mistakes faith comes into play dogma comes into play `` the lord works in mysterious ways '' is an example of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed sure interpretations of what `` god said '' are changed to satisfy the needs of society but when god says something that 's it it was said and that 's that since god said it it is unflawed even if the interpretations are flawed science as would be practiced by atheists in contrast has a built in defence against faith and dogma a scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to suit whatever is the best information available at the time and and and a scientist understands that any current beliefs are deficient in some way the goal is to keep improving the beliefs the goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect the best information currently available that 's the only rational thing to do that 's good philosophy can you see the difference science views beliefs as being flawed and new information can be obtained to improve them how many scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding of everything none -- -it would put them out of a job religion views its beliefs as being perfect and the interpretations of those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which conflicts with them please explain how `` just because '' thinking kills people and please state more in your answer than `` waco '' it 's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he does n't require a good rational justification of the killing i do n't consider `` he 's jewish '' or `` he was born of jewish parents '' or `` this document says he 's jewish '' to be good rational justification by the way i was n't aware mass suicide was a problem waco and jonestown were isolated incidents mass suicides are far from common clinton and the fbi would love for you to convince them of this it would save the us taxpayer a lot of money if you could todd

1, spbach lerc.nasa.gov james felder subject re some thoughts in article saturn.wwc.edu bissda saturn.wwc.edu dan lawrence bissell writes first i want to start right out and say that i 'm a christian it makes sense to be one have any of you read tony campollo 's book- liar lunatic or the real thing i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy just what organization did he belong to does it have a name the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was logic alert artificial trifercation the are many other possible explainations could have been that he never existed there have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that jc is an amalgam of a number of different myths mithra comes to mind some reasons why he would n't be a liar are as follows who would die for a lie would n't people be able to tell if he was a liar people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed call me a fool but i believe he did heal people logic alert argument from incredulity just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it is n't true liars can be very pursuasive just look at koresh that you yourself site he has followers that do n't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die by not giving up after getting shot himself koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes as far as healing goes if i rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels in one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today seems to me that the early gospels were n't that compeling so the stories got bigger to appeal better niether was he a lunatic would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy very doubtful in fact rediculous for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away therefore since he was n't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing or might not have existed or any number of things that is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into there are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives however if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices i have given at least one valid alternative so the conclusion that jc is the real mccoy just because he is n't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid some other things to note he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in hrs alone this in his betrayal and crucifixion i do n't have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it jc was a rabbi he knew what those prophecies were it would n't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy what would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies and jc had absolutely no knowledge of then yet fullfilled them anyway i do n't think most people understand what a christian is it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god 's sake he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same hey we ca n't do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him that 's tuff and most people do n't want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time we do n't rush it in one day christianity is your whole life it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while we box everything into time units such as work at this time sports tv social life god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves here i agree with you anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously and what it says is that it must be a total way of life i have very little respect for xians that do n't if the myth is true then it is true in its entirity the picking and choosing that i see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth jim -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

1, perry dsinc.com jim perry subject re who says the apostles were tortured another article that fell between the cracks in article 1qiu97innpq6 srvr1.engin.umich.edu ingles engin.umich.edu ray ingles writes as evidence for the resurrection it is often claimed that the disciples were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce their claim that jesus had come back from the dead now i skimmed acts and such and i found a reference to this happening to stephen but no others where does this apparently very widely held belief come from is there any evidence outside the bible is there any evidence in the bible i sure have n't found any ... briefly no there is widespread folklore but no good documentary evidence or even solid rumor concerning the deaths of the apostles further the usual context of such arguments as you observe is `` no martyrs for a lie '' i.e the willingness of these people to die rather than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief this adds the quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered the chance of life by recanting since we do n't even know how or where they died we certainly do n't have this information by the way even in the case of stephen it is not at all clear that he could have saved himself by recanting the willingness of true believers to die for their belief be it in jesus or jim jones is well-documented so martyrdom in and of itself says little see 1kings18:20-40 for a biblical account of the martyrdom of priests of baal -- jim perry perry dsinc.com decision support inc. matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours

fred rice darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au in 1p8ivt cfj fido.asd.sgi.com livesey solntze.wpd.sgi.com jon livesey writes should we british go around blowing up skyscrapers next i do n't know if you are doing so but it seems you are implying that the person accused of blowing up the wtc in ny actually did it and that islamic teachings have something to do with blowing up the wtc wtc world trade centre which was the building that was blown up i think okay ... to make some comments ... the person has only been accused -- innocent until proven guilty remember secondly there seem to be some holes in his accusation that i read about for instance if they guy used that particular van to blow up the building and then to go back and claim his deposit back afterwards he must be incredibly stupid perhaps salamen was one of those `` uneducated '' muslims we hear so much about nevertheless he was apparently smart enough to put together a very sophisticated bomb it does n't seem to fit together somehow actually salameh was not the only person involved the other fellow was a chemical engineer working for allied signal who had specifically studied explosive devices in school believe it or not we actually allow radical muslim types to study things like this in our universities so much for the price of freedom what i read the other fellow told salameh how to put it together over the phone the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a i assume complicated sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ one must need some brains i would expect despite this there have already been many attacks and threats against mosques and muslims in the united states as a consequence of his accusation i have read o.k. now please tell us where this is happening i live in the u.s. and i have heard very little about these mosque attacks there are many mosques in houston texas and i would like to know what is going on so i can verify this or is the great jewish media conspiracy keeping us from knowing about this in the u.s. we heard about the mosque attacks during the desert storm venture so why is it so quiet now maybe it is localized to new jersey i read this in an article in `` the australian muslim times '' the newspaper weekly of the australian muslim community if this is true perhaps one of the muslims based in north america if they see this posting can elaborate islamic teachings teach against harming the innocent in the qur'an it explicitly teaches against harming innocents even in times of war the blowing up of the wtc and harming innocents is therefore in blatant contradiction to islamic teachings this means absolutely nothing plenty of people commit violence while following what they think are valid religious principles i have seen people post many things here from the koran which could be `` misinterpreted '' if that is the explanation you wish to use by an `` uneducated '' muslim to allow them to harm idolators and unbelievers the first thing every muslim says is that no muslim could have done that because islam teaches against harming innocents and we are supposed to take you word that it never happens what do you think is the consequence does allah strike them down before the `` alleged '' violence occurs of course not muslims commit the violent act and then everyone hides behind verses in the koran we're pretty hip to that trick and i even doubt that it will come up in the trials '' my defense is that i am muslim and islam teaches me not to harm the innocent therefore the people who were killed must not have been innocent sure we set off the bomb your honor but you must remember sir i am a muslim allah is all-powerful allah would not have allowed this are you insulting my religion '' great defense eh just admit that there are some incredibly stupid violent muslims in the world and stop hiding from that fact it does no one any good to deny it it only makes the more reasonable muslims look like they are protecting the bad ones can you see that i do n't deny this fact the thrust of my argument here is that a salameh is according to us law innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law as his guilt has not been established it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption b islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents if muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that islam teaches this -- perform such actions it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of islam but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the teachings of islam this is an important distinction i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say `` muslim '' in general anyone who calls themselves a `` muslim '' and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam is considered to be a muslim thus one who might do things contrary to islam through ignorance for example does not suddenly _not_ become a muslim if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential principles though then one does leave islam the term `` muslim '' is to be contrasted with `` mu'min '' which means `` true believer '' however whether a muslim is in reality a mu'min is something known only by god and perhaps that person himself so you will not find the term mu'min used very much by muslims in because it is not known to anybody except myself and god whether i for example am a `` true believer '' or not for example i could just be putting on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what i write here without anyone knowing thus when we say `` muslims '' we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress islamic teachings by '' muslim '' we do not necessarily mean `` mu'min '' or `` true believer '' in islam fred rice darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au

-- -- -- -- stauber disturbed by third-man theme by rick sadowski daily news barry melrose 's decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender `` i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most fun time of the year and i 'm not '' stauber said with some emotion monday `` i think i have worked hard enough for that '' stauber said he accepts melrose 's choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the calgary flames hrudey made saves in sundays 6-3 opening victory but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no man behind rick knickle stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no job from hrudey knickle he won of decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average twice was yanked from games once for stomach cramps and has n't played since march yet when the series resumes wednesday knickle will serve as hrudey 's backup again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic saddledome popcorn `` if i 'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter ... i dropped too what happened to no '' stauber wondered `` not that i 'd be happy with no but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs '' perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance but melrose apparently is not convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure while insisting he is the kings `` goalie of the future '' melrose said stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season they were according to melrose a 7-2 loss to san jose on dec. an 8-3 loss to the new york rangers on jan. a 6-6 tie with detroit on feb. an 8-6 loss to vancouver on thursday `` four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could have taken it away from kelly hrudey and he did n't do it '' melrose said `` an elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him the mark of a great goalie is that he is n't satisfied to be a backup '' `` i 'm not blaming robb for the losses but if you 're going to be no you've got to be able to walk your talk you 've got to be able to play when everything is on the line robb stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe i expect more from him than he does '' ouch that remark stung stauber he began the season 9-0-1 struggled when the team hit a mid-season slump did n't play for a month after knickle was signed off the san diego gulls roster then came on at the end `` i expect more from myself than anybody including barry melrose '' said stauber a three-year star at the university of minnesota who left school in only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries `` what i 've been through the last four years two knee operations a herniated disk in my back shoulder surgery what more can i go through i obviously do expect a lot from myself otherwise i would n't be here '' `` anybody who would disagree with that does n't know me i 'm not saying barry does n't know me but do n't say i 've been without expectations if anything i'm a perfectionist '' stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned `` but even though i did n't play well i get knocked down from maybe on to three it 's a bit of a jump '' he said `` you 're almost no or if you play a good game you 're no and if you do n't you 're no why does jack nicklaus shoot a and then a can you explain that that 's what barry wanted me to explain to him why i did n't come through when he counted on me i do n't know what i do know is it 's a sport i 'll be there ''

12, document_id from caronni nessie.cs.id.ethz.ch germano caronni subject re more technical details hmm followup on my own posting ... well who cares first let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the clipper-chip from what hellman and denning were able to tell us the chip itself is not confined to digital telephony but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner the chip supports cfb ofb ecb and whatever the fourth mode of operation for des is the algorithm consists of rounds of whatever and takes 80-bit keys input data seems to be bit yes so if two people want secure communication whatever that means when clipper is involved they have first to agree on one secret key or is it one key per direction they can exchange this key via dh-schemes or however somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the clipper-chip which is now ready to work the clipper chip carries an unique serial-number bit 's and key-bits these key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with seed-bits the seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip at beginning of communication and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the clipper chip put 's out packets i guess which represent the serial number and the session key this might look like x e k chipkeyk1+k2 serial number where x is a transformation of these packets involving a family-key this family sp -key is equal for all chips x might be a simple xor after that the digital phone-call can be done as usual every packet being encrypted and decrypted by clipper denning describes how k1 and k2 shall be generated using a seed of bit 's now leaving alone politics which does not concern me as much as you not being an american citicien tm there are some weak points in this scheme which might be exploited by several parties as far as i know about the generation of k1 k2 s1 and s2 look like the obvious backdoor they could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number and also the family-key of the chip i really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise as true random-sources for the generation of the k1 k2 can be bought for not to much money then the escrows each of them will get bit of a 160-bit key security could as little as existant be maximized by giving them 160-bits each which have to be xored together to give the k1 k2 now let 's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy and ca n't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies and there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties and so on and so on once the keys are surrendered the corresponding chip is compromised forever not very clever imho how about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police or whoever want 's to listen to escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police and would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired ... this would be a better technical solution but i guess politics will not work that way apparently as miss dennings stated the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the fbi great so local guys can not inter- cept understand your traffic anymore does this mean that the fbi monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps how is law over there i have no idea who is allowed to tap and who not this certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the fbi if the communicaiton is a watched one and this means as far as i understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc so the family-key will not be very secret and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares i _like_ traffic-analysis what do you guess what happens if you use the chip in ecb mode and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled so the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line hmmm should n't be so difficult to do that and now a last point for the other side after all i have read and heard about clipper not the programming language for dbase is it it seems to have many advantages which shold not be overseen now an afterthought to your rights please note that i have no idea what i am talking about from grady netcom.com 1016/2ef221 amendment congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise

12," document_id from denning guvax.acc.georgetown.edu subject revised technical summary of clipper chip here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors and provides some additional information and explanation the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning revised april introduction on april the president announced a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement at the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the `` clipper chip '' together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key chip contents the clipper chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called `` skipjack '' the algorithm uses bit keys compared with for the des and has rounds of scrambling compared with for the des it supports all des modes of operation the algorithm takes clock ticks and in electronic codebook ecb mode runs at mbits per second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips n a 30-bit serial number this length is subject to change u an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip the chips are programmed by mykotronx inc. which calls them the '' myk-78 '' the silicon is supplied by vlsi technology inc they are implemented in micron technology and will initially sell for about each in quantities of 10,000 or more the price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at t telephone security device as it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key k with the device at the other end this key negotiation takes place without the clipper chip in general any method of key exchange can be used such as the diffie-hellman public-key distribution method once the session key k is established the clipper chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitized voice the telephone security device feeds k and m into the chip to produce two values e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which are transmitted over the telephone line the law enforcement field thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n all encrypted under the family key f. the law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed the ciphertext e m k is decrypted by the receiver 's device using the session key d e m k k m chip programming and escrow all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif secure compartmented information facility which is essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about chips are programmed during a single session the scif is located at mykotronx at the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent enters a secret random 80-bit value s1 into the laptop and agent enters a secret random 80-bit value s2 these random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers thus the unit keys are a function of secret random bits where each agent knows only to generate the unit key for a serial number n the 30-bit value n is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block n1 s1 and s2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt n1 producing a 64-bit block r1 r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1 similarly n is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce n2 and n3 and two additional 64-bit blocks r2 and r3 are computed r2 e d e n2 s1 s2 s1 r3 e d e n3 s1 s2 s1 r1 r2 and r3 are then concatenated together giving bits the first bits are assigned to u1 and the second bits to u2 the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u1 and u2 u1 and u2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies as a sequence of values for u1 u2 and u are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u1 the second disk is similar but contains the u2 values the third disk contains the unit keys u agent takes the first disk and agent takes the second disk thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts however the agent does not know the other bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seeds s1 and s2 and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the clipper chip the law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key f giving e k u n. documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number n is then sent e.g. via secure fax to each of the key escrow agents who return e.g. also via secure fax u1 and u2 u1 and u2 are xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u is decrypted to get the session key k. finally the message stream is decrypted all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder capstone the next generation a successor to the clipper chip called `` capstone '' by the government and `` myk-80 '' by mykotronx has already been developed it will include the skipjack algorithm the digital signature standard dss the secure hash algorithm sha a method of key exchange a fast exponentiator and a randomizer a prototoype will be available for testing on april and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in june or july acknowledgment and distribution notice this

13, document_id from schmidt auvax1.adelphi.edu subject grounding power wiring was re a question about 120vac outlet wiring there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here a few points need to be clarified the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects it should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation `` orange '' outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems the code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either the grounded conductor of a circuit often called the neutral which is referred to in the code as the `` identified '' conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel this connection is through the main bonding jumper in many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor in the case of a volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions if you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end if the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the `` u '' ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential the difference under normal non short-circuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two this normally does not present a shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path if the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat with the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling this is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the `` hot '' conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy do n't flame me on this i 'm just telling you where the field comes from not it 's health effect as far as i 'm concerned the jury is still out on this note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at any sub distribution panels this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before u ground outlets and such the appliance manufacturers do n't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors do n't want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the volt `` hots '' except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings it 's primarily for lightning protection people doing wiring should be aware what is and what is n't a legal grounding conductor obviously the bare wire in `` romex '' 'with ground is anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you do n't have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes `` greenfield '' looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is not a legal grounding conductor as it does n't have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield `` wiremold '' is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the `` feed '' to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were `` hot '' with volts why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can `` bond '' the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should ground the green wire/lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it the interrupter does n't depend on the ground to trip it is desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path for those questioning the legal use of

'' chances are good that if you watched '60 minutes last november 3rd you came away feeling msg is bad for you ... in the segment entitled 'no msg for instance show host ed bradley makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them 'millions are suffering a host of symptoms and some get violently sick peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven personal testimony ... and speaks of studies on msg that make the substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive those studies are consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to a study conducted at the eastern virginia medical school in order to back up his comment that there is a lot of evidence that msg a flavor enhancer in chinese and other asian cuisines as well as in many supermarket items causes headaches what he does not make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on humans but on rabbits one of the researchers who conducted the study pharmacologist patricia williams ph.d. says it certainly is conceivable that a small minority of people are sensitive enough to msg to get headaches from it 'but she explains 'the show probably overemphasized the extent of the problem a second lapse comes with mention of dr. john olney a professor at the washington university school of medicine who mr. bradley remarks 'says that his years of research with laboratory animals shows msg is a hazard for developing youngsters because it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage dr. olney's research with lab animals does not 'show anything about human youngsters in fact only under extreme circumsrtances did dr. olney 's experiments ever bring about any brain damage when he injected extremely high doses of msg into rodents completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance to very young animals on an empty stomach of course neither of those procedures occurs with humans they simply take in msg with food and most of what they take in is broken down by enzymes in the wall of the small intestine so that very little reaches the bloodstream -- much to little in fact for human blood levels of msg to come anywhere near the high concentrations found in dr. olney 's lab animals ..... the world health organization appears to be very much aware of that fact and so does the european communities scientific committee for food .... both after examining numerous studies have concluded that msg is safe their determination makes sense considering that msg has never been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed to it -- headaches swelling a tightness in the chest and a burning sensation among others in fact the most fail-safe of clinical studies the double-blind study ... has consistently exonerated the much-maligned substance that 's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of monosodium glutamate glutamate enters our systems whenever we eat any food that contains protein the reason is that one of the amino acids that make up protein glutamic acid is broken down into glutamate during digestion it 's a breakdown that occurs frequently glutamic acid is the most abundant of the or so amino acids in the diet it makes up about percent of the protein in flesh foods percent in milk percent in corn and percent in whole wheat that does n't mean it 's entirely unimaginable that a small number of people have trouble metabolizing msg properly and are therefore sensitive to it ... the consensus reached by large international professional organizations is that msg is safe the same consensus reached by the fda and the biomedical community at large '' -rich young these are not kodak 's opinions

15," document_id from jbh55289 uxa.cso.uiuc.edu josh hopkins subject rimsat us/russian joint venture i 've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest i 've transcribed some of my notes below since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine permission is granted to copy this without restriction michael sternberg cheif of operations of rimsat was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control disarmament and international security rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launchers and satellites i think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the international relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson went to tonga to visit a friend while he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king who happened to be a big tv fan matt bought the king a satellite dish which the king thought was really nifty since tonga has a gnp of about million his majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this matt thought there probably was so at his suggestion tonga applied for geosynchronous satellite slots while this is n't entirely off the wall it was very unusual seeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and is a lot of slots the whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions supporting tonga 's case eventually tonga ended up with slots ranging from e to e slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside according to sternberg four of these from e to e are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat was formed to use these slots it was officially formed in nevis as a tax haven they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to fill slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately billion it 's not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh terms that i do n't think i 'll visit there for a long time besides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way that people operate for example `` everybody can sell you everything '' everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for satellites at a cost of million however glavkosmos lost favor after the coup sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures since glavkosmos was out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms eventually he worked out a deal and on dec he met with koptev who heads the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat the next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware npo applied mechanics -- npo pm to use their acronym this organization is located in siberia ca n't figure out how to spell the town i need an atlas and has built about vehicles since the dawn of the space age sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites they are hard workers honest people who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners at this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners sternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm his company is apparently lookng for million to invest in the firm to become partners.it apparently costs the russians about million to build a satellite that would sell for million in the west if you want to give them specifications they 'll build you a satellite for the particular satellites that rimsat will be using costs run about 378,000 per transponder year this compares to 810,000 t/y in the u.s they can sell their time for about 1.1 million compared to 2.6 million in the u.s. rimsat will launch their satellites on protons to get the best prices they bought in bulk they have the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians which is being moved into place now tidbits sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big business because big business is just like what they have over there except that `` we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier '' russian launches are self insured the promise to replace a failed launch within months major investors in rimsat include russell 20/20 which is a huge retirement fund organization cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast asia and a fund operated by some of the big names in u.s aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off he downplayed the instabilites in the ex-ussr saying that we are worried partly because we are n't used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying monolith italy gets a new government `` every two weeks '' but we do n't worry because we 're used to it he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in russia we wo n't worry about their stability as much part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting in their coffers and replacing the rest with the `` equivalent '' value in rubles to get around this rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites which was rather reassuring the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the older gorizont horizon satellites have a lifetime of about years while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about years while this is much shorter than years for western satellites sternberg downplayed the difference at these prices they can afford to launch new ones in addition shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date hardware -- josh hopkins jbh55289 uxa.cso.uiuc.edu `` find a way or make one ''

15," document_id from eder hsvaic.boeing.com dani eder subject re guns for space okay lets get the record straight on the livermore gas gun the project manager is dr. john hunter and he works for the laser group at livermore what you may ask does gas guns have to do with lasers nothing really but the gun is physically located across the road from the free electron laser building and the fel building has a heavily shielded control room thick walls from which the gun firings are controlled so i suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience i visited hunter at the beginning of feb. and we toured the gun at the time i was working on gas gun r d at boeing where i work but i am now doing other things helping to save the space station the gun uses a methane-air mixture which is burned in a chamber about ft long by inch id i.e it looks like a pipe the chamber holds a ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber on the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres the piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures at around 50,000 psi the barrel of the gun is about feet long and has a inch bore it is mounted at right angles to the chamber i.e they intersect this was done so that in the future the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber the projectile being used in testing is a kg cylinder of lexan plastic in in diameter and about cm long all of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel the barrel is evacuated and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film a little thicker than saran wrap the plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile the gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs in the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found at the higher speeds in later testing the projectile vaporizes the testing is into a bunker because the livermore test range is about miles across and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range the intent is to move the whole gun to vandenberg afb after the testing is complete where they can fire into the pacific ocean and use the tracking radar at vafb to follow the projectiles the design goal of the gun is to throw a kg projectile at km/s half of orbital speed so far they have reached km/s and the gun is currently down for repairs as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware i think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning but i have n't had a chance to talk to hunter directly on this there are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air at mach 12= km/s since the most you can get in wind tunnels is mach this gun cost about million to develop and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space this would require on the order of kg projectiles which deliver on the order of kg useful payload to orbit dani eder -- dani eder/meridian investment company/ 464-2697 w /232-7467 h rt.1 box 188-2 athens al 35611/location 34deg n 86deg w +100m alt"

apr.29.04.19.17.1993.9069 geneva.rutgers.edu sun075 gerry.palo uunet.uu.net gerry palo writes note that in this perhaps the oldest of the creeds there is no mention of the danger of hell for non-believers likewise there is no mention of the salvation of the believers soul and its destiny in heaven after death there is only the resurrection of the body and it does not say when or how you do n't go far enough back if we believe in god and that he did create the heavens and the earth and he did create adam and eve and that they walked in the garden and history flowed from there if we can agree with that then would you agree that the further back you go the closer you get to people who had a stronger memory of who god was and what he said and commanded between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred this involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world this is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history the greek for example could say `` better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead '' iliad i think the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is an ever present one with christians i am not ready to conscign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation yet they all died in their sins in the christian sense the same can be said of the whole of gentile humanity and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him i do not limit the power of christ to save even him through whom satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment in my studies of the ancient mystery reliegions i have run across many poems or rituals or what nots with the interpretation that those who are of god will be with him via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer eternal life in dieing it was a standard belief back then it is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment the relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of greenwich mean time it is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss or even many of them in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth it was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost this again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people 's ideas of life after death today we think we know so much and that if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two but i think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a mist not those of the older ages mankind fell into mist and darkness and at `` the turning point of time '' a new light entered into the world the light still grows and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us our new vision and understanding is still very feeble but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well at this point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insights that have led me to my views on this subject i have said it before i 'd love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would fall the history to purgatory can be shown from the druids in england to the greeks who pilaged it from the egyptians who ultimately got it from the babylonian mysteries and yes the eastern religions also show many similarities i mean its black and white the writings and the archeological finds plainly show its origin and the whys and wherefores of this doctine the way you refer to it as `` doctrine '' puts a modern intellectual coloring on it i think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received i am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they were passed on the question is to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people 's ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality in any case we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of euclid but by contemplating the principles themselves on the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is created at birth was consciously adopted from aristotle whose ideas dominated christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today he was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim maybe at sometime in the future- indeed i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment i.e after the

=============================================== the ahmadiyya movement in islam an international organi- sation was found in in qadian india the founder of this movement hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad 1835-1908 was proclaimed to be the promised reformer of this age as foretold in the scriptures of almost all major religions of the world he claimed to be the fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of jesus christ metaphorically the muslim mahdi and the promised messiah the claims of hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition which are often witnessed in the history of divine reformers even today this sect is being persecuted especial- ly in some of the muslim regimes the right of ahmadi muslims to openly practice their religion and to define themselves as muslims has been severely restricted in many muslim countries the united nations human rights organizations such as amnesty international and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the members of this movement but so far to no avail despite the opposition and persecution the movement cont- inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the world in over countries who come from diverse ethnic and cul- tural backgrounds the movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards developing a better understanding of all religions ahmadi muslims have always been opposed to all forms of violence bigotry reli- gious intolerance and fundamentalism among its many philanthropic activities the sect has es- tablished a network of hundreds of schools hospitals and clinics in many third world countries these institutions are staffed by volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's internal resources the movement stresses the importance of educa- tion and leadership its members have included a high number of professionals as well as world class individuals the

16, document_id from af664 yfn.ysu.edu frank decenso jr. subject major views of the trinity with frank 's permission i have added some information here and in one case changed the order of his contributions in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views my comments are based primarily on william rusch 's historical summary in `` the trinitarian controversy '' fortress i 'm going to save this as an faq -- clh major views of the trinity second century the writers of the 2nd cent are important because they set up much of the context for the later discussions justin martyr aristides athenagoras tatian and theophilus of antioch are known as the '' apologists '' their theology has often been described as `` logos theology '' based strongly on wording in john they took more or less a two-phase approach through eternity the logos was with the father as his mind or thought this `` immanent word '' became '' expressed '' as god revealed himself in history ultimately in jesus thus jesus full distinction from the father only became visible in history though the logos had been present in god from eternity rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position but in a form which is less sophisticated because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the godhead irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the apologists however he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach he still viewed god as one personage with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation the `` economy '' the distinctions are present in his essential nature irenaeus emphasized the holy spirit more than the apologists irenaeus views should probably be called `` economic trinitarianism '' though that term is normally used as below to refer to later developments third century -- clh dynamic monarchianism source theodotus adherents paul of samosota artemon socinus modern unitarians perception of god 's essence the unity of god denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person the son and the holy spirit therefore are consubstantial with the father 's divine essence only as impersonal attributes the divine dunamis came upon the man jesus but he was not god in the strict sense of the word perception of god 's subsistence the notion of a subsistent god is a palpable impossibility since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible the 'diversity of god is apparent and not real since the christ event and the work of the holy spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within god not to a hypostatic union asignation of deity/eternality father unique originator of the universe he is eternal self-existent and without beginning or end son a virtuous but finite man in whose life god was dynamically present in a unique way christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified holy spirit an impersonal attribute of the godhead no deity or eternality is ascribed to the holy spirit criticism s elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the trinity categorically denies the deity of christ and of the holy spirit thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation in summary this probably best thought of as not being trinitarianism at all god is an undifferentiated one son and holy spirit are seen as simply names for the man jesus and the grace of god active in the church -- clh modalistic monarchianism source praxeas adherents noatus sabellius swedenborg scleiermacher united pentecostals jesus only perception of god 's essence the unity of god is ultra-simplex he is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person this essence may be designated interchangeably as father son and holy spirit they are different names for but identical with the unified simplex god the three names are the three modes by which god reveals himself perception of god 's subsistence the concept of a subsistent god is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of god 's modalistic manifesting of himself the paradox of a subsisting `` three in oneness '' is refuted by recognizing that god is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama asignation of deity/eternality father fully god and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary god son full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one god and identical with his essence he is the same god manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role incarnation holy spirit eternal god only as the tile designates the phase in which the one god in temporal sequence manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification criticism s depersonalizes the godhead to compensate for its trinitarian deficiencies this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical its concept of successive manifestations of the godhead can not account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at christ 's baptism rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy there are actually two slightly different groups included noetus and his followers and sabellius noetus was apparently more extreme sabellius followed him and attempted to use some features of economic trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view unfortunately information about sabellius comes from a century later and there seems to be some confusion between him and marcellus of ancyra -- clh i 've moved the following description to be with the other third-century views it originally appeared near the end -- clh '' economic '' trinitarianism source hippolytus tertullian adherents various `` neo-economic '' trinitarians perception of god 's essence the godhead is characterized by triunity father son and holy spirit are the three manifestations of one identical indivisible substance the perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest triadic deeds as creation and redemption perception of god 's subsistence subsistence within the godhead is articulated by means of such terms as `` distinction '' and `` distribution '' dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division asignation of deity/eternality the equal deity of father son and holy spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the godhead co-eternality at times does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view but it seems to be a logical implication criticism s is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the trinity note that this is a development of the apologists and irenaeus as mentioned above as with them the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that god revealed himself in history however they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the godhead from the beginning tertullian talks of the father son and holy spirit as being three that are one in substance many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox but with less developed philosophical categories -- clh origen developing further an approach started by clement attempted to apply neo-platonism to christian thought he set many of the terms of the coming battle in platonic fashion he sees the son as a mediator mediating between the absolute one of god and the plurality of creating beings the son is generated but he is `` eternally generated '' that is the relationship between father and son is eternal it can not be said that `` there was once when he was not '' a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries having the son is intrinsic to his concept of god the father and son are described as separate `` hypostases '' though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts the union is one of love and action but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios `` of the same substance '' the holy spirit is also an active personal substance originated by the father through the son origen 's intent is trinitarian not tritheistic but he pushes things in the direction of separateness fourth century -- clh subordinationism often called arianism -- clh source arius major adherents modern jehovah 's witnesses and several other lesser known cults perception of god 's essence the inherent oneness of god 's nature is properly identifiable with the father only the son and the holy spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence perception of god 's subsistence the unipersonal essence of god precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a godhead `` threeness in oneness '' is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic god asignation of deity/eternality father the only one unbegotten god who is eternal and without beginning son a created being and therefore not eternal though he is to be venerated he is not of the divine essence holy spirit a nonpersonal noneternal emanation of the father he is viewed as an influence an expression of god deity is not ascribed to him criticism s it is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both christ and the holy spirit its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the father christ and the holy spirit this results in a totally confused soteriology note also that in most versions of this view the son is not fully human either he is supernatural and sinless that distinguishes this view from adoptionism -- clh orthodox trinitarianism source athanasius adherents basil gregory of nyssa gregory of nazianzus augustine thomas aquinas luther calvin contemporary orthodox christianity perception of god 's essence god 's being is perfectly unified and simplex of one essence this essence of deity is held in common by father son and holy spirit the three persons are consubstantial coinherent co-equal and co- eternal perception of god 's subsistence the divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases as such the godhead exists `` undivided in divided persons '' this view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the godhead asignation of deity/eternality in its final distillation this view unhesitatingly sets forth father son and holy spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function criticism s the only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of `` three in oneness '' at least in the 4th cent there were several different approaches all of which fit the description here and all regarded as orthodox but which are somewhat different in detail nicea was originally held to respond to arius arius can be thought of as carrying origen 's thought a bit too far to the point of making the son a separate entity in general the east tended to take an approach based on origen 's and it was hard to get acceptance of nicea in the east its final acceptance was based on the work of athanasius with the cappadocians gregory of nyssa and gregory of nazianzus among others while starting with three they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single god this allowed the council of constantinople in to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia --

16, document_id from dlecoint garnet.acns.fsu.edu darius_lecointe subject re sabbath admissions 5of5 someone sent me this faq by e-mail and i post my response here i 'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this faq because most of our readers probably have n't seen it -- clh christ warns that anyone who `` breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven '' matt 5:19 this faq is so full of error that i must respond to it i hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology brothers and sisters being new to the faith and examining the decalogue closely i 've noticed the fourth commandment is pretty specific about `` keeping the sabbath day '' it states the 7th day saturday is the sabbath while most christian religions keep or atleast go to church on sunday what 's up this is a frequently asked question every time it arises it causes months of debate so let me see if i can answer you directly basically it 's because the law was given to moses as part of a specific covenanent with the jews most of us are n't jews so we are n't part of that covenant there was an argument early in christian history about whether the mosaic laws should apply to gentiles who became christians you can see the account of this debate in acts the main question there was circumcision but keeping the sabbath would be part of it as well the apostles concluded that we need not become jews in order to become christians and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount sinai rom 4:15 notes that `` where no law is there is no transgression '' not only did sin exist before sinai eden but the sabbath was kept before it was revealed on sinai ex the problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promise which undergirded it god wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people but in their ignorance after years of slavery they promised '' what ever he says to do we will do '' that is why the new covenant is based on `` better promises '' heb 8:6 rather than do away with the law god promised to `` put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts '' heb 8:10 including the sabbath in the acts is selective inclusion the sabbath was more important to the jews than circumcision if any attempt had been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in acts do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law ceremonial which was added because of transgression of the moral law gal 3:19 israel stands for god 's people of all time that is why god grafted the gentiles in roma 9:4 says that the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of god and the promises belong to israelites in explanation paul makes it clear that being born into israel is not enough `` for they are not all israel which are of israel '' v then in gal 3:19 he says `` if ye be christ 's then are ye abraham 's seed and heirs according to the promise '' all christians are abraham 's seed jews israelites not physically for that is not the criterion but spiritually we are joint heirs with jesus based on the promise god made to all his people the israelites while christians agree that the ot laws do not all apply to us because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the jews we also expect to see some similarity between the things god expected from the jews and the things he expects from us after all it 's the same god however there are several ways of dealing with this these days the most common approach is to separate the ot commandments into `` moral '' and `` ceremonial '' ceremonial commandments apply only to the jews they are part of the specific mosaic covenant these are thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision moral laws apply to everyone most of the commands are part of the moral law except for the commandment about the sabbath i believe most people who take this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on the sabbath is part of the ceremonial law but a general obligation to worship regularly is part of the general moral law thus christians are free to choose the specific time we worship people would probably agree but they are wrong how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws you are not free to choose your time of worship even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship would you rather give up a day which god blessed sanctified and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation see sabbath admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study a more radical approach which is generally connected with john calvin and the reformed tradition says that the law as a whole is no longer binding instead we are entirely under grace and our behavior should be guided solely by love portions of the ot law are still useful as guidance but they are not properly speaking legally binding on us in practice most people who take this position do not believe it is safe to leave christians without moral guidannce while we may no longer be under law as sinners it 's not safe for us to go into situations with no principles to guide us we 're too good at self-justification for that to be safe thus christians do have moral guidance from things like jesus teachings paul 's advice etc these may not be precisely a law but they serve much the same function as and have largely the same content as the `` moral law '' in the previous analysis while calvin would deny that we have a fixed legal responsibility to worship on any specific day he would say that given human weakness the discipline of regular worship is important i do not care what calvin or any theologian says my guide is what god says if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the sabbath commandment which is the only one god thought was important enough to say remember if you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of god if a cop pulls me over for speeding then in court i ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace do i walk out of the court saying `` i can now go on speeding for i am now under grace '' being under grace i now drive within the speed limit paul adds to it in rom 3:31 `` di we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law '' `` wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good '' rom 7:12 in both analyses the specific day is not an issue as a matter of tradition we worship on sunday as a memorial of christ's resurrection there 's some debate about what acts shows about early christian worship the most common analysis is that is shows jewish christians continuing to go to jewish services on the sabbath but that specifically christian service were not necessarily held then act 20:7 shows worship on the first day sunday and i cor 16:2 also implies gatherings on that day there are a few groups that continue to believe christians have to worship on the sabbath saturday the best-known are the seventh-day adventists and jehovah 's witnesses they argue that act 20:7 is not a regular worship service but a special meeting to see paul off and that i cor 16:2 does n't explicitly say it 's a regular worship service do you prefer implication to fact a careful study of the acts shows that the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul did not go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot to assos in icor there is no way you can equate `` lay by him in store '' with `` go to a worship service '' it 's clear that this issue was a contested one in paul 's time see rom 14:5 paul 's advice is that we should be very careful about judging each other on issues like this one person sees a specific day as mandated by god while another does not he who observes that specific day does it in honor of the lord he who believes his worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the lord those who believe that the sabbath is still mandated argue that paul is not referring to sabbath worship here note however col 2:16 which says something similar but briefer it explicitly mentions sabbath wrong these are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law not the sabbath day of the moral law there are some differences among christians about use of the word `` sabbath '' originally the term referred to the 7th day the jewish day of worship many christians now use it to refer to sunday the day of christian worship they do this largely so that they can apply the 4th or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering schemes commandment to it reformed tradition does not do this it distinguishes between the sabbath -- which is the observance mandated for jews and the lord 's day -- which is the free christian worship the only reference i can find to this in the nt is rev 1:10 there are also differences about laws regarding this day many christians support `` blue laws '' both in secular law and church law setting aside that day and causing people to spend it in worship the more radical anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the jewish sabbath which is not appropriate to the free christian worship of the lord 's day why would you prefer to twist and turn relying on different arguments which conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from a god who loved you enough to die for you jesus died because the law could not be changed why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable that is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws it will always be a sin to make false gods to violate god 's name to break the sabbath to steal to kill etc except it you disagree but then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of god darius it 's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq i think paul 's comments on esteeming one day over another rom is probably all that needs to be said i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who `` esteem all days alike '' are similarly doing their best to honor the lord however i 'd like to be clear that i do not think there 's unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says `` and they gathered every sunday for worship '' we get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this question act 2:26 describes christians as participating both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion services in homes obviously the temple worship is on the sabbath acts 13:44 is an example of christians participating in them unfortunately it does n't tell us what day christians met in their houses acts 20:7 despite darius' confusion is described by acts as occuring on sunday i see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start when the biblical text is clear about what was meant the wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting it does n't say they gathered to see paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread paul talked about his upcoming travel but that 's just not explicit enough to be really convincing similarly with cor 16:2 it says that on the first day they should set aside money for paul's collection now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this or that they did it in their homes i ca n't disprove it but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day so i think the most obvious reading of this is that `` on the first day of every week '' simply means every time they gather for worship i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was -- clh

16, document_id from johnsd2 rpi.edu dan johnson subject re the arrogance of christians in article geneva.rutgers.edu gt7122b prism.gatech.edu boundary writes dleonar andy.bgsu.edu pixie writes deletia- sig p.s if you do sincerely believe that a god exists why do you follow it blindly do the words `` question authority '' mean anything to you i defy any theist to reply deletia- formalities i probably should let this pass it 's not worth the time and it 's not really intended for me but i could n't resist a personal weakness of mine jerkius kneeus tragically incurable the foundation for faith in god is reason without which the existence of god could not be proven that his existence can be proven by reason is indisputable cf my short treatise `` traditional proofs for the existence of god '' and summa theologica not so i can prove that the existance of god is disputable by showing that people dispute it this is easy i dispute that god exists simple i missed your `` traditional proofs '' treatise but the proofs i remember from the summa theologic the ways i think it was were rather poor stuff the ontological argument is about a billion times better imho i would think you 'd want non-traditional proofs considering the general failure of the traditional proofs at least the ones i know of i am thinking of the ontological argument the cosmological argument and the teleological argument those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names anyway now given that god exists and that his existence can be proven by reason i assert that his commands must be followed blindly although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith why this is the real question so to discuss it i 'll assume god exists otherwise there is no heavenly authority to babble about because god is the first cause of all things the first mover of matter the independent thing that requires nothing else for its existence the measure of all that is perfect and the essential being who gives order to the universe logos please show this is the case i am familiar with the first cause argument and i 'll accept for the sake of argument that there is a first cause even though i find some of its premices questionable the rest you 'll have to show this includes that the first cause is god i next assert that god is all good got it i deny that god is all good so there if this is so then that which is contrary to the will of god is evil i.e. the absence of the good and since god can never contradict himself then by his promise of a savior as early as the protoevangelium of genesis 3:5 god instructs that because a human adam was first responsible for man 's alienation from the source of all good a man would be required to act to restore the friendship thus god became incarnate in the person of the messiah this is n't self-consistent if humans must renew the relationship then god incarnate or not ca n't do it well unless you think god is human granted god made himself 'human but this is nonetheless cheating the intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused god fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this now this messiah claimed that he is the truth john 14:6 if this claim is true then we are bound by reason to follow him who is truth incarnate why also why assume said claim is true anyway if i claim to be truth are you bound by reason to follow me you next seem to have a problem with authority have you tried the united states marine corps yet i can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority undoubtably do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the marines without question you seem to imply this about god and that the marines are similar in this respect .. if this is not what you are trying to say they please explain what it is you are saying as i have missed it if you have not yet had the privilege i will reply that the authority which is truth incarnate may never be questioned and thus must be followed blindly why why not question it even if it is truth we can not know this certainly so why is it so irrational to question perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong you assert that god is truth and we ca n't question truth but i assert that god is not truth and anyway we can question truth how is it my assertion is less good than yours one may not deny the truth oh i hereby deny 1+1=2 i hope you 'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth granted i look pretty damn silly saying something like that but i needed something we 'd both agree was clearly true now you 'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag no heaven lighting bolts either no mysterious net outages i seem to be permited to say such things absurd or not for example when the proverbial apple fell on isaac newton 's head he could have denied that it happened but he did not the laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not they are true they are certainly not true at least the ones newton derived are not true and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances we do not have a set of laws of physics that always works in all cases if we did physics would be over already science is all about questioning this sort of truth if we did n't we 'd still follow aristotle i 'd generalize this a little more if you want to learn anything new you must question the things you know tm because you can always be wrong therefore the authority which is truth may not be denied even presupposing that truth may not be denied and may not be questioned and that god is truth it only follows that god may not be denied or questioned not that he must be obeyed we could unquestioningly disobey him how annoying of us but you have not connected denial with disobedience -- dan `` no nickname '' johnson and god said `` jeeze this is dull '' ... and it was dull genesis 0:0 these opinions probably show

16, document_id from jasons atlastele.com jason smith subject re atheist 's views on christianity was re `` accepting jeesus in your heart ... '' in article apr.19.05.13.48.1993.29266 athos.rutgers.edu kempmp phoenix.oulu.fi petri pihko writes jason smith jasons atlastele.com wrote the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all one of the laws of nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate at least to this layman 's mind there must be a causal event no reasonable alternative exists i would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime causes precede their effects and i must concede here cause before effect implies time time is part of spacetime hense the argument would be valid i could return and say that this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being unique to this spacetime but i wo n't 8^ because the point is moot doesn't address why which petri pikho addresses below i also concede that i was doubly remiss as i asserted `` no reasonable alternative exists '' an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated given time and further discovery by the scientist i also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily specify that `` this is how it happened '' but proposes a likely description of the phenomena in question am i mistaken with this understanding but if you claim that there must be an answer to `` how '' did the universe our spacetime emerge from `` nothing '' science has some good candidates for an answer all of which require something we christians readily admit to `` faith '' the fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive with out conclusive evidence we are left with faith it could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven as best as a non-repeatable event can be `` proven '' but i ask what holds someone today to the belief that any or all of them are correct except by faith a couple of paragraphs deleted summary we ask `` why does the universe exist '' i think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question however is it a meaningful question after all i would say it is n't consider the following apparently it is for many persons hence we have religions the question `` why anything exists '' can be countered by demanding answer to a question `` why there is nothing in nothingness or in non-existence '' actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that do n't exist do n't exist tautology at its best carefully examine the original question and then the `` counter-question '' the first asks `` why '' while the second is a request for definition it does n't address why something does or does not exist but asks to define the lack of existence the second question is unanswerable indeed for how do we identify something as `` nothing '' are n't they mutually exclusive terms how do we identify a state of non-existence again this is nearing the limits of this simple layman 's ability to comprehend and i would appreciate an explanation i might add the worldview of `` things that exist do and things that do n't ... do n't '' is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable as does the theist 's belief in god it is based on the assumption that there is not a reason for being something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there being a reason its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is a reason we come to this either `` i am therefore i am `` or `` i am for a reason '' if the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not a doctor if the latter your search is just beginning i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question time will tell 8^ some christians i have talked to have said that actually god is himself the existence however i see several problems with this answer first it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is actually _all_ existence good and evil devils and angels us and them this is pantheism not christianity agreed it would lead me to question their definition of christianity as well another answer is that god is the _source_ of all existence this sounds much better but i am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this does not preclude his existence it only seeks to identify his qualities implying he exists to have qualities btw the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions being an atheist myself i do not accept such answers since i do not have any other methods like the theist we come to a statement of faith for this position assumes that the evidence at hand is conclusive note i am not arguing against scientific endeavor for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist but i differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective i seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the creator i also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer `` why '' it appears that m. pihko agrees as we shall see but because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question asserting that 'why is an invalid question does not provide an answer as far as i can tell the very laws of nature demand a `` why '' that isn't true of something outside of nature i.e. super natural this is not true science is a collection of models telling us `` how '' not why something happens i can not see any good reason why the `` why '' questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists if supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist my apologies i was using why as `` why did this come to be '' why did pre-existence become existence why did pre-spacetime become spacetime but we come to the admission that science fails to answer `` why '' because it ca n't be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid i do n't believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite having all of the parts available just my opinion this opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems do christians in general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life say small bacteria in a lab i suppose we would do the same thing as when galileo or capernicus was vindicated before someone starts jumping up and down screaming '' inquisition `` note i said vindicated i certainly hope we 've gotten beyond the `` shooting the messenger '' stage m. pihko does present a good point though we may need to ask `` what do i as an individual christian base my faith on '' will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our `` sacred cows '' or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what god said and continues to say in his word `` why do i ask why '' apologies to budweiser and company 8^ jason -- jason d. smith jasons atlastele.com i 'm not young enough to know

93104.173826u28037 uicvm.uic.edu jason kratz u28037 uicvm.uic.edu writes deleted and as far as fully-automatic weapons you can be a lot better armed if you want to hit what you aim at what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of proportion in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city vs. gang members of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time of course they do n't and that 's the point i was trying to make every day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in the majority that i see are still carrying revolvers not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you 're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat i mean semi-auto handguns you 're going to be at a disadvantage even with training i have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were `` practicing '' shooting they were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they were n't doing too badly either the university cops here who are are state cops are armed better than the chicago police it seems most state cops are every city and suburban police officer i 've seen around the twin cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type different brands though i have n't seen any glock 's with regard to this discussion we are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g and close to the realm of r.g but i 'd like to put my two cents worth in while there 's nothing wrong with a revolver especially a large frame s w in .357 magnum my favorite there are valid advantages to semi-autos i suggest reading massad ayoob 's i know some people ca n't stand him and think he 's full of bull but i think that in general his material is very valid and useful book _the semi auto pistol in police work_ or something like that he defines a number of ways that semi-auto 's are different and that '' different is good '' the main advantage is not in increased firepower but in more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode there is also a certain `` propriatory nature '' of each gun that takes some familiarity to learn this may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun define `` armed better '' go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the colt .45 does one fires faster than the other nope aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable sure it makes the other guys duck for cover but just you trying hitting anything with a thompson in hose-mode this is why the military is limiting it 's m-16 now to 3-round burst-fire simple semi-auto would be better but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful a revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again a double-action revolver almost all of them can be hand-cocked first but will fire merely by pulling the trigger yes but this is best done with a two hand hold with a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action the da semi auto has the same advantages plus is always sa after the first shot a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round i 'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point in a da semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round an advantage you do n't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round discussing this point now this is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation granted it 's very rare but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time a revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion even one handed actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended a revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi-autos can be faster depending on users the best speedloader users especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast a problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed this means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always take more time you also do n't have the advantage of tactical reloads replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity the partial magazine can still be used if needed later a misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so is often lost as you realize `` hey it 's jammed '' before starting to do anything about clearing it yes the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it really though in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small you are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns sigs glocks et.al. most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some police carry their semi-autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged i do not consider this safe however you must trade-off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver there are some double-action semi-autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training all common semi-auto 's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems while i put that out as a statement that i believe i should say that this applies to all of the ones i 've looked at for the da semi 's it's no different from the revolver situation the guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks they also have a safety because there 's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver plus the advantage of sa followup shots i'm not familiar with sa semi-autos except for the 1911-a1 i admit that i was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked but after examining the design trying to defeat the safeties gun unloaded of course and shooting it a lot i see no inherent safety problems with it especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer this design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver some police departments switched to glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers too many were having accidents partly due to the poor training they received not that glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a vcr yeah the infamous glock i still ca n't figure out how it 's worse than a revolver for safety if you do n't pull the trigger it does n't go off i imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it in addition if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you 'd have problems when the hammer was n't there anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police do n't know nothing about firearms turn off cops and hunter and pay attention i do not seek here to say `` semi-autos are junk '' merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid a cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot i think this is even okay for a riot as long as it 's a small one b^ gun control is hitting what you aim at if you whip out a wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you do n't hit anything good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit i own a 9mm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver if i have n't hit what i 'm aiming at in the first shots something is quite seriously wrong somewheres while i might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than i have the poor man 's beretta taurus and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the springfield .45 oops 9mm vs. arguments are relegated to r.g you are right though if you do n't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed i do n't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun this is a shooter failure whether through lack of discipline or lack of training what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use well actually some police prefer the much heftier .357 magnum but anyway ..... 9mm 's are becoming more popular with crooks too though the .38 does still lead the list and like i said around here semi-auto 's seem the rule for the street cop do n't know about the state patrol however they may still carry the `` highway patrolman '' obplea do n't flame me i prefer semi-autos for most things but they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal vincent please do n't take any of this as a flame just my 0.02 whoops looks more like 2.00 worth and much of it is imho but do check ayoob 's book -- `` if everything had gone as planned everything would have

national desk contact white house office of the press secretary 202-456-2100 washington april -- following are remarks by president clinton in a question and answer session with the press 1:36 p.m. edt the president on february the 28th four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective a 51-day standoff ensued the federal bureau of investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life the bureau 's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing david koresh was dangerous irrational and probably insane he engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency he was moreover responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in february given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi designed to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it was hoped force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender i was informed of the plan to end the siege i discussed it with attorney general reno i asked the questions i thought it was appropriate for me to ask i then told her to do what she thought was right and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday 's action ended in a horrible human tragedy mr. koresh 's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive he killed those he controlled and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued now we must review the past with an eye towards the future i have directed the united stated departments of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why and whether anything could have been dne differently i have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation i expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review finally i have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances again i want to say as i did yesterday i am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in waco i hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks and i hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now q mr. president can you first of all tell us why after days you decided -- q mr. president can you describe for us what it is that janet reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- the president i ca n't hear you both if one will go first and then the other q sorry can you describe what janet reno -- q mr. president -- the president i 'll answer both your questions but i ca n't do it at once q can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it the president yes i was told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound and she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building and it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside i was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon they were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire in fact as you know an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials there were no shots coming back from the government side i asked a number of questions the first question i asked is why now we have waited seven weeks why now the reasons i was given were the following number one that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there they might be needed in other parts of the country number two that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult members to come out number three that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time and number four that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions so for those reasons they wanted to move at that time the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good she said that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time the third question i asked was has the military been consulted as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco that 's the first thing i asked to be done because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation military people were then brought in helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it and so i asked if the military had been consulted the attorney general said that they had and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance having asked those questions and gotten those answers i said that if she thought it was the right thing to do that she should proceed and that i would support it and i stand by that today q mr. president -- the president wait go ahead q can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely television radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster the president no i 'm bewildered by it the only reason i made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold there was -- i have -- i ca n't account for why people speculated one way or the other but i talked to the attorney general on the day before the action took place i talked to her yesterday i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry king show and i talked to her again this morning a president -- it is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control i will say this however i was frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves applause i regret what happened but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance these people killed four federal officials in the line of duty they were heavily armed they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly and they were never fired back on we did everything we could to avoid the loss of life they made the decision to immolate themselves and i regret it terribly and i feel awful about the children but in the end the last comment i had from janet reno is when -- and i talked to her on sunday -- i said now i want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she said it 's because of the children they have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they 're in increasingly unsafe conditions and that they do n't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time i have to take their word for that so that is where i think things stand q can we assume then that you do n't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome that you did n't run out of patience and if you had it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no -- well i think what you can assume is just exactly what i announced today this is a -- the fbi has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety-split record time we want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way is there something else we should have known is there some other question they should have asked is there some other question i should have asked can i say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different i do n't know that that 's why i want the inquiry and that 's why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non-political outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have there is unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world and we may have to confront it again and i want to know whether there is anything we can do particularly when there are children involved but i do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves q mr. president were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from february 28th until yesterday the president well yes i got regular reports all along the way there were lots of other options pursued if you go back -- you all covered it very well the fbi -- you did a very good job of it i mean the fbi and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way and a lot of them early on seemed to be working some of the children got out some of the other people left there was a -- at one point there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the authorities and then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday the conversation i had with the attorney general did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves that 's what they thought q did the government know that the children did not have gas masks q congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that the president that 's up to the congress they can do whatever they want but i think it 's very important that the treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts and as i said in my statement if any congressional committees want to look into it we will fully cooperate there is nothing to hide here this was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country more

18, document_id from zbib bnr.ca sam zbib subject legality of the jewish purchase was re israeli expansion-lust adam shostack writes sam zbib writes i 'm surprised that you do n't consider the acquisition of land by the jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state as a hostile action leading to war it was for the purpose of establishing a state not an exclusive state if the state was to be exclusive it would not have arab citizens could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of israel right after it was formed and no i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action when someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce it is not a hostile action leading to war no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity palestinians are no exception perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions basic anti-trust law says that while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of investing you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling ibm you can do so only if you make your intentions clear apriori clearly the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality being a multi-ethnic multi-religious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another religion plus they paid fair market value etc ... they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy i 'm not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one is hard to dismiss as to whether the jews wanted to live in peace maybe however they wanted and still want an exclusively jewish state where jews are in control and jews are the masters of the land living in peace is meaningless unless it means living with someone else as equal for a native arab this does not leave many options oh you mean like both jews and arabs being citizens the arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who they vote for as the jews again adam the devil is in the details i do n't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its ok to return deportes and leave the rest because is a nice number that you can devide by and besides it has an integer square root those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless and ineffective minority if i were wrong you 'd have israel recall all the palestinian refugees we 're talking millions after all they are civilians huh the people who left did so voluntarily there is no reason for israel to let them in do you actually believe this my experience tells me that every palestinian i knew still keeps the key to his home in palestine besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell so to speak i know none that agrees with you did you sample their opinions i know you do n't care just being rethorical israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing israel got no western aid in nor in or ... it still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained and how is granting citizenship a facade do n't get me wrong i beleive that israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group jews israel probably had a few options after ethnic cleansing serbian style and deserve the wrath of the international community or make the best out of a no win condition show the world how good israel is towards the 'bad arabs personaly i 've never heard anything about the arab community in isreal except that they 're there so yes they 're there but as a community with history and roots its dead tell me something sam what makes land `` arab '' how shall i explain its a contract between the man and the land control is n't it the ottomans ruled years and then left with barely a trace the concept of land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic west it is partly the concept of 'le sol natal native soil i know that jews had previous history in the region but none in recent memory i 'm talking everyday life not archeology try again you tell me what its is n't but you fail to establish what it is also jews did have history in israel for over a thousand years there were lots of jews slaughtered by crusaders in israel there was a thriving community in gaza city from roughly 1200-1500 jews were a majority in jerusalem from or so onwards does that make the land jewish i stand corrected i meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in palestine in recent history i have no problem with jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly jewish so there what to make of the rest palestine adam shostack adam das.harvard.edu -- sam zbib bell-northern research -- -- -- --

thinking about the price the sumgait armenians paid to be living in armenia now we paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates -- the price was too great now after the sumgait tragedy we the victims divide our lives into `` before '' and `` after '' we talk like that that was before the war like the people who went through world war ii and considered it a whole epoch a fate no matter how many years go by no matter how long we live it will never be forgotten on the contrary some of the moments become even sharper in our rage in our sorrow we saw everything differently but now they say that you can see more with distance and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every sumgait armenian those who lost someone and those who did n't that second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family although you could already smell danger in the air but we did n't think that the danger was near and possible so we did n't take any steps to save ourselves at least as my parents say at least we should have done something to save the children my parents themselves are not that old and years but then they thought that they had already lived enough and did everything they could to save us in our apartment the tragedy started on february around five in the afternoon i call it a tragedy and i repeat it was a tragedy even though all our family survived when i recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls even now among armenians among people who wish me only well i feel like it 's all starting over again i remember how that mob broke into our apartment my parents were standing in the hall my father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by we 're known as a hospitable family and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were azerbaijanis jews or russians we had friends of many nationalities even a turkmen woman my parents were in the hall my father with an axe i remember him telling my mother `` run to the kitchen for a knife '' but mother was detached pale as though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer to be honest i never expected it of her she 's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark a girlfriend was at the house that day a russian girl lyuda and mamma said '' no matter what happens no matter what they do to us you 're not to come out of the bedroom we 're going to tell them that we 're alone in the apartment '' we went into the bedroom there were four of us marina and the russian girl crawled under the bed and we covered them up with a rug boxes of dishes and karina and i are standing there and looking at one another the idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside me i 'm an emotional person and i express my emotions immediately i wanted to embrace her and kiss her as though it were the last second and maybe karina was thinking the same thing but she 's quite reserved we did n't have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard mamma raise a shout there was so much noise from the tramping of feet from the shouting and from excited voices i could n't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack but when mamma shouted the second time karina ran out of the bedroom i ran after her i had wanted to hold her back but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us immediately the only thing i managed to do was close the door behind me at least so as to save marina and her friend the mob was shouting all of their eyes were shining all red like from insomnia at first about people burst in but later i was standing with my back to the door and could n't see they came into the hall into the kitchen and dragged my father into the other room he did n't utter a word he just raised the axe to hit them but mamma snatched the axe from behind and said `` tell them not to touch the children tell them they can do as they want with us but not to harm the children '' she said this to father in armenian there were azerbaijanis from armenia among the mob who broke in they understood armenian perfectly the local azerbaijanis do n't know armenian they do n't need to speak it and one of them responded in armenian `` you and your children both we 're going to do the same thing to you and your children that you armenians did in kafan they killed our women our girls our mothers they cut their breasts off and burned our houses '' and so on and so forth `` and we came to do the same thing to you '' this whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us they were mostly young people under at first there were n't any older people among them and all of their faces were unfamiliar sumgait is a small town all the same and we know a lot of people by their faces especially me i 'm a teacher so they dragged my father into the other room they twisted his arms and took him in there no they did n't take him in there they dragged him in there because he was already unable to walk they closed the door to that room all but a crack we could n't see what was happening to father what they were doing to him then a young man about years old started to tear off mamma 's sarafan and mamma shouted at him in azerbaijani `` i 'm old enough to be your mother what are you doing '' he struck her now he 's being held mamma identified him i hope he 's convicted then they went after karina who 's been talking to them like a komsomol leader as though she were trying to lead them down a different path as they say to influence their consciousness she told them that what they were doing was wrong that they must n't do it she said `` come on let 's straighten this out without emotions what do you want who are you why did you come here what did we ever do to you '' someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home but then the ones in the back -- more of them kept coming and coming -- said `` what are you talking to them for you should kill them we came here to kill them '' they pushed karina struck her and she fell down they beat her but she did n't cry out even when they tore her clothes off she kept repeating `` what did we do to you what did we do to you '' and even later when she came to she said `` mamma what did we do to them why did they do that to us '' that group was prepared i know this because i noticed that some of them only broke up furniture and others only dealt with us i remember that when they were beating me when they were tearing my clothes off i felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to karina all i could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her and what they did to her that 's why i felt no pain later when they carried karina off they beat her savagely it 's really amazing that she not only lived but did n't lose her mind she is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her beauty mostly they beat her face with their fists kicking her using anything they could find mamma karina and i were all in one room and again i did n't feel any pain just did n't feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they did then one of those creeps said that there was n't enough room in the apartment they broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more room then someone suggested `` let 's take her outside '' those beasts were in heaven they did what they would do every day if they were n't afraid of the authorities those were their true colors at the time i thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they were n't afraid of what would happen to them when they carried karina out and beat mamma-her face was completely covered with blood -- that 's when i started to feel the pain i blacked out several times from the pain but each moment that i had my eyes open it was as though i were recording it all on film i think i 'm a kind person by nature but i 'm vengeful especially if someone is mean to me and i do n't deserve it i hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain and every time i would come to and see one of those animals on top of me i 'd remember them and i 'll remember them for the rest of my life even though people tell me '' forget '' you have to forget you have to go on living at some point i remember that they stood me up and told me something and despite the fact that i hurt all over -- i had been beaten terribly -- i found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures i realized that i had to do something resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an end i pushed one of them away he was a real horse i remember now that he 's being held too as though they were all waiting for it they seized me and took me out onto the balcony i had long hair and it was stuck all over me one of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open and i realized that they planned to throw me out the window because they had already picked me up with their hands i was up in the air as though for the last time i took a really deep breath and closed my eyes and somehow braced myself inside i suddenly became cold as though my heart had sunk into my feet and suddenly i felt myself flying i could n't figure out if i was really flying or if i just imagined it when i came to i thought now i 'm going to smash on the ground and when it did n't happen i opened my eyes and realized that i was still lying on the floor and since i did n't scream did n't beg them at all they became all the more wild like wolves they started to trample me with their feet shoes with heels on them and iron horseshoes like they had spe- cially put them on then i lost consciousness i came to a couple of times and waited for death summoned it beseeched it some people ask for good health life happiness but at that moment i did n't need any of those things i was sure that none of us would survive and i had even forgotten about marina and if none of us was alive it was n't worth living there was a moment when the pain was especially great i withstood inhuman pain and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because i had showed myself to be so tenacious i started to strangle myself and when i started to wheeze they realized that with my death i was going to put an end to their pleasures and they pulled my hands from my throat the person who injured and insulted me most painfully i remember him very well because he was the oldest in the group he looked around i know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person one who would never do such a thing something came over him then you see even during the investigation he almost called me `` daughter '' he apologized although of course he knew that i 'd never forgive him something like that i can never forgive i have never injured anyone with my behavior with my words or with my deeds i have always put myself in the other person 's shoes but then in a matter of hours they trampled me entirely i shall never forget it i wanted to do myself in then because i had nothing to lose because no one could protect me my father who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself could do nothing and would n't be able to do anything i knew that i was even sure that he was no longer alive and ira melkumian my acquaintance i knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times -- her brother tried to save her and could n't so he tried to kill her his very own sister he threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffering when they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room her brother knew what awaited her i do n't know which one it was edik or igor both of them were in the room from which the axe was thrown but the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in sumgait i heard about it all from the neighbor from the melkumians landing his name is makhaddin he knows my family a little he came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in baku how we were feeling and if we needed anything he 's a good person he said '' you should praise god that you all survived but what i saw with my own eyes i a man who has seen so many people die who has lived a whole life i '' he says `` nearly lost my mind that day i had never seen the likes of it and think i never shall again '' the door to his apartment was open and he saw everything one of the brothers threw the axe because they had already taken the father and mother out of the apartment igor edik and ira remained he saw ira naked being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people he told us about it and said he would never forget it he heard the brothers shouting something inarticulate from pain rage and the fact that they were powerless to do anything but all the same they tried to do something the guy who got hit with the axe lived i i after i had been unsuccessful at killing myself i saw them taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom i was in such a state that i could n't even remember my sister 's name i wanted to cry `` marina '' out to her but could not i looked at her and knew that it was a familiar dear face but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was and thus i saved her because when they were taking her out she as it turns out had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and lyuda were both there by chance that they were n't armenians lyuda 's a russian you can tell right away and marina speaks azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an azerbaijani and i almost gave her away and doomed her i 'm glad that at least marina came out of this all in good physical health although her spirit was murdered at some point i came to and saw igor igor agayev my acquaintance in that mob he lives in the neighboring building for some reason i remembered his name maybe i sensed my defense in him i called out to him in russian `` igor help '' but he turned away and went into the bedroom just then they were taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom igor said he knew marina and lyuda that marina in fact was azerbaijani and he took both of them to the neighbors and the idea stole through me that maybe igor had led them to our apartment something like that but if he was my friend he was supposed to save me then they were striking me very hard -- we have an indian vase a metal one they were hitting me on the back with it and i blacked out -- they took me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window they were already sure that i was dead because i did n't react at all to the new blows someone said `` she 's already dead let 's throw her out '' when they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time when i was about to die the second time i heard someone say in azerbaijani `` do n't kill her i know her she 's a teacher '' i can still hear that voice ringing in my ears but i ca n't remember whose voice it was it was n't igor because he speaks azerbaijani with an accent his mother is russian and they speak russian at home he speaks azerbaijani worse than our marina does i remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me that person and i having opened my eyes saw and recognized that person but immediately passed out cold i had been beaten so much that i did n't have the strength to remember him i only remember that this person was older and he had a high position unfortunately i ca n't remember anything more what should i say about igor he did n't treat me badly i had heard a lot about him that he was n't that good a person that he sometimes drank too much once he boasted to me that he had served in afghanistan he knew that women usually like bravery in a man especially if a man was in afghanistan if he was wounded then it 's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically with respect later i found out that he had served in ufa and was injured but that 's not in afghanistan of course i found that all out later among the people who were in our apartment my karina also saw the secretary of the party organization i do n't know his last name his first name is najaf he is an armenian-born azerbaijani but later karina was n't so sure she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw and she did n't want to endanger him she said `` he was there '' and a little while later `` maybe they beat me so much that i am confusing him with someone else no it seems like it was he '' i am sure it was he because when he came to see us the first time he said one thing and the next time he said something entirely different the investigators have n't summoned him yet he came to see us in the khimik boarding house where we were living at the time he brought groceries and flowers this was right before march 8th he almost started crying he was so upset to see our condition i do n't know if he was putting us on or not but later after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the procuracy he said that he had been in baku he was n't in sumgait the fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that karina is right that in fact it was he who was in our apartment i do n't know how the investigators are now treating him at one point i wondered and asked and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment could n't he have gone to baku and arranged an alibi i 'm not ruling out that possibility ill now return to our apartment mamma had come to you could say that she bought them off with the gold father gave her when they were married her wedding band and her watch were gold she bought her own and her husband 's lives with them she gave the gold to a 14-year old boy vadim vorobyev a russian boy he speaks azerbaijani perfectly he 's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in sumgait on nizami street he goes to a special school one for mentally handicapped children but i 'll say this -- i 'm a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes i can form an opinion -- that boy is not at all mentally handicapped he 's healthy he can think just fine and analyze too policemen should be so lucky and he 's cunning too after that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album he beat mamma and demanded gold saying `` lady if you give us all the gold and money in your apartment we 'll let you live '' and mamma told them where the gold was he brought in the bag and opened it shook out the contents and everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it started knocking each other over and taking the gold from one another i 'm surprised they did n't kill one another right then mamma was still in control of herself she had been beaten up her face was black and blue from the blows and her eyes were filled with blood and she ran into the other room father was lying there tied up with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face there was a broken table on top of the pil- low mamma grabbed father and he could n't walk like me he was half dead halfway into the other world he could n't comprehend anything could n't see and was covered with black and blue mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth it was some sort of cloth i think it was a slipcover from an armchair the bandits were still in our apartment even in the room mamma pulled father out of led him out of carried him out of we had two armchairs in that room a small magazine table a couch a television and a screen three people were standing next to that screen and into their shirts their pants everywhere imaginable they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service -- mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye she said `` i was afraid to turn around i just seized father and started pulling him but at the threshold i could n't hold him up he fell down and i picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors '' mamma remembered one of the criminals the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her out of one eye she says `` i realized that my death would come from that person i looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing '' later they caught that scoundrel meanwhile mamma grabbed father and left i was alone igor had taken marina away mamma and father were gone karina was already outside i did n't know what they were doing to her i was left all alone and at that moment i became someone else do you understand even though i knew that neither mother and father in the other room nor marina and lyuda under the bed could save me all the same i somehow managed to hold out i went on fighting them i bit someone i remember and i scratched another but when i was left alone i realized what kind of people they were the ones i had observed the ones who beat karina what kind of people they were the ones who beat me that it was all unnecessary that i was about to die and that all of that would die with me at some point i took heart when i saw the young man from the next building i did n't know his name but we would greet one another when we met we knew that we were from the same microdistrict when i saw him i said `` neighbor is that you '' in so doing i placed myself in great danger he realized that if i lived i would remember him that 's when he grabbed the axe the axe that had been taken from my father i automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to take the blow of the axe although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery when he started getting ready to wind back for the blow someone came into the room the newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor 's axe froze in the air everyone stood at attention for this guy like soldiers in the presence of a general everyone waited for his word continue the atrocities or not he said `` enough let 's go to the third entryway '' in the third entryway they killed uncle shurik aleksandr gambarian this confirms once again that they had prepared in advance almost all of them left with him as they went picking up pillows blankets whatever they needed whatever they found all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot someone else had already taken the other four people remained in the room soldiers who did n't obey their general they had to have come recently because other faces had flashed in front of me over those to hours but i had never seen those three one of them kuliyev i identified him later a native of the sisian district of armenia an azerbaijani had moved to azerbaijan a year before he told me in armenian '' sister do n't be afraid i 'll drive those three azerbaijanis out of here '' that 's just what he said `` those azerbaijanis '' as though he himself were not azerbaijani but some other nationality he said with such hatred `` i 'll drive them out of here now and you put your clothes on and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut because they 'll be coming back from apartment '' that 's when i found out that they had gone to apartment before that the person in the eskimo dogskin coat the one who came in and whom they listened to the `` general '' said that they were going to the third entryway kuliyev helped me get some clothes on because l could n't do it by myself marina 's old fur coat was lying on the floor he threw it over my shoulders i was racked with shivers and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer he wanted to give them to me so that when he left i could nail the door shut but the door was lying on the floor in the hall i went out onto the balcony there were broken windows and flowers and dirt from flowerpots were scattered on the floor it was impossible to find anything he told me `` well fine i wo n't leave you here would any of the neighbors let you in they 'll be back they wo n't calm down they know you 're alive '' he told me all this in armenian then he returned to the others and said `` what are you waiting for leave '' they said `` ah you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her yourself no we want to do it to '' he urged them on but gently not coarsely because he was alone against them although they were still just boys not old enough to be drafted he led them out of the room and went down to the third floor with them himself and said `` leave what 's the mat- ter are n't you men go fight with the men what do you want of her '' and he came back upstairs they wanted to come up after him and he realized that he could n't hold them off forever then he asked me where he could hide me i told him at the neighbors on the fourth floor apartment we were on really good terms with them we knocked on the door and he explained in azerbaijani the neighbor woman opened the door and immediately said `` i 'm an azerbaijani '' he said `` i know let her sit at your place a while do n't open the door to anyone no one knows about this i wo n't tell anyone let her stay at your place '' she says `` fine have her come in '' i went in she cried a bit and gave me some stockings i had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders i burst into tears even though i was wearing marina 's old fur coat it 's a short one a half-length i was cold all the same i asked `` do you know where my family is what happened to them '' she says `` no i do n't know anything i 'm afraid to go out of the apartment now they 're so wild that they do n't look to see who 's azerbaijani and who 's armenian '' kuliyev left ten minutes later my neighbor says `` you know lyuda i do n't want to lose my life because of you or my son and his wife go stay with someone else '' during the butchery in our apartment one of the scum a sadist took my earring in his mouth -- i had pearl earrings on -- and ripped it out tearing the earlobe the other earring was still there when i 'm nervous i fix my hair constantly and then when i touched my ear i noticed that i had one earring on i took it out and gave it to her she took the earring but she led me out of the apartment i went out and did n't know where to go i heard someone going upstairs i do n't know who it was but assumed it was them with tremendous difficulty i end up to our apartment i wanted to die in my own home i go into the apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place to the fifth floor i had to do something i went into the bedroom where marina and lyuda had hidden and saw that the bed was overturned instead of hiding i squatted near some broken christmas ornaments found an unbroken one and started sobbing then they came in someone said that there were still some things to take i think that someone pushed me under the bed i lay on the floor and there were broken ornaments on it under my head and legs i got all cut up but i lay there without moving my heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town could hear it there were no lights on maybe that 's what saved me they were burning matches and toward the end they brought in a candle they started picking out the clothes that could still be worn they took father 's sport jacket and a bedspread the end of which was under my head they pulled on the one end and it felt like they were pulling my hair out i almost cried out and again i realized i was n't getting out of there alive and i started to strangle myself again i took my throat in one hand and pressed the other on my mouth so as not to wheeze so that i would die and they would only find me afterward they were throwing the burned matches under the bed and i got burned but i withstood it something inside of me held on someone 's hand was protecting me to the end i knew that i was going to die but i did n't know how i knew that if i survived i would walk out of that apartment but if i found out that one of my family had died i would die for sure because i had never been so close to death and could n't imagine how you could go on living without your mother or father or without your sister marina i thought was still alive she went to lyuda 's place or someone is hiding her i tried to think that igor would n't let them be killed he served in afghanistan he should protect her while i was strangling myself i said my good-byes to everyone and then i thought how could marina survive alone if they killed all of us how would she live all by herself there were six people in the room they talked among themselves and smoked one talked about his daughter saying that there was no children 's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter another said that he liked the apartment -- recently we had done a really good job fixing everything up -- and that he would live there after everything was all over they started to argue a third one says `` how come you get it i have four children and there are three rooms here that 's just what i need all these years i 've been living in god-awful places '' another one says '' neither of you gets it we 'll set fire to it and leave '' then someone said that azerbaijanis live right next door the fire could move over to their place and they to my good fortune did n't set fire to the apartment and left oh yes i just remembered while they were raping me they repeated quite frequently `` let the armenian women have babies for us muslim babies let them bear azerbaijanis for the struggle against the armenians '' then they said `` those muslims can carry on our holy cause heroes '' they repeated it very often reference for _the sumgait tragedy pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan volume i eyewitness accounts_ edited by samuel shahmuradian forward by yelena

'' 2- almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought by iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to undermine their non-military uses without any reference to iran's big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in near future and its current deficit in electrical power 3- the whole program is trying to show the sharif university of technology as a nuclear research center while even the cameramen of the program know well that in a country like iran without a so tightly closed society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university taking in account the scientific advancement of sharif u. in engineering fields and its potential role in improvement of iran 's industries and eventually the lives of people it is obvious that they are persuading other countries to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones in scientific and industrial efforts 4- a key point in program 's justifications is trying to disvalidate as much as possible all efforts done by iaea in their numerous visits from iran 's different sites they say `` we are not sure if the places visited by iaea are the real ones or not '' or `` we can not rely on iaea's reports and observation because they failed to see iraq 's nuclear activities before '' as if they did n't know that iraq was trying to build nuclear weapons 5- as an extremely personal opinion the most disgusting aspect of the program was the arrogance of the member of us senate foreign affairs william triplet in his way of talking as if he was the god talking from the absolute knowledge i hope all iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their country in western media and i hope iranian authorities continue to their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations mohammad international atomic energy agency"

evening we ran into one of my relatives at the bus station and got to talking a lot of people had gathered not far away near the store well at first we did n't know what was happening and then a fellow i know comes up to me an azerbaijani guy and says `` what are you standing here for go home immediately '' i asked `` what 's going on '' he says '' what 's the matter ca n't you see they 've overturned a car and they 're killing armenians '' he helped me catch a cab and we got home safely we sat at home for two days during that time a gang of bandits came into our courtyard but the neighbors would n't let them in the building there were about of them they had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands they were shouting something but you could n't understand it it was n't one voice or two all of them were shouting in a chorus they turned toward building they went up to the third _floor and we see that they 're breaking glass and throwing things out the window after a while they come out the entryway one has a pair of jeans in his hands another has a tape recorder and a third a guitar they went on toward the auto parts store we had to save ourselves after midnight on march we went to hide at school no which is in microdistrict there were two other armenian families there with us there were of us altogether out of all of them i had only known ernest before he had moved to sumgait from kirovabad the azerbaijani guard at the school let us in at first he did n't want to but there was nowhere else for us to go we had to plead with him and talk him into it we were told that on that day the 1st there would be an attack on our microdistrict we went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor on the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important i called one of them and the first secretary of the sumgait city party committee answered i asked him for assistance i say `` we 're in school no we need to be evacuated '' well he says `` got it wait there i 'm sending out help now '' i know his voice the first secretary had been to our plant i had spoken with him personally when i called he said `` muslimzade here '' about two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school we looked out the window and about to people were outside saying `` armenians come out we 're here to get you '' they have clubs axes and armature shafts in their hands the guard sat there with us and asked `` where should i go '' i say `` if your life is of any value to you you 'll go down there and say that the armenians were here and that they left '' that 's what he did he went down there and said `` the armenians were here '' he said `` i let them out the back door they went that way '' and pointed with his hand and with shouts and noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed so the assistance we had been promised did come they sent us help all right instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own i am positive that muslimzade did that no one had seen us entering the school no one knew that we were there in any case we stayed at the school until seven in the morning and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid in the morning we went to my relative 's in microdistrict and the soldiers took us to the sk club from there the club was jammed with people and there were lots of people ahead of us -- there was no space available one small boy about three months old died right in my arms there was n't a single doctor nothing the boy was uninjured there were no wounds or bruises on him he was just very ill they gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation they did everything they could under the circumstances but were unable to save him and his mother and father a young armenian couple were right there on the floor ... i searched for a spot for us in the sk we have a small child of our own i wanted to find a room or something to put my family in i went up to the third floor there were a lot of soldiers up there bandaged with canes limping with their heads broken open they were a terrible sight young guys all of them there were a lot of bandaged armenians too everyone had been beaten everyone was crying wailing and calling for help i think that the city party committee ignored us completely true there was a snack bar a sausage was kopeks or kopeks a package of cookies that cost kopeks was being sold for a bottled soft drink cost a ruble but there was no way to get the things any cheaper i met my old uncle aram mikhailovich there he saw

18, document_id from shaig think.com shai guday subject re rejoinder questions to israelis in article igc.apc.org center for policy research cpr igc.apc.org writes from center for policy research cpr subject rejoinder questions to israelis to shaig think.com subject ten questions to israelis dear shai in the answer to my first question concerning the nonexistence of israeli nationality your answer conflicts with information i have received from other quarters according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying israelis citizenship ezrahut and nationality le'um the former is used on passports etc and the later for daily identification in israeli society i am told that people in israel have to carry their id cards at all times and present them at many public places almost every day these id cards make clear who the holder is a jew or an arab you maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided but do you really believe that this is the reason could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose a number of points you are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used true by law all residents citizens and tourists must carry a form of identification with them for citizens the standard id is the id card the purpose this serves on a daily basis wherein they are presented at public places is for the purpose of identifying the bearer this takes place in banks cashing checks post offices registered mail and such etc ... quite frankly it was rare that i ever had to present my id card for such activities more than once per week there is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their id cards in public furthermore none of the services i outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information the only case that i can think of in which the le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police based upon the scenario in general though arab citizens are clearly recognizable as are non-arabs your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially in the answer to my second questions concerning the fact that israel has no fixed borders you state that israel 's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace according to what i read the first zionists in the beginning of the century had plans for the jewish state to extend into what is lebanon and into transjordan jordan i also read that it was the express wish of ben-gurion to not declare israel 's borders when israel was established as this might restrict israel 's opportunities for later expansion israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that jews lived there years ago or that god promised the land to them but according to biblical sources the area god promised would extend all the way to iraq and what were the borders in biblical times which israel considers proper to use today finally if israel wants peace why ca n't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a base for negotiations having all the above facts in mind one can not blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism as a number of wars have proved i take issue with your assertions i think that arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from `` israeli expansionism '' militarily israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile armed and insurgent population for a sustained period of time as is the intifada is heavily taxing the israeli economy proof of this can be seen in the israeli withdrawal from lebanon israeli troops pulled back from the awali and later from the litani in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of katyusha missile fire public opinion in israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions the israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it with regards to borders let me state the following i may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position the arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders if israel were to state large borders the negotiations might never get under way if israel were to state smaller borders then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations i think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible your answer to my third question is typical of a stalinist public official i do n't think your answer is honest you refer me to vanunu 's revelations about israel 's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations now if he said the truth then why should he been punished and if he lied why should he be punished i would appreciate more honesty your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a `` center for policy research '' whether or not all of vanunu 's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were for disclosing `` state secrets '' after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public one should be punished as to which were and which were n't i am under no moral obligation to disclose that quite the reverse in fact he was taken to court tried and found guilty you may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of `` secrets of state '' something which every democratic govt has somebody provided an answer to the fourth question concerning 'hidden prisoners in israeli prisons he posted an article from ma'ariv documenting such cases it seems that such prisoners do exist in israel what do you think about that i noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist the clu noted which you evidently did not pay attention to that they know of no such reports or cases i am sorry to tell you but in a country of mill as tightly knit as israel even if the matter of the arrest was not made public within a relatively short time frame most people would know about it my own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of x hours this would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation you imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon israel such terms have often been used by the soviet union against dissidents they call the soviet union into disrepute if my questions are not disturbing they would not call forth such hysterical answers my questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts i would be very happy if you could convince me that what i am told about israel were just fabrications but alas you have failed to do so i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion this is a sign of weakness not of strength well i am sorry to say that your questions are slanted such questions are often termed `` tabloid journalism '' and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity such questions were often used during the mccarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then to use your own example these questions might have been lifted from the format used by stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture my answers were not any more `` hysterical '' than the questions themselves the problem is not that the q 's were provocative it was that they were selective in their fact seeking you fall into the same category of those who seek `` yes '' `` no '' answers when the real answer is `` of sorts '' i suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal no you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit a sign of strength is the ability to look you remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect the color blindness you exhibit is a true sign of weakness i hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth ditto -- shai guday stealth bombers os software engineer thinking machines corp.

dscomsa.desy.de hallam dscomsa.desy.de phill hallam-baker writes in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered children and ordered the suicide/murder of his other followers according to the account given the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the koresh/gun supporter claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up if the aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns for all practical purposes they were unarmed the b-d followers had automatic weapons ... the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this is simply rationalisation it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through i must object to the characterization of those opposed to the government 's handling of the waco situation as `` gun supporters '' your argument tries to paint the batf critics as right-wing gun nuts and just mixes up two issues i am one of the batf/fbi critics and yet i am a liberal and just as anti-gun as you are i just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights even religious crazies they 're all human beings not some nest of wasps that you 're trying to exterminate the batf created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original raid it was well known that koresh regularly went jogging outside his property he could have been served with a search warrant then he could have been arrested if he had refused to comply instead officers armed with grenades invaded the property this escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both sides those were the first two mistakes the bad judgment of asking for a no-knock warrant and the bad and probably illegal way the already-unwise warrant was served at this point the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis that 's when the government started covering their traces sealing the warrant revising their reported history of the incident etc things were already building up to disaster now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and waited but according to janet reno that option had `` never been seriously considered '' so supposedly because the agents were `` frustrated and fatigued '' and because there supposedly were no backups they felt they had to go in yes the govt handled it in the rambo hollywood type style with extreeme machismo perhaps thats not the way to handle it it is a completely different thing to start asserting as many have done that the government is primarily to blame the comparisons with the nazis in particular are purely gratuitous since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your post desreves to be taken seriously peter nelson also made some very good points about how a low key approach might have been more effective the point is though that you learn through mistakes the govt played the wrong card and lost thats not a big deal they had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they just were not prepared for wuite this situation who could be if the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps be able to castigate the govt if they used the same tactics and failed in the same way as it is i ca n't say that i would not have made the same mistake maybee i would n't because i do n't as a rule go in for a confrontational situation if i can avoid it maybee i would because with all those press about its very difficult not to try the macho stuff the fbi had information from within the compound we had no access to they may have calculated that the b-d followers resolve was cracking based on their listening devices within the compound they knew that koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt this may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have been a weapon for breaking his resolve again in panama they had used the heavy rock music to great effect during bush 's invasion funny that few of the koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the death of several thousand pananmanian civilians while the us govt attempted to arrest their former ally and please let 's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun discussion anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government agents and koresh 's civil rights exist whether his guns were legal illegal illegal-but-should-have-been-legal or whatever koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired on

martha.utcc.utk.edu pa146008 utkvm1.utk.edu david veal writes in article c5jpl7.5cz dscomsa.desy.de hallam dscomsa.desy.de phill hallam-baker writes in article 1993apr12.002302.5262 martha.utcc.utk.edu pa146008 utkvm1.utk.edu david veal writes well yes and no the federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what maddison etc were up to from them there are a couple of ways to look at them one is `` we want you to support this constitution so we 'll say anything that we think will appeal to you '' or the more straightforward `` this is why we think what we 've suggested in this constitution is a good idea '' you clearly consider the former to be the primary situation the point is that they did not make pains to point out where the consitution may have been aginst the new yorker 's interests also they did not want to raise opposition by basing their advocacy on unpopular principles horrors appealing to popular principles can we perhaps as the question of whether the constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles rather than as you appear to believe it was written with something else in mind and `` propoganda '' put out by its supporters but let 's be honest about something here when was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments or are they simply propogranda we ca n't know what phill really means because he 's obviously using arguments designed to convince well i know hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist and probably the authoritarian extreme to jefferson 's democratic impules but what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we do n't consider what they wrote about the government i do n't propose that any means exists for determining their true opinions thus their true opinions died with them and are of little help today their opinions have not the slightest bearing on the matter though only their arguments these are true or false regardless of who said them or why if they 're true or false regardles of why they were said why on earth did you make a point of calling them `` propogranda '' that would seem to be irrelevent the difficulty that most us posters seem to have is in considering that their arguments may have been flawed or no longer apply to modern societies oh i have no argument with questioning them i do n't believe they no longer apply but that 's because i think most of them were good arguments i 'm not entirely happy about the situation because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time but i don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them if they were alive today the one opinion we could count upon these men to express is that a careful study of the mechanisms of government is necessary and that an ongoing improvement of the same is required they gave their opinions in certain areas and have been proved right in other areas they got it wrong they ensured that there was a mechanism to adapt and improve the consititution this can only happen if there is a willingness to accept that the structural problems within the us political system may require constitutional change as a solution since the u.s. constitution is the basis for the u.s. political system most changes in it would require constitutional change in this particular case however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition it only should have been made part of the constitution if the senate was less powerful than the house of lords than we 'd almost have to state that the house of representatives was also in fact they both were because the british government had much greater power than did the american system in principle no in practice yes in principle no that they had less power of that they should have had less power the british government today is theoreticaly dependent on the will of the monarch by convention any monarch seeking to exercise that power is deposed the subtly is that the prime minister is not able to identify their politics with the national interest in the same manner that us presidents regularly do phill we 're discusing the power of legislative houses while the prime minister is member of parliament he is more analgous although badly to the u.s. president now please explain to me how the u.s. house of representatives is `` in principle '' more powerful than the house of lords or the senate but in practice is less are you suggesting that the writers of the constitution really intended for them to be more powerful but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they 'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the senate in i disagree the system is not too slow it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle as somebody in washington put it whose name i forget `` congress has become everybody 's city council '' one reason for that is that at every level the government is rendered unable to come to decisions these decisions are pushed up to the next higher level instead not at all as any entry level political science course will tell you people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to `` attack '' which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want with national `` interest groups '' it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the federal government to enact a law rather than the states less people to persuade and less '' contributions '' to make why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the federal level simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension the same extends to insurance medicine and most other questions local government has not `` failed '' in that it has n't done what it should but that it is dominated by local interests thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules ca n't get their rules past the local government thus since they 've got more clout only in the wrong place they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower i mean let 's get real here do we really need the congres of the united states deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern or that carjacking needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime the more people want the more congress will take power to `` sell '' it to them for their votes i do n't think the rise of `` special interests '' is coincidence with the increased power of congress congress is more than capable of quick action and has more than enough power and time on its hands if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy if they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current '' no state subsidy motto '' they would be better placed as it is there is plenty of state money being handed out the problem is that it is distributed on the basis of power in congress and not on the basis of actual need bingo the higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters because political power can be concentrated at higher levels while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness in order to set up a school project in new york state you have to pay off the other states with pork defense contracts agricultural subsidies etc or to be precise of the states since you need to beat the filibuster then why not simply leave new york 's education to new york i remain unconcinved that there is any state in the union which is not capable of educating its own children if that 's what they want to do and if you leave it to them you only have to worry about the `` pork '' in that state and since industries ca n't concentrate their political power and wealth rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want individual voices have more relative impact the problem with the fillibuster is not that you must `` buy off '' states but that the congress has acquired too much power to sell pork it is not a case of the system of government they created failing but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid namely a concentration of power it would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either house in some attempt to grease the wheels all you 'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things it would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level no you have to break the machine free of seizure before you can redirect it but why on earth should we want to redirect it you said yourself that you have to sell pork to get things through congress if congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction the pork problem is significantly reduced the current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility to come to a decision the current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action thus it the system is weighted against action considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force i consider bias against making those decisions a good thing pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't work unless the lower levels are less corrupt in most cases they are worse not better the difference with the lower pyramid is that a they have more legal legitimate authority in most matters under our constitution than the federal government and b at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate and c you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once you get to see them tried out without a national decision congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole yet even with similar problems in different areas different solutions may be called for and while i often do n't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make at least i have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off i 'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in washington with half a million or more constituents i 'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt i fail to see where any restrictions implied or otherwise were placed on the veto it could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise in the executive's opinion policies since we were arguing from the federalist papers i would point to them phill you brought up the federalist papers we were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of senators should be allowed to hold up a bill you claimed the senate was suppose to be a far less powerful house and i contended there was nothing in the constitution or other writings which indicated this which was when you brought up that we ca n't decide what the founders wanted based on the federalist papers you argued against them i never argued from them i have primarily referred to the constitution which places only very small restrictions on the senate than for the house the us constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work the only part where a reason is given is the right to bear arms ammendment where the well regulated militia justification is ambiguous the u.s. constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document the delcaration of independence was the high-brow reasoning there are a couple of other examples though such as the reasoning for the power to tax and the reasoning for the power to grant permits both in article i section that the veto was meant to be an exceptional measure follows from the fact of the senate if the president was meant to revise legislation then there would be three chambers of the legislature not two furthermore the separation of powers would have been much less distinct to a certain extend i do believe the veto has become something it was n't intended however i also believe it is inevitable considering the congress own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say unlike most people i think we should n't be worrying about the veto which is fine but of the problem in congress which almost necessitates its abuse there is no limit in the constitution to the president 's veto power regarding what a bill is for previous presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons most usually having something to do with their agenda i am really curious how you single bush out as the president who abused vetos he has the record for vetos bush phill that 's absurd bush had vetos one of which was over-ridden go read up on fdr if you think that's anything resembling a record why is it not a reasonable restriction because senators is the magic holy number upon which laws must be based if senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster is n't that enough to indicate there 's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it up to a point the fact is though that when the majority are opposed by a minority the minority should not be allowed to win by default why not what is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action historically governemnt action in the u.s. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful when you 're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority why one earth should be sufficient to enact a law which covers million people in very very diverse places and living in radically different conditions why should n't a super-majority be required because the bill at issue is a money bill relating to a short term proposal now we 're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill i do n't see how it make a difference it is not a change in the law where a presupposition in favour of the status quo is arguable sure it 's arguable theyr e arguing it however requiring to bring it to a vote ensures that they 'll have to have a good argument something that is n't based solely on party lines any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority will be ignored i do not see this as a positive thing and for all that i 'm sure the republicans are looking for pork as much as the democrats they 've got some legitimate objections to the legislation in question so instead you consider a system under which the minority automatically win to be superior no i am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for action since u.s. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities i feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about and is hardly a tiny minority i do n't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but i see no problem with biasing the federal system against action -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

19," document_id from clinton-hq campaign92.org clinton/gore '92 subject clinton remarks to law enforcement leaders the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april remarks by the president to law enforcement organizations the rose garden 2:52 p.m. edt the president good afternoon ladies and gentlemen two months ago i presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the american people their jobs and their economic future the federal budget plan passed congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country then the short-term jobs plan i presented to congress which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the house of representatives two weeks ago it now has the support of a majority of the united states senate all of these members of congress know it 's time to get the economy moving again to get job growth going again to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity unfortunately a minority of the members of the united states senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs bill when congress returns i ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at stake the issue is not politics it 's people sixteen million of them are looking for full-time jobs and ca n't find them these men and women do n't care about who 's up or down in washington they care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day 's work and supporting their families and drawing a paycheck they 're asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward i am prepared to do that and i have been working with the senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs plan i 'm willing to compromise so long as we keep the focus on jobs keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs our opponents have been asking for a smaller package today i ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the american people but even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller i believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of americans and one in particular and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime so i will ask even in this reduced package for an additional million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national recession together with a matching effort by local governments this could put as many as 10,000 police officers back on the job and back on the beat in communities all across our nation at a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments america can make and i ask both houses of congress to make that investment in our people 's safety and in their piece of mind i believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs make no mistake about it i will fight for these priorities as hard as i ever have i will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs their future and for fundamental change i want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that i had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police officers they came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the package and i want them to be free to talk about that they came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful future i say what i say today not just because it 's good for law enforcement but because it 's good for the people who live in these communities i have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they 're hired to protect it reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time these are the kinds of things that we are trying to do i promised in my campaign that i 'd do everything i could to put another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four years this makes a good downpayment on that this keeps in mind the core of the jobs package and this will help us to move forward so i ask the people in the senate who have blocked the jobs bill let 's work together i can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe streets i do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting prosperity for our people i have done my part now to end the gridlock i ask you to do yours i want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the american people -- beginning with janet reno the distinguished attorney general q mr. president can you tell us -- do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a vat tax at this point in the congressional dialogue the president not at all i think it should have -- they would n't have any relationship one to the other first of all i made absolutely no decision on that you should know that there 's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this economy but i have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax q do you personally believe that the american public is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care i mean apart from what business and labor leaders have said -- the president i 'm not going to speculate on that i will say this the real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the cost i mean that is -- everyone knows that if you do what we 're proposing to do if you streamline the insurance system if you fix the system so that there 's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain services if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it is n't now every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care system the real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security i have no idea the polls say that but i do n't know all i know is the polls that i see in the press that many of you have commissioned they say overwhelmingly the american people want the security of an affordable health care system but i do n't think that has anything to do with this stimulus and it certainly should n't have people want a job first and foremost they want that more than anything else q now that you 've announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable i assume summer jobs is one the president i want the summer jobs i want the highway program and i want the police program i still intend -- let me say this i still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill which did not pass the congress last year this is a supplement to that not a substitute for it in any way but i think we need to do that i think we need the ryan white funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with aids and there are several other things that i think should be done we have to do the agriculture department meat inspectors the safety of the public depends on that there are a number of other things that i do n't -- i do n't think any of it should be cut but i have given senator mitchell and senator byrd -- i talked to them and senator dole called me yesterday to discuss this and i told him that i would call him back i called him back last night in new hampshire and we discussed this and i basically asked them to talk today and said that i would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord so i do n't want to be any more specific than i have been already and let 's see if they can talk it out q when you talked to senator dole and senator mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also that million that you want that as part of the package the president i did -- i told senator -- i left word for senator mitchell last night about it when i talked to senator dole -- i do n't remember for sure -- i do not believe i mentioned it but i did tell him that i was prepared to reduce the package and i wanted to break the gridlock and i told him that i was working on a reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that i thought the american people wanted us to address and this is certainly consistent with that thank you end3:12 p.m. edt"

19," document_id from clinton-hq campaign92.org clinton/gore '92 subject clinton president 's remarks at town hall meeting the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april remarks by the president secretary of education richard riley and secretary of labor robert reich in goals satellite town hall meeting chamber of commerce building washington d.c. 8:30 p.m. edt secretary riley good evening and welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of april you know today is april 13th in thomas jefferson was born years ago i think that 's appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been of course a person who has been one that we 've all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country the success of our democracy according to jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system his philosophy of government his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening tonight we 're so pleased to have with us president clinton he 's come over from the white house to join us in the chamber of commerce studios mr. president it 's good to have you we thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening also we have with us secretary of labor robert reich and bob it 's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also i have some questions for our two guests and i 'm sure many of you do too so please call us if there 's something that you 'd like to ask the number is 1/800/368-5781 or in washington d.c. the number is 202/463-3170 or i believe the president has a few words that he might want to share with us and mr. president i 'll ask you to do that at this time it 's great to have you the president thank you very much mr. secretary i 'm glad to be here with my friends dick riley and bob reich -- also members of my cabinet -- at the headquarters of the chamber of commerce to support the effort that the chamber is making along with its center for work force preparation to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place i want to compliment the chamber on all their efforts recognizing that without an educated work force we ca n't grow this economy or remain competitive and recognizing that we all have to work together -- business and government labor and educators -- to make things happen this satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together and if you 'll forgive me a little home state pride i want to say a special word of thanks to the wal-mart corporation headquartered in bentonville arkansas for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight i appreciate that a lot as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you i have tried as hard as i could to move toward constructive change for this country secretary riley talked about this being thomas jefferson 's 250th birthday if thomas jefferson believed in anything he believed in these three things first in education second in real personal liberty freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of association freedom of the press and third in the absolute imperative of changing as times change if you go to the jefferson memorial here in this beautiful city which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms you will see jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times for us here in america that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world we 're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better unless we do that none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government even to bring the budget into balance even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs will last in the long run we also have to have people who can carry their load and in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime it 's not just important what you know but what you can learn and if i might i 'd like to close just by emphasizing we 're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the labor department and the education department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition and we 're trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time dick i think i ought to stop there that 's a good place we can begin i think the discussion secretary riley thank you so much mr. president each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals and tonight we 'll focus on goal five and how communities such as yours can prepare students for this world of work this week the education department and the labor department are hosting a conference here in washington d.c. called summer challenge a program of work and learning to america 's youth the aim is to use some special funds from president clinton 's proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country mr. president let 's talk a minute -- you alluded to it somewhat -- about the summer youth challenge your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs and why in your words is that so important the president i think it 's important for two reasons first of all a lot of the young people we 're trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning and while we want them to have a good experience with a real job we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime and that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before secondly we want to help these young people progress not only in terms of work but in terms of learning we want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners and we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school or at work or in college as they go on secretary riley well i think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids -- that gap that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year is really even greater secretary reich of course you have training programs throughout the year and i wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training secretary reich well what we 've learned mr. secretary is that for many young people whether it 's for the summer or for the year actually on-the-job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning many young people for example have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning geometry but when they actually are there building something or working on something and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry they understand what it 's used for and a lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly terribly important it 's important during the summer but it 's important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer secretary riley thank you mr. president you 've called for a youth apprenticeship program school-to-work transition and i wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing the president well first of all let 's talk about why it 's important most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four-year college degree but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma if you look at the last years the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade the young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade because they were n't productive they were n't more valuable to their employers so we think america has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but do n't go on to college make a transition to work which includes two years of further training either in a community college a vocational setting or perhaps on the job and what i have done in this budget as you know is to give you and secretary reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community based on the needs of the economy in any given area it could revolutionize long-term the quality of the american work force and the earnings of american workers secretary reich i should add mr. president -- i think you know this from your experience in arkansas -- and many of the people watching this program -- that the business community and educators labor groups are already in many of our communities many of our states building a school-to-work transition program in fact there 's an awful lot of ferment a lot of excitement the people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that and more power to them secretary riley and i are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there secretary riley bob we 're going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep the co-op learning career academies and what features all those programs that deal with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of these school-to-work programs might have that are important secretary reich well one thing that we 've seen -- and you and i have been working at this for a long time and you much longer than i -- we 've seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential and i 'm so delighted that we 're doing this in the headquarters of the chamber of commerce the chamber of commerce of the united states is committed to doing these kinds of programs -- training education retraining -- and we 've aimed to work very closely with the chamber the business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators community colleges technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future communities have got to come together i mean this is one of the most important things you 've got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together you know too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here labor groups over here and everybody is talking but they 're not really working together in a common strategy and the third and final ingredient i would say dick would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence this is not a tracking program we 're talking about for kids who are not going to make it this is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for if they want to go on beyond that to four-year college that 's fine that ought to be permissible but we 're talking about the foundation of learning about jobs the foundation skills for on-the-job learning and again those are the critical components it 's already being done the president i think -- if i might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home -- the business community has a critical role to play not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here 's what ought to be taught but also in monitoring that excellence if you have the right sort of partnership there the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them so i think that 's very important and when we try to if you will fill in the blanks at the federal level trying to set some standards and provide some funds one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs because that 's really what 's going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile secretary riley that 's great we 've been talking of course about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall but let 's talk just a moment about long-term school reform it 's something especially close to me mr. president i wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on goals legislation that i think will be coming forth before too long the president well as you know back when you and i were both governors we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize i had a hand in writing the national education goals that the governors drafted along with representatives of president bush 's administration back in and what we 're going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners too meet those goals -- making sure that when -- by people show up for school ready to learn that we get a percent on-time high school graduation rate that children at the 4th 8th and 12th grades are confident in the subjects they 're supposed to know that they are second to none in math and science that are schools are safe disciplined and drug-free and of course the fifth goal -- i took them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of life-long learning in this country and each one of those goals there 's a national role a state role a school role school district role and a private sector role and what you 've attempted to do in this bill you 're going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is and then to give the rest of america a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we 're actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet it 's very exciting so far as i know nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job i 'm really excited about it secretary riley well i am too and i think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts all driven by high standards that 's the point bob let me ask you one question and then we 'll get to the telephone calls it 's about the same subject we have of course skills standards that are going to be part of goals and i wonder if you would comment on that secretary reich well you know we have percent of our young people who do n't graduate from college very often they do n't have very many alternatives they do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs everybody does n't have to go to college other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical preprofessional skills we can do it in this country if you do n't go to four-year college you 're not a loser and we want to develop those national skill standards we 're going to be working with the states with the education department with a lot of private industry in developing those standards and i think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around as well as our business community secretary riley well that 's great why do n't we go ahead and go to the telephone we have a call i see -- mayor bruce todd of austin texas q yes mr. president and mr. secretary reich and riley we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today we have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative let me simply say amen to some of the comments made already we agree with much of the tone that the clinton administration has taken and are very supportive we have been successful here in austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years we expect to have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime perhaps as much as 3,500 with the federal assistance much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments so we must be thinking alike but the question essentially involved what initiatives after labor day would be appropriate we know summertime is important year-round is even more important and what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis and perhaps more importantly how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative that 's something that we believe is very important to success in this effort secretary riley mr. president the president i think i 'll give everybody a chance to answer the question bruce but let me first thank you for calling and thank you for all the great work that you 're doing in austin i 've seen some of it and i 've always been very impressed first with regard to the summer program we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector too we hope that -- secretary reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer and we 're working on that secondly in the program that i have presented to the congress over the next five years what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that 's quite substantial for job training programs for school-to-work programs all of which give heavy heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year-round basis and i will say again to echo what secretary reich said a moment ago to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning an awful lot of young people actually have quite high iqs but actually learn so much better when they 're doing than when they 're reading or just listening so we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent and we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have budget cuts and more than actually in the budget -- and some revenue raisers and some new money for education and training that we 'll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question bob do you want to say anything secretary reich well you took most of the words out of my mouth mr. president as usual but let me just add one thing and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college in addition to the school-to-work program simply is the availability of jobs and we 've got to get this economy moving again obviously it 's terribly important to get this recovery program to get the economy back on track that 's sort of the prerequisite to everything else if we do n't get the economy back on track -- we have -- i think this is the 16th -- correct me if i 'm wrong mr. president -- i think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater this is a jobless recovery a lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in june and even if we did everything right they would have a very very hard time getting jobs secretary riley thank you both of course goals will be a permanent long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year it will involve if passed -- and we certainly hope it will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways and then the state with all the various school districts a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement and i think everybody will see a great energy out there once we get that moving the next call is dr. harry heinemann new york doctor q good evening mr. secretary it is a pleasure to be on with you this evening as you may know bridging the school and work has been central to la guardia 's educational program since its inception in the 1970s and that includes the college the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus and the linkages we have forged with the local schools we have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy and over the years we 've come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work and these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace with providing all students early exposure to careers as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills and lastly the critical role of the liberal arts particularly in the development of high performance competencies my question then is how can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience and what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration secretary riley well thank you very much i think -- and we 'll get a response from you all on that and very interesting work going on there we 're going to have three people our next guests on the program this evening that will be some specialists in that area that you 're speaking and i 'll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later you all care to comment -- any comments you might have the president i 'd just like to say if i might one thing i want to reemphasize this and i do n't think i 'm being as clear about it as i 'd like although i think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than i. i think this whole concept of applied academics is very important and i think that we have to basically abolish what i consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning i think we should keep the liberal arts going i think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program secretary reich it seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students they 're important for all students it 's not just a special group of students that needs them some of the experiments that i 've seen around the united states -- dick i 'm sure you 've seen them as well -- are mainstream experiments they 're mainstreaming all the students at 11th and 12th grades they 're giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program and again the kids can either go on to college if they want they can go on to technical community they can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and career directions but we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom within our schools secretary riley thank you very much i think that 's going to be the last call that we have time for mr. president i think you 've got to move on to another matter and i want to thank you and secretary reich for being here we appreciate your time and your ideas and it 's been a tremendous help to us end9:00 p.m. edt"

20, document_id from kilroy gboro.rowan.edu dr nancy 's sweetie subject re freemasonry and the southern baptist convention there were some recent developments in the dispute about masonry among southern baptists i posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia and i suppose that it might be useful here note that i do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of what follows i present it as information for a short summary a southern baptist named larry holly wrote a book claiming that freemasonry is a religion incompatible with christianity mr holly 's father rejects christianity and mr holly blames that on the masons the sbc 's home missions board includes an interfaith witness department which studies other religions and how to teach them about christ a few years ago they were ordered to produce a report on masonry they concluded that it was not a religion and therefore was outside their speciality however mr holly led a movement of people who oppose masonry and last year the convention again ordered the hmb to study masonry i got the feeling that they were saying `` you got the wrong answer last time try to do better and get the answer we want '' anyway there 's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions but the dust has settled and the report is in nobody is entirely happy with it but everybody seems willing to live with it both sides are saying things such as `` this was the best we were going to get in the current environment '' the report commends the masons for the charity work they do such as the hospitals and burn centers they operate as well as efforts to help the elderly and prevent drug abuse the report acknowledges that many well- known christians are and have been masons and notes that many teachings of masonry are `` supportive of christian faith and practice '' examples of the latter include belief in god emphases on honesty and integrity and that some masonic lodges incorporate explicit christian beliefs on the other hand they note that some aspects of masonry are incompatible with southern baptist principles these included the use of titles which some people consider sacrilegious the taking of certain oaths even though they are not meant seriously the `` undeniably pagan and/or occultic '' writings of some masonic leaders the implication in some masonic writings that salvation can be achieved by good works and the racial discrimination practiced by many masonic lodges i note with some chagrin that baptist churches as a whole are n't really in a place to speak on this last point the report concludes that masonry is not a religion and says that membership should not be endorsed or censured but left to the discretion of individuals this was in part because there is variation among different masonic lodges and while one may include elements strongly against christianity another may not many southern baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of the believer and the autonomy of the local church and this history probably influenced how the report came out the information above was gleaned from `` the religious herald '' a publication of the baptist general association of virginia and `` baptists today '' which does not have any direct links to a religious organisation autonomy is a big issue among some baptists 8- because i have neither the report itself nor whatever masonic documents are relevant to these issues none of the above comes with a guarantee your mileage may vary void where prohibited darren f provine kilroy gboro.rowan.edu milton `` we use only the finest baby frogs dew picked and flown from iraq cleansed in finest quality spring water lightly killed and then sealed in a succulent swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose '' praline `` that 's as may be it 's still a frog ''

the flesh nor of the will of man but ra of god '' john 1:12-13 ra ra has it occured to you robert that being `` born of '' someone or being ra of that person or person 's `` family '' may be a symbolic term in the new ra testament mormons believe that we are `` adopted '' into the house of ra israel through baptism and faith in christ although some have expressed ra belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one matthew 13:38 i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father john 8:38 ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do ye not understand my speech even because ye can not hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it john 8:41-44 and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord acts 13:10 wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience ephesians 2:2 in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother john 3:10 one becomes a child of god ... but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name john 1:12 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is john 3:1-2 ... when he is born again through faith in jesus christ which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god john 1:13 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will ephesians 1:5 of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures james 1:18 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god romans 8:14-16 beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god john 4:7 whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him john 5:1 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus galatians 3:26 ra we are told that `` and this is life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent '' ra john 17:3 life eternal is to know the only true god yet the ra doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly ra different jesus a jesus that can not be reconciled with the jesus of ra the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim ra one as being true denies the other from being true according to the ra bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination ra ra ra robert with all due respect who died and left you chief arbiter of ra correct biblical interpretation i do n't mean to be snotty about this ra but the fact is that the bible is so differently interpreted by different ra groups of biblical scholars what do you think of the jehovah's ra witnesses for example that to make reference to the `` jesus of the ra bible '' is simply ridiculous whose `` jesus of the bible '' do you mean this is really a red herring it does n't address any issue raised but rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read something into the bible does n't change what the bible teaches for example the fact that the jehovah 's witnesses deny the deity of christ does not alter what the bible teaches `` looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ '' titus 2:13 '' simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ '' peter 1:1 on the deity of christ we first look to the bible to see what it teaches to discount or not even address what the bible teaches because there are some groups that have differing views is self-defeating to see what the bible teaches you have to look at the bible ra `` our lord 's mortality was essential to his own salvation '' _the ra promised messiah_ p. `` he had to work out his own salvation by ra doing the will of the father in all things '' ibid. p.54 `` he had ra to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom '' _mormon ra doctrine_ p.71 ra ra welcome to the wonderful world of mormon paradoctrine robert the ra above books are by the late bruce r. mcconkie a former general authority ra of the lds church those books were not published by the church nor do ra they constitute `` offical doctrine '' they consist of his opinions now ra does that mean that what he says is not true not at all i 'll have to ra think about the idea of christ 's personal salvation before i come to any ra conclusions myself the conclusions i come to may seem `` heretical '' to ra you but i 'm prepared to accept that i find this rather curious when i mentioned that the mormon belief is that jesus needed to be saved i put forward some quotes from the late apostle bruce mcconkie the curious part is that no one addressed the issue of jesus needing to be saved rick comes the closest with his `` i have my own conclusions '' to addressing the point most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine i don't think that it matters if mcconkie 's views were canon that is not the issue were mcconkie 's writings indicative of mormon belief on this subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may certainly be ============================= robert weiss psyrobtw ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

20, document_id subject re who 's next mormons and jews from `` casper c. knies '' isscck byuvm.bitnet isaac kuo saackuo spam.berkeley.edu writes in article 93109.231733isscck byuvm.bitnet `` casper c. knies '' isscck byuvm .b gedaliah friedenberg friedenb maple.egr.msu.edu writes as a latter-day saint i found john 's statement not at all ludicrous ... please allow me to explain myself in the governor of missouri governor boggs issued his so-called `` mormon extermination order '' the only crime `` illegal activity '' the latter-day saints had committed was their religious affiliation their anti-slave stance missouri still allowed slave practices and their growing numbers/influence in missouri i guess the mormons `` got what they deserved '' because they refused to bow to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities this `` disobedience '' brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from their lands and settlements ... it is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by '' average '' people and that at the time almost all americans were pretty homogeonously christian it was largely the mainstream christian 's disgust at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred true but that is exactly the `` problem '' the mormon extermination order was issued not just by a christian it was allowed under the constitution of the united states which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this `` order '' from occurring in the first place ... as i indicated in an earlier posting your `` irrational hatred '' is clearly evidenced by individuals like robert weiss who could have been gov boggs lieutenant he would have fitted right in drewling et al and seems a modern-day occurrence based on results slander persecution misrepresentation lies denying mormons representation in their own user group etc etc in intent and purpose what really has changed the situation is not entirely different today many irrational feelings and beliefs are justified through religion i do n't think most of them are started because of religion but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages critical thought true as evidenced by numerous examples as i am sure you 're aware in any regard mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities and i do n't even discuss how uthan 's were suckered into allowing part of their lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds ... is far from being trusted or righteous have things really changed for the better i may be a born cynic but i have no reason whatsoever that such has been the case in the early 1980s i believe the late president kimball lds church leader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the mx- '' peace keeper '' missile maze from being built in utah yet another `` inspired '' decision from secular authorities fortunately his opposition was influential enough for the feds to back off do you mean that the `` secular authorities '' are some continuous group of people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the mormons do you honestly believe that the main reason for using utah for nuclear testing etc .. was to `` get them thar mormons '' and what about the majority of uthan 's who are n't mormons you seem to be searching for enemy ^^^^^^^^ correction the majority of utahn 's are mormon 60-70 i believe up to a in many cities and settlements throughout the western states conspiracies it is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly must have been done primarily for that purpose what i mean is that secular authorities are to be watched as we believe that satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth judgment and justice in addition we believe that the adversary has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous greed for money would be a good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression and evil combinations as an intelligent being do n't you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power as far as utah is concerned what i pointed out were some horrible examples of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities which have brought death disease i.e the `` downwinders '' and environmental contami- nation i am hardly `` paranoid '' i am just not `` expecting '' too much from a secular government that may not share our values and faith and which indeed as gov boggs et al may be out to harm and destroy us as a matter of fact prophecies in my church indicate that in future years global persecution against mormons will so increase in intensity and scope that paraphrasing `` all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to zion '' zion the `` pure in heart '' will be re-established in those days and it ai n't our current secular authorities who will rule over it ... ... david koresh did not pose a great threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and with john i too wonder who or what 's next ... i personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the life of even one person sure he did not pose a threat to the security of this nation but he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers that much is definite hmmm `` definite '' by whom -- until such has been established beyond reason- able doubt this alleged `` threat '' may have been less than the `` threat '' imposed upon him and his followers by the batf and fbi ... who killed who what constitutional right did the atf officers have to invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound what really caused the `` murder '' of the little children could it be that the atf/fbi presence has any bearing upon the events how would you interpret the mt masada events -- blame the jews what the heck did the romans do there anyway what business did the atf/fbi has in waco texas the branch davidians never posed any threat to society this is like asking who really caused the deaths of the israeli olympic team in in that case the police botched the job as well but to lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake i think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case certainly if david koresh chose any peaceful option the atf and fbi would have complied the responsibility is more his than the authorities come now at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise peaceful stand-off `` let 's get it over with and `` force '' david koresh to come out '' -- by gassing them were they naive or what they played right into the hands of an apocalyptic-thinking individual he had prepared his people for this eventuality for years and not one firetruck or plan was in place to deal with this scenario i feel that the authorities had `` some '' responsibility to protect their own citizens even if they were religious zealots and guilty of ... not paying a gun license has the batf become an extension of the local tax-collectors david koresh no doubt will be described as the `` evil '' guy by the executioners while the actions of all those `` valiant and brave '' officers characterizing the atf/fbi as executioners is inaccurate and unfair in order to be an executioner the least one must have done is have the intent to kill que -- intrusion into private property with semi 's loaded with life ammunition is n't that implicit `` intent or at least `` prepared '' to kill '' i ask you would the batf warrant stand up in a civil court of justice i do not mind if criminals such as dangerous drug

3," document_id from rjn teal.csn.org robert j. niland subject re procomm plus for windows problems .... kentiler matt.ksu.ksu.edu kent p. iler writes i have normal procomm plus for dos but i 've been considering buying the windows version .... it got really great reviews in computer shopper i have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the modem .... he has a 14,400 modem on a mhz machine i can't see it having trouble keeping up his pcplus for dos works great re what to do after the high speed modem arrives edition apr this article applies only to windows 3.0 and 3.1 and not to nt os/2 or dos apps not running under windows one of the unadvertised limitations of most current windows pcs is that their rs-232c serial com performance is seriously deficient almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem v.32bis v.32 pep or hst discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming fax at 9600+ after upgrading the modem overrun and retry errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or fax program if the transfer completes at all it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem there are three reasons for the problem the universal asynchronous receiver/transmitters uarts used in most pcs are primitive ns8250 devices with single-byte fifo buffers if the operating system/driver can not read and flush each character at high interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the fifo and the previous one is lost dos being a fairly single-minded environment during datacomm can usually keep up windows ca n't windows has more operating system overhead than plain dos and interrupts often take longer to service overruns are much more likely than under dos as soon as you report to your pc/modem vendor that you are losing data you may be advised that `` you need to upgrade to a '' more likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance about this issue you 'll get no useful advice at all most of the store-front and mail-order sources i spoke with in attempting to solve my own problem had never heard the term `` '' and many did n't even know what a uart was even your pc has ns16550a uarts and ps/2 's do or if you can upgrade your mother/com board or add a new com board you may still experience errors and overruns because the standard microsoft windows com drivers do n't take full advantage of the windows 3.1 is improved in this regard over 3.0 but i still recommend a driver upgrade applications like procomm+/win which is what i use can not get around this problem by themselves if you have a modem card you may not have a problem as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the uart and avoid overrunning it however i would n't want to bet that the card designers were that clever and will insist on a uart if i ever buy a modem card some modem cards do n't even have conventional uarts but if they are to work with standard windows drivers they need to simulate one use msd.exe below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to be the hardware situation the uarts on most pc com ports are based on national semiconductor ns8250 or ns16450 chips or megacells inside vlsi chips where you ca n't replace them you can id the uart type on your system by running the microsoft diagnostic program  windows msd.exe be sure to run it in dos before bringing up windows the windows serial api may prevent msd from accurately identifying a if you run it from a windows dos prompt the ns16550 uart has separate 16-byte transmit and receive fifos with configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps although with current modem technology there 's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps the has shorted access cycle times than the or the also has dma capability but it is not clear that any pc drivers ever use this for more technical info see national semiconductor application note an-491 so what uart component do you have try to locate the uart on your mother board multi-function i/o card com board or isa/mca modem card if you ca n't find a socketed component with the numbers `` '' or `` '' your com ports are probably buried in vlsi and you wo n't be able to perform a chip replacement if you can disable your vlsi com ports as i chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket com board if you have one or more socketed or chips you can buy plug-in ns16550afn or pc16c550cn low power cmos version ics from several suppliers typically for to each the `` n '' chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package other styles are available but avoid any ns16550 chips without the `` a '' the

upgrade them if you do n't have socketed 8250/16450 chips you 'll need to buy an after- market com or multi-function board if this is a modem card situation you may be hosed to add a new com or multi-function card you 'll need to either disable the com1/2 port s you are replacing or re-assign them to com3/4 although watch out for irq conflicts without turbocom although cheaper cards are

of irqs on my pc so i disabled my built-in vlsi-based ports however with the turbocom driver below i could have set the internals as com3 and using irq sharing the software situation simply upgrading to uarts will not completely solve common overrun problems the standard ms serial drivers do n't take full advantage of the the windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable and the windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations they enable only the receive fifo and only at rates above bps they never enable the transmit fifo which results in an interrupt rate of 10x during uploads they set the trigger level at bytes too high it 's easy for more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the fifo the ports menu of the control panel only allows speeds up to with a v.32bis modem sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1 or more suggesting that a host dte connect rate of 57,600 bps would be effective the api wo n't accept rates above `` cbr_128000 '' the api wo n't let dos programs know there is a there and even if it did dos programs that are n't 16550-aware get little benefit from a port with the standard drivers they do n't allow irq sharing for com3,4 the bios does n't initialize com3,4 properly in many systems windows provides no workaround for apps that do n't provide port speed options above bps these problems are reportedly not solved in windows nt or dos 6.0 and may or may not be addressed in any windows releases after 3.1 but before 4.0 rumors suggest they `` may '' be solved in windows `` 4.0 '' you can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of `` turbocom '' current version 1.2 from bio-engineering research pacific commware division beacon hill lane ashland or 97520-9701 482-2744 voice 482-2627 fax 482-2633 bbs mcimail 344-5374 compuserve 71521,760 price was around as i recall bio-eng is not set up to accept credit cards so i had to send a check egghead and 1-800-software list turbocom but as far as i know they do n't stock it bio is not a software company per se they apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a market for it revised it to be a general purpose com driver suite they recently upgraded it for windows 3.1 it is run-time licensed i now have my host dte connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of my datacomm apps and i am having zero problems with downloads i routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps i am also using 115,200 bps when linking an hp95lx to my pc with lossless bi-directional i/o uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts are still using antique uarts and drivers note that is still the highest rate that the windows 3.1 port menu in control panel will allow in configuring a com port turbocom gets around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real uart rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the windows apis and dialog boxes i also have cts/rts hardware flow control enabled and i suggest that you do the same even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ascii data xon/xoff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control the informal dec standard for xon/xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the xoff from the receiving system or device the byte fifo in the is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on xon/xoff a well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 's ca n't really do cts/rts all by itself in the dos/windows environment so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky even with hardware flow control a with turbocom can still experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress if this is your situation you may need to buy a co-processed com board but this will cost you more than a 16550/turbocom upgrade a review of two such boards and a review of turbocom can be found in the feb'93 issue of `` windows sources '' magazine i suggest trying a 16550/turbocom upgrade first and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a `` power user '' whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems closing soapbox comments the state of rs-232c serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry because it is the oldest standard i/o interface the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies the design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art in my last job with a major workstation vendor i lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system that family of machines was subsequently introduced with ports however this is the exception few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent i/o you may as well learn what you can about serial i/o because this situation shows no sign of improving soon when v.fast arrives i expect cries of outrage from windows users world-wide whose pcs `` sort of '' work today with v.32 but will fail miserably with v.fast without a hardware-buffered uart like the and without software drivers that use that uart to best advantage a v.fast modem will be a waste of money

3, document_id from jayas vast.unsw.edu.au jayasooriah subject experiences with dos i have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week if you do get multiple copies my apologies here is a challenge to microsoft or microsort supporters to defend the pathetic state of dos as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of `` upgrading '' to dos that i have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it my envorinment ============== ti travelmate winsx 486sx/25 4m ram 120m disk system bios version 1.03 05/21/92 by texas instruments cl-gd6420 vga bios v 1.03 a1 by cirrus logic quadtel advance power manager battery.pro v b6.00 by texas instruments smart drive cache win3.1/dos6 parameters a- b- windows benchmark winbench tm v 3.11 02/11/93 by zd labs after `` updgrading '' to dos i could not understand why certain things became so slow especially after i decided to try 'dblspace in the process of finding out why i discovered some interesting things disk performance with double space and smart drive ================================================== while most things did not appear to slow down most of the time certain applications appeared to run very much slower what was interesting is that commands like 'chkdsk and 'defrag were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards i suspected double space ds and decided to measure its impact on my system using winbench tm the real disk winmark of for the original system as shipped from factory with dos and windowws 3.1 became when `` upgraded '' to dos with ds thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than percent which did not really surprise me because i knew that ds compression must cost something specifically for short sequential reads up to bytes ds actually improves transfer rates by about because cpu being faster than i/o more cpu cycles needed for ds is more than compensated by savings in i/o cycles however for all other cases particularly large random writes the transfers take up to three times as long while the performance depends on the type of access i.e random or sequential small or large transfer units on the average based on winbench 's assumptions the disk slows down to half its speed the tests alone done in 'real mode see winbench and with smartdrv on do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance or even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and slow disk i/o this explained why some applications ran markedly slower but not why 'chkdsk and 'defrag the latter especially too so long double space and windows ======================== dblspace will not run at all from within windows not even if you wanted to only to get information not modify anything or for that matter even check on its usage -- try `` fasthelp dblspace '' in a dos box within windows and you will see what i mean from the error message you get how narrow minded can a programer get i wonder yes this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to file manager but this 'mstools dll does not understand a compressed floppy use the dos supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to dos defragmenter is incompatible with ti apm ============================================== defragmentation seemed to take too much time even so i waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm this confirmation 'dblspace /def command for the 120m drive should take no more than seconds much faster on other defragmenters i have used but it took minutes i discovered that if i moved the mouse defragmentation checking ran faster the figure ticked more rapidly it dawned on me that this had to do with ti 's battery saver advanced power management apm module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the cpu is idle and it obviously thought ds defragmentation was an idle process after disabling the ti 's power saver this operation took only seconds microsft programmers think ti4000 and gateway nomad users are idiots ==================================================================== in the readme.txt file you can find the the following running microsoft backup with ti4000 and gateway nomad computers -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- to avoid a conflict between the turbo feature and microsoft backup for windows or ms-dos add a /l0 switch to the device command in your config.sys that loads the battery.pro file or before you run microsoft backup type setpower /l0 at the command prompt if you checked ti 's manual on the /l0 option you will realise that it means `` disable all power saving features of your notebook '' why would anyone want to run a driver disabled as i have found out not only does ti 's power management interfere with microsoft backup as the readme.txt claims but 'chkdsk and 'dblspace and who knows what else are crippled by the ti 's power saver it is obvious that there is not such thing as apm specifications if there indeed is such a thing then either microsoft programmers or ti programmers dont know how to read these specifications you dont have to guess as to who are the idiots by the way if you run the advance power management utility power.exe in dos6 when you check the status it says power management status -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- setting adv max cpu idle of time this figure of seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when i am running nothing windows with only program manager in iconised form does that mean that windows takes up of my cpu all for itself and that i have at best only left for useful work is such an overhead justified whether or not windows is an operating system or just another user interface in dos alone it reports idle time looks like windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that i like my students to study as the classical 'negative' example of our times microsoft programmers do not know batch programming =================================================== i like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this set path=c  dos ... set path=c  etc bin path c  bin ... set path=c  etc windows path c  windows ... set path= path c  bcc bin ... set path= path mouse even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one i.e c  dos dos installation program modifes each and every path statement and prepends c  dos to its value as a result my resultant path has so many dos 's if the installation program wanted to remove the old dos path and add the new dos path clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old dos directory and replace it by the new dos path even this should only be done if the new dos is installed in a directory different from the old one being 'upgraded instead the microsoft programmer if you can call this person one decided to meddle every path statement i had in the autoexec and prepend dos to the value i wonder if microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process i started a thread on this when dos came up and the microsoft representative in singapore called me about this poster in fact he specifically said his us counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet now that has not changed one bit in fact if you have a path statement with path already in it is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason as another example of the inability of microsoft programmers to understand batch programming -- i had the mouse driver invoked as set mouse=c  etc mouse set path= path mouse loadhigh mouse  mouse.com guess what memmaker did it replaced the last statement with lh ... c  etc mouse mouse.com why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with lh and its parameters without touching the rest of the line i do not understand dos software quality ====================== dos is the only operating system i know in which under normal usage you end up creating a file that you can not get rid of using of the commands that come with it i am deliberately being cryptic about this i challenge microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it if they dont within a week i will post how you can create this `` ghost '' file surely if i can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice i am sure two dozen microsoft idiot programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it -- that is what i was told how microsoft `` tests the quality '' of their products i think it is funny that microsoft has found ways to `` test quality '' when it is accepted in the industry that quality can not be tested but can only be built into the product no wonder they can not provide any form of guarantees on their products not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair also if you run 'dblspace /def often enough repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented you may get errors that was created by the defragmenters i got my io.sys file size error and it got truncated when i did the chkdsk this happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since microsft dont you dare reply to this poster on the network

6, document_id from buzz bear.com buzz moschetti subject monthly question about xcopyarea and expose events 2nd posting of the question that just does n't seem to get answered suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the window this action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles '' regular '' expose events e.g window manager-driven exposures take care of rendering the new image using an expose event handler is a `` proper '' way to do this because at the time the handler is called the xlib window is guaranteed to be mapped the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped what we need to do is somehow `` tickle '' the window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior

commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers -- rpw changes as of april revised brake fluid section as non-silicone dot-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw commonly asked automotive questions tire questions q what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean a typically you will see something like 195/60hr14 the is the overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually narrower the is the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width our example tire has a sidewall height of 0.60 ~= mm the is the wheel diameter in inches there are also some special tires called trx' tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like which is in millimeters the r means radial and the h is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate common speed ratings are s 112mph t 118mph h 130mph and v up to 150mph recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designations like 195/60r14 85h the indicates the per-tire load associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice what follows is a table showing a number of load indices and corresponding maximum per-tire loads load index max load kg note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table in some cases the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation indicates passenger car if no letter is given then the application of the tire is passenger car usage as far as i know these letters only appear in the us market the lt designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles for the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all if the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably but may be tires with an ms mud/snow designation may have their speed rating reduced by km/h about 12mph there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature traction and treadwear temperature and traction are graded a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is a numeric rating these values are of limited value as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires q my car has tires with a funny size designation 185/65hr390 can i put normal tires on the car a your tires are called trx tires they were devised by michelin because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible with normal tires michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels and horribly dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed trx type tires are becoming hard to find in addition to michelin avon makes suitable tires goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires q can i rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car a car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok this group includes michelin and goodyear others for example pirelli and nokia will void warranties if such swapping is done the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturer 's recommendations q how many snow tires should i buy and if i buy which end of the car should i put them on a in short and both ends to explain many drivers in areas that don't get excessive snow or who do n't drive agressively or at all in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice with a rear wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car a function of the front axle in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end the primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards radar detectors and speed limits q why are n't there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits in this q a posting a because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between misc.consumers and always start long tedious and pointless flame wars if you want to talk about either of these topics please subscribe to or alt.flame and keep it there safety equipment q do airbags really work a preliminary statistics suggest the following airbags work much better than no belts good point belts alone work much better than airbags alone and airbags point belts work slightly better than point belts alone the con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the driver 's hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but not all may knock the driver 's hands from the wheel making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult brake questions q do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned midas always wants to do this a no there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary if the rotors are not warped warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or to turn them note also that some rotors the rotors on many hondas are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped or badly grooved q they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down is this really a good idea a it used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade prone drum brakes in modern disc brake equipped cars use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases of long steep downhill runs otherwise modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings on the other hand many standard driver 's license tests in the usa still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking i suggest that before taking a us driver 's test you either learn to do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or borrow a car with an automatic to take the test q how often should i replace my brake fluid a probably more often than you do traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid dot-3 type are older fluids dot-4 and dot-5 are newer specifications the principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid dot-3 fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point _requirements_ dot-4 fluids have better boiling point requirements and dot-5 fluids have the best boiling point requirements but dot-5 fluids are not clearly superior see the next q a for more details while the requirements imply that dot-4 fluids are better than dot-3 fluids there may be specific cases where a dot-3 fluid is preferable but these are mostly competition applications otherwise dot-4 type fluids offer _much_ improved brake pedal feel replacement once a year is recommended for dot-4 fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly q what about dot-5 brake fluids a this breaks down in to two parts the dot-5 specification looks excellent for performance but the first dot-5 fluids were silicone based silicone fluids are a tricky proposition unlike dot-3 and dot-4 fluids they do not absorb water at all while this may sound like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring the water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where most of the corrosion occurs because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to silicone fluids two other issues that come up with silicone fluids they are difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and while they generally have much higher boiling points than dot-4 fluids they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling dot-4 fluids silicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications and the economics are questionable for street use i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot-5 standard that do not contain silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older dot-3 and dot-4 fluids but i have little information at this time q abs is available on some of the cars i 'm looking at but it costs more is it worth it a this does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons the short answer is that abs costs more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver that is to say a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques and may require the unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case now for the long answer abs works by monitering the wheels of the car looking for signs of locked brakes it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several systems on the market it can not detect impending lockup which is what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup the sensors used vary some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or oe-equivalent components when the sensors detect lockup the abs system responds by unlocking the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the system if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the abs will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_ then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is achieved this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system cycles the percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the duty cycle typically in an abs system this is about on dry pavement a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking on wet pavement braking is so chancy that abs will outperform threshold braking nearly every time unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked only audi of the manufacturers producing abs-equipped cars has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this eventuality a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves steering control this is the case simply because if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel the abs will release the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied braking distances will lengthen accordingly an important caution abs can not exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on glare ice do n't expect an abs system to help you out very much the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an abs system in your car as far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential restrictions i 've listed above you have to worry about the following parts costs are much higher the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for but the oe master cylinder for the abs-equipped version of the same car lists for over most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot-5 silicone brake fluids in abs-equipped vehicles because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very important q what about this threshold braking business a normally i 'd not put this in the consumers q a but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in abs-equipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is needed here -- rpw threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock 'em up panic habit entirely and is much to be prefered basically the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but just before the wheels lock up entirely drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold feels like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal in many cars you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it in any case if you ca n't hear the tires whine just a bit you're not very near the threshold in a car with abs often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very close to the threshold and they 'll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs take over recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with abs systems the police departments in question quickly blamed the new abs systems but according to autoweek magazine it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by pump braking an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system if you think about it for a minute you 'll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least 1/2 so if you cut the duty cycle of an abs system by that much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs if you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient gas questions q does high octane gasoline help a maybe maybe not some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used on most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well check your owner 's manual for details on what your car needs q my car was made for leaded gasoline will unleaded gas hurt it a it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although the amoco oil company argues otherwise the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead you should however check your owner 's manual many cars from the early 1970s do not actually require leaded gasoline q do fuel treatments help what kind should i use a some do and some do n't during the winter it is a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems never use an additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection manufacturer 's opinions vary on additives containing ethanol sometimes called ethyl alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owner's manual on your car before using these most manufacturers consider ethanol acceptable in gasoline additives with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distillates are fine in fuel injected cars an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain ethanol or methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank there are a small number of particularly good additives these are noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones but work much much better among these are chevron techron redline sl-1 wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg 44k a bottle of one of these once every six months is highly recommended q what about detergent gasolines a the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat bmw has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations if such gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits lubrication questions q what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean a there are several different items encoded there is a two-letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil this looks like se sf cd or such the s codes are for gasoline engine applications the c codes are for diesel engine applications the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed thus sf is considered better than se se is considered better than sd and so forth the more noticeable designation is the oil weight this is either a single number e.g. weight or a pair of numbers separated by the letter w e.g. 10w30 the latter type is much more commonly used these days and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals the first number in the designation 10w is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold the w stands for winter the second number is the viscosity of the oil when hot there is a trick here the oil does n't actually get thicker turn from weight to weight as it gets hotter what is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity of a cold weight oil as it gets hotter it does n't get thin as fast as a 10w oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the viscosity of a hot weight oil note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not all 10w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all weight oils have the same viscosity when hot note also that the novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives and it has been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx 10w40 oils do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time 10w30 15w40 and 20w50 oils work very well though q are quick lube places any good a some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they do n't overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all times q are oil additives like slick-50 or tufoil any good a slick-50 and tufoil are ptfe-based additives many of these have come onto the market recently they are different from the moly-based additives that have been around since the early 's ptfe is the chemical name for teflon tm a trademark owned by dupont in general auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products most usenet responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight increase of mpg after application smoother revving but long term results whether ptfe additives are effective after 5k miles are debatable some manufacturers such as saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage some bmw owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of slick to their cars this writer has been cautioned by a slick-50 dealer that slick-50 should _not_ be used in japanese motors as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine otherwise there are no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives on the other hand there are satified slick customers in the world q do synthetic oils really work a yes but more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely amsoil redline and agip are very highly regarded and very effective mobil synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however q manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals how often should i change my oil a it depends on how you drive if your car always or nearly always gets warmed up and you do n't drive it very hard and keep the revs down the manufacturer 's recommendation is probably fine if however you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it does n't get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at mile intervals given that most manufacturers are now specifying mile intervals if you do n't drive your car much at all say miles a year then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway if you are storing a car during the winter then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage misc questions q my car has a timing belt i hear that bad things happen when they break what 's the story a it depends on the internal design of the motor early ford escorts for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt some honda motors will not be damaged but others will be if no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the belt at least every 60,000 miles some cars may require more frequent replacement ask your dealer or independent mechanic also ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time for example the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake q why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks a for performance reasons compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles q what causes unintended acceleration a the final report of the national highway transportation and safety administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence the nhtsa report goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator is probably the cause -- richard welty
