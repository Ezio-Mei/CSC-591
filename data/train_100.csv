you might not like what bernard lewis writes about label him as a zionist or such to discredit him etc you misrepresent me selim the hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book '' orientalism '' by edward said edward said by the way is a christian not a muslim i think he is pretty much objective in his treatment in `` race and slavery in the middle east '' since he clearly distinguishes between slavery under islam and the practice of slavery in other countries like the us prior to the civil war he also does not conceal that there are verses in the quran which promote the liberation of slaves what he does n't and i do n't think nobody can deduce from these verses is that slavery will eventually be abolished in islamic countries now you might rather conveniently blame the practice of slavery on muslims but the facts are out there i also fail to see the relevance of the claim of lewis being a `` zionist '' to what i wrote regarding bernard lewis him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half-truths about islam read `` orientalism '' by edward said -- see the evidence for yourself in fact i may post some of it here if it is n't too long they were encyclopaedic information which anybody can access that slavery was abolished at certain dates some years after muhammed that this was the cause of tensions in the ottoman empire between the arab slave traders and the government etc .. we also have in the asu library volumes of british documents on slavery where reports and documents concerning slavery all around the world can be found which i checked some of the incidents lewis mentions so i do n't think ones political stance has anything to do with documentary evidence i have n't read lewis 's article so i ca n't comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far that his political motives make him a biased writer on islam his anti-islamic polemics as i understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths again read `` orientalism '' by edward said i am _not_ asking you to take what i say on trust in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get this book it is a well-known book and check the evidence out for _yourself_ the issue i raised was that slaves were used for sexual purposes when it was claimed that islam prohibits extra-marital sex i wrote that the prophet himself had concubines i wrote an incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not want his concubine to get pregnant etc. which is contrary to the notion that `` sex is for procreation only '' in other words such claims are baseless in the quran and the hadith if slavery is _in reality_ as opposed to in the practice of some muslims opposed by islam then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too i seem to be unsuccesful in getting through to you islam is not `` advocating '' slavery slavery was an existing institution in the 7th century it advised on slaves being freed for good deeds etc. which is nothing new many cultures saw this as a good thing what is the problem here but i can argue rightfully that slaves were discouraged about thinking about their statuses politically the quran rewards the good slave so obey your master and perhaps one day you 'll be free but it is very understandable that i do not communicate with muslims since they assume the quran is from a `` god '' and i think it is a rule-based system imposed on the society for preservation of the status quo slaves are a part of this system the subordination of women so that their function in society boils down to child-making is a part of this system etc i understand your point of view selim -- i think rather it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_ some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before regarding women i have made posting after posting on this subject showing that islam is not anti-woman etc however have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them i just reposted a very good one under the title `` islam and women '' reposted from soc.religion.islam if this has already disappeared from your site then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this excellent article imho your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient regarding slaves _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one i made which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year -- is based completely on the qur'an and contains numerous qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the qur'an and hadiths now just because people say they are muslims and perform a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is part of islam even if it is opposed by the qur'an and sunnah no of course not let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you the qur'an prohibits drinking now if a person says `` i am a muslim '' and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean that islam teaches that people should drink beer of course not and only an idiot would think so do you see my point it is very natural to think that the author/authors of the quran had no idea that the socio-economic structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm shifts in years in the western cultures first with the end of the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial revolution well rules have changed and the status quo has driven muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a `` heathen '' world muslim countries have failed economically they were unable to accumulate any wealth directly due to the uncomprimising economic rules in the quran in fact the rise of islam can easily be modeled after the pyramid effect you do not produce any wealth at home but increase your wealth by conquering places you are judging islam here on capitalist terms capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist this does not mean that islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it when this stopped you and i were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour no capital no industry very poor social services the education level in muslim countries are the lowest in the world the health statistics are miserable etc .. one can postulate numerous reasons for this your theory is that it is because islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etc selim i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think as you obviously do that islam lack of education and power for a large part of history the islamic world was very powerful for a significant section of history the islamic world was the foremost in the sciences so to say that islam is for example anti-education is completely absurd you try to blame this situation on islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other reasons for this situation you blame muslims for not following the quran but i blame muslims for following the quran well selim your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of islam i really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are following the qur'an or not your idea is baseless from historical facts it is a poor utopia the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow in your theory it is by `` following the qur'an '' that muslims are backwards in education selim it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory while my ideas are derived from social and economic history you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it so far it seems to me that your view on islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history that you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this my solution to all muslims is simple cut the crap i think selim you should consider taking your own advice get the facts straight here too and work hard to reverse the effects of years of ignorance selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of islam but also of islamic history particularly with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about or so i think yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history selim if i remember right you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from islam i think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues and start _reading_ some of our postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have fred rice darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
1," jbrown batman.bmd.trw.com subject re death penalty gulf war long in article 930420.105805.0x8.rusnews.w165w mantis.co.uk mathew mathew mantis.co.uk writes jbrown batman.bmd.trw.com writes in article 930419.115707.6f2.rusnews.w165w mantis.co.uk mathew mathew mantis.co.uk writes which `` liberal news media '' are we talking about western news in general but in particular the american `` mass media '' cbs nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of `` those poor poor iraqis '' along with `` look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits '' most odd over here there was very little about the suffering of the iraqi civilians until towards the end of the war and then it was confined to the few remaining quality newspapers true at first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets but later and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone it seemed to me that they did n't have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare it 's like they were only pro-gulf-war as long as it was `` nice and clean '' smart missiles dropping in on military hqs but not when pictures of dead dying and maimed civilians started cropping up what naive hypocrites how about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in ww2 i do n't hear you bemoaning them discussion about blanket-bombing and a-bombs deleted all things considered the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick ^^^^^^^^^ end to avoid even greater allied losses i should have said here `` militarily justified '' it seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning `` morally justified '' i apologize what about the evidence that america knew japan was about to surrender after hiroshima but before nagasaki is that another lie peddled by the liberal media conspiracy i have often wondered about this i 've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on japan 's island fortress of truk a good inpenatrable military target the second bomb could 've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be but i digress yes i have heard that we found evidence after the war btw that japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb unfortunately the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the us's ulimatum therefore the second bomb was dropped most unfortunate imo i for one do n't regret it nuke a jap for jesus i do n't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions ... why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet if iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before we started bombing i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply he had to be stopped oh i see so we can overlook his using chemical weapons on thousands of people but if he threatens your right to drive a huge gas-guzzling car well the man 's got ta go actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us and allied action if some back-water country took over some other back-water country we probably would n't intervene not that we don't care but we ca n't be the world 's policman or if a coup had occured in kuwait instead of an invasion then we still would n't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to saudi arabia but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west 's oil interests caused us to take action i 've moved a paragraph from here to later on ... if we had n't intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement right but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action or are you just setting up a strawman i 'm not setting up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective i guess we should n't have fought ww2 either -- just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg yes do germans are human too you know sure what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for a `` thousand year reich '' the consequences stemmed from that translation `` they were asking for it '' well in a sense yes they probably had no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to but what about those who did n't support hitler 's dreams of conquest it's not as if they democratically voted for all his policies the nsdap got in the elections of and that was the last chance the german people got to vote on the matter they suffered along with the rest why does this bother you so much the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others it it regretable but that 's the-way-it-is there are no perfect solutions ... i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and tibet what should i say about them anything in particular the people of east timor are still being killed by a dictatorship that invaded their country hell even western journalists have been killed all this was happening before the gulf war why did n't we send in the bombers to east timor why are n't we sending in the bombers now probably because we 're not the saviors of the world we ca n't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other places here 's that paragraph i moved what 's your intent to sound like a loving christian well you aren't doing a very good job of it well it 's not very `` loving '' to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion so i 'd have to say yes stopping hussein was the most `` loving '' thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest the chinese government has a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization of tibetans tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed amnesty international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china why are n't we stopping them in fact why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them tell me how we could stop them and i 'll support it i for one do not agree with the present us policy of `` sucking up to them '' as you put it i agree that it is deplorable and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of `` not guilty '' yes amongst the things i thought were `` hmm there 's an awful lot of white people in that jury '' so it was the policemen on trial not rodney king erm surely it 's irrelevant who 's on trial juries are supposed to represent a cross-section of the population are they or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order i 'm not an expert on california law or even us law but it seems that this is the way the system is set up you can criticize the system but let 's not have unfounded allegations of racial prejudice thrown around and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers you are saying that black people are not the peers of white people no not at all the point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow this idea of people only being tried before a jury of people just like them is really stupid should the nuremburg trials have had a jury entirely made up of nazis germans perhaps `` peers '' does n't mean `` those who do the same thing '' like having murderers judge murderers it means `` having people from the same station in life '' presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent 's motivation s those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone who 's lying defenceless on the ground it 's rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have been so it 's `` hard to imagine '' so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of `` constructing a logical argument '' we 're not talking about a logical argument we 're talking about a court of law as the faq points out some fallacious arguments are not viewed as fallacies in a court of law ok granted however you are using this reasoning as part of your logical argument in this discussion this is not a court of law if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then i feel the `` not guilty '' verdict was a reasonable one were you not talking earlier about the bias of the liberal media conspiracy the media is not totally monolithic even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the macneil-lehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush btw i never used the word `` conspiracy '' i do n't accept without far more evidence theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources `` thou shalt not kill ... unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way as unfortunately it can not be helped '' -- jim brown bible for loving christians thanks mathew i like the quote pretty funny actually i 'm a monty python fan you know kind of seems in that vein of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already ha ha only serious i an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people you a supposed christian are arguing that it 's ok to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as well hardly i did n't say that it 's a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just unfortunately we do n't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions if one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die i did n't say it is ok -- it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary i a moral relativist am arguing that saturation bombing of german cities at the end of world war ii was as far as i can see an evil and unnecessary act i would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering i 'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say that conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved and perhaps it was unnecessary as let 's say we now know that doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb did n't see it as being necessary rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision at the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it but do n't assume that i feel the bombing was morally justified -- i do n't i just do n't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that i am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the war you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist i as an absolutist am in a position to judge but i defer judgment you are arguing that the actions need to be assessed in the particular context of the time and that they might have been moral then but not moral now wrong they were neither moral then nor now they seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision where 's your christian love where 's your absolute morality oh how quick you are to discard them when it suits you as ivan stang would say `` jesus would puke '' one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum i understand the full ramifications of that and i am prepared to do so i do n't believe that you can make the same claim mathew and btw the reason i brought up the blanket-bombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being '' so deplorable '' yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing was n't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bombing was the norm so the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww2 even with precision bombing mistakes happen and some civilians suffer but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history many iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids the stories of `` hundreds of thousands '' of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk yes bunk the us lost 230,000 servicemen in ww2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting but we are expected to swallow that `` hundreds of thousands '' of civilian iraqis died in a war lasting about months and with the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that what hogwash if `` hundreds of thousands '' of iraqi civilians died it was due to actions hussein took on his own people not due to the allied bombing regards jim b"

1, spbach lerc.nasa.gov james felder subject re some thoughts in article saturn.wwc.edu bissda saturn.wwc.edu dan lawrence bissell writes first i want to start right out and say that i 'm a christian it makes sense to be one have any of you read tony campollo 's book- liar lunatic or the real thing i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy just what organization did he belong to does it have a name the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was logic alert artificial trifercation the are many other possible explainations could have been that he never existed there have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that jc is an amalgam of a number of different myths mithra comes to mind some reasons why he would n't be a liar are as follows who would die for a lie would n't people be able to tell if he was a liar people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed call me a fool but i believe he did heal people logic alert argument from incredulity just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it is n't true liars can be very pursuasive just look at koresh that you yourself site he has followers that do n't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die by not giving up after getting shot himself koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes as far as healing goes if i rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels in one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today seems to me that the early gospels were n't that compeling so the stories got bigger to appeal better niether was he a lunatic would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy very doubtful in fact rediculous for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away therefore since he was n't a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing or might not have existed or any number of things that is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into there are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives however if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices i have given at least one valid alternative so the conclusion that jc is the real mccoy just because he is n't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid some other things to note he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in hrs alone this in his betrayal and crucifixion i do n't have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it jc was a rabbi he knew what those prophecies were it would n't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy what would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies and jc had absolutely no knowledge of then yet fullfilled them anyway i do n't think most people understand what a christian is it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god 's sake he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same hey we ca n't do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him that 's tuff and most people do n't want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time we do n't rush it in one day christianity is your whole life it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while we box everything into time units such as work at this time sports tv social life god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves here i agree with you anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously and what it says is that it must be a total way of life i have very little respect for xians that do n't if the myth is true then it is true

slaughter tens or even hundreds o thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oil^h^h^hkuwait we won the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century let 's analyze this claim a little how is the `` size '' of a war defined by number of participants geographical area number of countries involved number of casualties size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries too are all measures of size in this case i 'd say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area which other `` comparable '' wars are we talking about vietnam and korea might make good comparisons which `` liberal news media '' are we talking about western news in general but in particular the american `` mass media '' cbs nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of `` those poor poor iraqis '' along with `` look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits '' this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently i suspect that medical advances may have something to do with it too i agree how about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in ww2 i do n't hear you bemoaning them perhaps because the topic has n't cropped up if you want my opinion i think that the blanket bombing of german cities at the end of world war two was the most appalling act of wholesale slaughter this country has committed in centuries bomber harris was no hero of mine perhaps so and maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too but that 's easy to say from our `` enlightened '' viewpoint here in the 's right back then it was all-out war and germany and japan had to be squashed after all a million or more british had already died hundreds of thousands of french a couple hundread thousand or so americans and millions of russians not to mention a few million jews poles and other people of slavic descent in german concentration camps all things considered the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses i for one do n't regret it war is never an exact science but with smart bombs it 's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties sometimes mistakes are made targets are misidentified innocents die that 's war the way it really is entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests without regard for the lives of other people that is the way war really is sure and it 's the people who suffer because of them all the more reason to depose these `` entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests '' or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet if iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before we started bombing i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply he had to be stopped sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the west before hussein invaded kuwait but it is still hussein who is responsible for his decision to invade and once he did so a strong response from the west was required mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here you come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot although i feel sure that was not your intent what 's your intent to sound like a loving christian well you aren't doing a very good job of it well it 's not very `` loving '' to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion so i 'd have to say yes stopping hussein was the most `` loving '' thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest so the iraqi war was wrong eh i 'm sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in ww2 eh who even mentioned appeasement and what makes you think the situation is even remotely analogous to world war two i mentioned it if we had n't intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement it is precisely the lessons the world learned in ww2 that motivated the western alliance to war letting hitler take austria and czechoslavkia did not stop ww2 from happening and letting hussein keep kuwait would not have stopped an eventual gulf war to protect saudi arabia i guess we should n't have fought ww2 either -- just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg yes do germans are human too you know sure what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for a `` thousand year reich '' the consequences stemmed from that tyrants like hussein have to be stopped his kind do n't understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun my only regret is that bush wimped out and did n't have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people 's sacrifice not to mention the americans who died was for naught i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and tibet what should i say about them anything in particular and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of `` not guilty '' yes amongst the things i thought were `` hmm there 's an awful lot of white people in that jury '' so it was the policemen on trial not rodney king and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers if there had been black officers involved i 'm sure their would have been black jurors too this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone who 's lying defenceless on the ground it 's rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have been so it 's `` hard to imagine '' so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of `` constructing a logical argument '' can we expect another revision soon just kidding if there is some wonderful evidence why is it seemingly being kept secret why not tell everyone what it is then everyone could say `` oh yes you're right king deserved a good beating '' and we could all live happily ever after i have to admit that i wonder this too but neither the prosecution nor the defense is talking so one can not conclude either way due to the silence of the principals law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be criminals or cops one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one 's guilt and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict fine but i 'm still finding it hard to imagine what the `` reasonable doubt '' was in this case i mean the cops certainly seem to be beating someone who 's lying defenceless on the ground what 's your explanation mass hallucination orbital mind-control lasers faked video footage do tell ok it certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved and frankly the original `` not guilty '' verdict baffled me too but then i learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm a charge which news commentators said was akin to attempted murder under california law based on what the prosecution was asking for it 's evident that the first jury decided that the officers were `` not guilty '' note not `` not guilty '' of doing wrong but `` not guilty '' of aggravated assault with the intent of inflicting serious bodily harm the seeds of the prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then i feel the `` not guilty '' verdict was a reasonable one mathew `` thou shalt not kill ... unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way as unfortunately it can not be helped '' -- jim brown bible for loving christians thanks mathew i like the quote pretty funny actually i 'm a monty python fan you know kind of seems in that vein of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already regards jim b. loving christian

doing so but it seems you are implying that the person accused of blowing up the wtc in ny actually did it and that islamic teachings have something to do with blowing up the wtc wtc world trade centre which was the building that was blown up i think okay ... to make some comments ... the person has only been accused -- innocent until proven guilty remember secondly there seem to be some holes in his accusation that i read about for instance if they guy used that particular van to blow up the building and then to go back and claim his deposit back afterwards he must be incredibly stupid perhaps salamen was one of those `` uneducated '' muslims we hear so much about nevertheless he was apparently smart enough to put together a very sophisticated bomb it does n't seem to fit together somehow actually salameh was not the only person involved the other fellow was a chemical engineer working for allied signal who had specifically studied explosive devices in school believe it or not we actually allow radical muslim types to study things like this in our universities so much for the price of freedom what i read the other fellow told salameh how to put it together over the phone the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a i assume complicated sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ one must need some brains i would expect despite this there have already been many attacks and threats against mosques and muslims in the united states as a consequence of his accusation i have read o.k. now please tell us where this is happening i live in the u.s. and i have heard very little about these mosque attacks there are many mosques in houston texas and i would like to know what is going on so i can verify this or is the great jewish media conspiracy keeping us from knowing about this in the u.s. we heard about the mosque attacks during the desert storm venture so why is it so quiet now maybe it is localized to new jersey i read this in an article in `` the australian muslim times '' the newspaper weekly of the australian muslim community if this is true perhaps one of the muslims based in north america if they see this posting can elaborate islamic teachings teach against harming the innocent in the qur'an it explicitly teaches against harming innocents even in times of war the blowing up of the wtc and harming innocents is therefore in blatant contradiction to islamic teachings this means absolutely nothing plenty of people commit violence while following what they think are valid religious principles i have seen people post many things here from the koran which could be `` misinterpreted '' if that is the explanation you wish to use by an `` uneducated '' muslim to allow them to harm idolators and unbelievers the first thing every muslim says is that no muslim could have done that because islam teaches against harming innocents and we are supposed to take you word that it never happens what do you think is the consequence does allah strike them down before the `` alleged '' violence occurs of course not muslims commit the violent act and then everyone hides behind verses in the koran we're pretty hip to that trick and i even doubt that it will come up in the trials '' my defense is that i am muslim and islam teaches me not to harm the innocent therefore the people who were killed must not have been innocent sure we set off the bomb your honor but you must remember sir i am a muslim allah is all-powerful allah would not have allowed this are you insulting my religion '' great defense eh just admit that there are some incredibly stupid violent muslims in the world and stop hiding from that fact it does no one any good to deny it it only makes the more reasonable muslims look like they are protecting the bad ones can you see that i do n't deny this fact the thrust of my argument here is that a salameh is according to us law innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law as his guilt has not been established it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption b islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents if muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that islam teaches this -- perform such actions it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of islam but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the teachings of islam this is an important distinction i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say `` muslim '' in general anyone who calls themselves a `` muslim '' and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam is considered to be a muslim thus one who might do things contrary to islam through ignorance for example does not suddenly _not_ become a muslim if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential principles though then one does leave islam the term `` muslim '' is to be contrasted with `` mu'min '' which means `` true believer '' however whether a muslim is in reality a mu'min is something known only by god and perhaps that person himself so you will not find the term mu'min used very much by muslims in because it is not known to anybody except myself and god whether i for example am a `` true believer '' or not for example i could just be putting on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what i write here without anyone knowing thus when we say `` muslims '' we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress islamic teachings by '' muslim '' we do not necessarily mean `` mu'min '' or `` true believer '' in islam fred rice darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au

'' that can be tested and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction '' this drug will relieve pain ... '' people 's ideas about the age of object x are not objective you can have any idea you like and i ca n't stop you universae and their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you dislike some detail of them that 's a problem with your opinion of them sure assume an objective reality and you get statements like this i claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such subjective and individual if i 'm wrong then some more-or-less objectively `` real '' thing exists which you label `` objective morality '' can you back up this positive claim of existence can you back up your positive claim above no that 's because it 's an assumption i make the same assumption about values on the basis that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical basis of the two is precisely the same point morals are in essence personal opinions usually ideally well-founded motivated such but nonetheless personal the fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question sometimes even for the same reason does not make morals objective it makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question which can be good for the evolution of a social species and if a `` real large lot '' nice phrase of people agree that there is a football on a desk i 'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two perhaps you can explain the difference to me since you seem to see it so clearly take a look on the desk i.e. perform a test if football then accept theory else do tell people they 're hallucinating now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform me which way to look and why to look that particular way as opposed to some other get my drift no just look are you claiming never to know what good means science is a whole other matter altogether says you prove that those who disagree are wrong that 's a simple matter of proving the track record of the scientific method i think it 's great and should be applied to values i may be completely wrong but that 's what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought -- frank o'dwyer i 'm not hatching that' odwyer sse.ie from `` hens '' by evelyn conlon

1, mathew mathew mantis.co.uk subject alt.atheism faq constructing a logical argument archive-name atheism/logic alt-atheism-archive-name logic last-modified april version 1.4 constructing a logical argument although there is much argument on usenet the general quality of argument found is poor this article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference concise oed logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable the matter is very much open for debate this document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical argument a proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example `` it is raining '' or `` today is tuesday '' propositions may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false note that this is a technical meaning of `` deny '' not the everyday meaning the proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express it so `` god exists '' and `` there exists a god '' both express the same proposition an argument is to quote the monty python sketch `` a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition '' an argument consists of three stages first of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated these are called the premises of the argument they are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as `` because '' '' since '' `` obviously '' and so on the phrase `` obviously '' is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises if something does n't seem obvious to you do n't be afraid to question it you can always say `` oh yes you 're right it is obvious '' when you 've heard the explanation next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference in inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted there are various forms of valid inference the propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference inference is often denoted by phrases such as `` implies that '' or '' therefore '' finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as `` therefore '' `` it follows that '' `` we conclude '' and so on the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference for example every event has a cause premise the universe has a beginning premise all beginnings involve an event premise this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolation sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion this is perfectly valid if sometimes a little confusing recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument some statements look like arguments but are not for example '' if the bible is accurate jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the son of god '' this is not an argument it is a conditional statement it does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but we'll come to those later another example '' god created you therefore do your duty to god '' the phrase `` do your duty to god '' is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument finally causality is important consider a statement of the form `` a because b '' if we 're interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence the statement is an argument if we 're trying to establish the truth of b then it is not an argument it is an explanation for example '' there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start '' -- this is an argument `` my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine '' -- this is an explanation there are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive a deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true a deductive argument is either valid or invalid a valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is true an inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are there are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds this is because of the slightly counter-intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions for example all insects have wings premise woodlice are insects premise therefore woodlice have wings conclusion here the conclusion is not true because the argument 's premises are false if the argument 's premises were true however the conclusion would be true the argument is thus entirely valid more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in all fish live in the sea premise dolphins are fish premise therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we can not do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises we can therefore draw up a `` truth table '' for implication the symbol `` '' denotes implication `` a '' is the premise `` b '' the conclusion `` t '' and `` f '' represent true and false respectively premise conclusion inference a b a= b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- f f t if the premises are false and the inference f t t valid the conclusion can be true or false t f f if the premises are true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid t t t if the premises are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true a sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true a sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments to delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy it is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument these pitfalls are known as fallacies in everyday english the term `` fallacy '' is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs this is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing so for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely by studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them the following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal to force the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion it is often used by politicians and can be summarized as `` might makes right '' the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer for example '' ... thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell '' argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem is literally `` argument directed at the man '' the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion this is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it for example '' atheism is an evil philosophy it is practised by communists and murderers '' sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known perjurer this is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is false to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent 's particular circumstances for example '' it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food how can you argue otherwise when you 're quite happy to wear leather shoes '' this is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent 's argument this fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion for example '' of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing you 're white '' this particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as `` poisoning the well '' argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium means `` argument from ignorance '' this fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific principle examples '' of course the bible is true nobody can prove otherwise '' `` of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist nobody has shown any proof that they are real '' note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur for example '' a flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth the earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles therefore no such flood occurred '' in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred we can not conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however argumentum ad misericordiam this is the appeal to pity also known as special pleading the fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted for example '' i did not murder my mother and father with an axe please do n't find me guilty i 'm suffering enough through being an orphan '' argumentum ad populum this is known as appealing to the gallery or appealing to the people to commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people this form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language for example '' pornography must be banned it is violence against women '' `` the bible must be true millions of people know that it is are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools '' argumentum ad numeram this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum it consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion for example '' isaac newton was a genius and he believed in god '' this line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject for example we can distinguish quite clearly between '' stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation '' and '' john searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer '' hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed searle is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose `` accidental '' circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable it is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific for example '' christians generally dislike atheists you are a christian so you must dislike atheists '' this fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules converse accident hasty generalization this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident it occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases for example '' jim bakker was an insincere christian therefore all christians are insincere '' sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter a sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these are known as false cause fallacies the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause for example '' i took an aspirin and prayed to god and my headache disappeared so god cured me of the headache '' the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event for example '' the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons '' cum hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc it asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause s of the events petitio principii this fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached circulus in demonstrando this fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument for example '' homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefore homosexuals can not be allowed to hold government office '' note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the conclusion an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the british secret services official ban on homosexual employees another example is the classic '' we know that god exists because the bible tells us so and we know that the bible is true because it is the word of god '' complex question fallacy of interrogation this is the fallacy of presupposition one example is the classic loaded question '' have you stopped beating your wife '' the question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked this trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination when they ask questions like '' where did you hide the money you stole '' similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as '' how long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continue '' or '' does the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization '' ignoratio elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion for example a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of christianity are undoubtably true if he then argues at length that christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that christian teachings are true sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument for example '' what could be more affordable than free software but to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable '' amphiboly amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing accent accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning in this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized for example consider '' we should not speak ill of our friends '' and '' we should not speak ill of our friends '' fallacies of composition one fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole for example '' the bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very lightweight '' the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items for example '' a car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses '' fallacy of division the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition like its opposite it exists in two varieties the first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts for example '' you are studying at a rich college therefore you must be rich '' the other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item for example '' ants can destroy a tree therefore this ant can destroy a tree '' the slippery slope argument this argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful events there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event for example '' if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we 'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare therefore we can not legalize marijuana '' `` a is based on b '' fallacies `` is a type of '' fallacies these fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar examples '' is n't history based upon faith if so then is n't the bible also a form of history '' `` islam is based on faith christianity is based on faith so is n't islam a form of christianity '' `` cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so are n't dogs a form of cat '' affirmation of the consequent this fallacy is an argument of the form `` a implies b b is true therefore a is true '' to understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier denial of the antecedent this fallacy is an argument of the form `` a implies b a is false therefore b is false '' again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa the latter has the form `` a implies b a is false therefore b is false '' where a does not in fact imply b at all here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce anything about b converting a conditional this fallacy is an argument of the form `` if a then b therefore if b then a '' argumentum ad antiquitam this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because `` that 's the way it 's always been '' argumentum ad novitam this is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else argumentum ad crumenam the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right argumentum ad lazarum the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier this fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard an `` argumentum ad nauseum '' is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something bifurcation also referred to as the `` black and white '' fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist plurium interrogationum many questions this fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question non sequitur a non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it red herring this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyone 's attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing shifting the burden of proof the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made the source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise straw man the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else 's position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished it is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made the extended analogy the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other this fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti-cryptography legislation '' i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it '' `` such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported martin luther king '' `` are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for black liberation how dare you '' tu quoque this is the famous `` you too '' fallacy it occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it for instance '' you 're just being randomly abusive '' `` so you 've been abusive too '' ÿ

10, document_id from cmeyer bloch.stanford.edu craig meyer subject re jack morris michael chen mike cunixf.cc.columbia.edu wrote in any case i think viola would have made a better signing why viola is younger and is left handed how many left handed starters does toronto have well i agree that viola is a better signing however why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters i understand lefthanded spot relievers even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters i just do n't understand why people insist on lefthanded starters unless there is a park effect e.g. yankee stadium most batters in mlb are righthanded so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters i guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to lhp 's than rhp 's however this is probably only a factor in the postseason because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season i think you just want the best starters you can get regardless of whether they are lefties or righties lefthanded starters tend to have higher era 's than righthanded starters precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties or perhaps because of the platoon advantage am i missing something here -- craig

so what do you say do n't you think he deserves it i mean heck if dave winfield ho-hum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why do n't we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon i am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and i can not without having stats to back up my points however i think you approached this the wrong way i believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman does i feel they were all much better players i am not saying i fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more imho dave kingman definately not they guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag the rest of his career i do not think he was very feared by pitchers i also do not think he did a lot for the game i mean really i am a met fan he was a met for part of his career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame dave winfield i think so he is feared by pitchers he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are in my opinion without stats better than kingman 's probably by quite a bit i also perceive him to be a leader maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader i think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done i know some of this from when he was with the yankees i think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the hall of fame i think it deserves some consideration lee smith maybe i would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of kingman darrell evans no eddie murray maybe he has had a very good career he is a leader although a silent one he is a good role model are the stats good enough i am not sure but i would once again believe they are much better than kingman 's both the average as well as the power numbers but not as good as winfield 's just think eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years jeff reardon my guess is no but it kind of depends on his numbers off the top of my head i would take lee smith first well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by today 's standards marginal honestly ozzie smith and robin yount do n't belong there they 're both shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal well i strongly disagree here both of these guys deserve it for sure i talked about leadership above both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers offensively the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop he would have shattered aaron 's home run mark by now how many of those great plays saved games how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game while i believe both of these guys have numbers baseball is about more than numbers or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame as does george brett who also belongs in this class of player let 's be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something is n't done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan steve garvey i am not sure probably not but i guess i could see someone making a case for him jack morris once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up his name kirby puckett probably the only reason i do not say definately is he still has time left in his career if he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately nolan ryan is there really any doubt i think i heard something about him having some records maybe they were not all good i do n't know i did not hear any of them just the number he has the numbers he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model i would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of his accomplishments no-hitters strikeouts respectable numbers even with some weaker teams you can go on and on i really hope he gets all the possible votes so in summing up i have groups those that belong those that probably do but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying do n't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go yes winfield yount brett not in your mail o. smith puckett and ryan maybe murray and l. smith no reardon garvey morris evans and definately kingman as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this up these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions mike q steve

president clinton to ncaa division i champion hockey team april q a following to national desk contact white house office of the press secretary 202-456-2100 washington april -- following is a transcript of remarks by president clinton to the university of maine `` black bears '' ncaa division i hockey champions the rose garden 9:58 a.m. edt the president good morning ladies and gentlemen it's an honor for me to welcome the university of maine black bears the winner of the ncaa division i hockey national championship to the rose garden and the white house i understand from senator mitchell that this is the first team from the university of maine every to win a national championship and we 're glad to have them here i 'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory coming from a state that is also relatively small in size but also filled with pride and tradition and community i can understand how the people of maine must feel about the black bears in our state people are still talking about the time we won the orange bowl over the number one ranked football team and that was back in i 'm sure that years from now the people of maine will as proud of this team as they are today you know in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey we do n't have a lot of ice laughter but after spending three months getting banged around in this town i can understand a little more about hockey than i did before i came here hockey is a tough game it 's a hard-hitting sport it does have one virtue though there 's a penalty for delay of game i wish we had that rule in the senate laughter in government as in hockey leadership is important in the united states senate our team has a great captain the majority leader and the senior senator from maine george mitchell junior senator -- cohen looks so young i ca n't imagine laughter i'm actually bitter about senator cohen because he looks so much younger than me on your hockey team the captain jim montgomery has done a great job he scored the winning goal late in the championship game leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else i know a little bit about sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities i share the pride that senator mitchell and senator cohen and congressman andrews and all the people of maine must feel for the black bears who have shown us all how to play as a team how to bring out the best in one another and how to come from behind i think it 's important as i ask young people from around america who have achieved outstanding things in working together to come here to the white house to be recognized and appreciated by their country to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives we now have another role model and i 'm glad to have them here today applause the president is presented with team jersey applause the president that 's great i love it it 's beautiful applause the president is presented with an autographed stick the president thank you that 's great applause q mr. president did you authorize the move on waco this morning sir the president i was aware of it i think the attorney general made the decision and i think i should refer all questions to her and to the fbi q did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed the president no they made the tactical decisions that was their judgment the fbi q is this a raid the president and i will -- i want to refer you to -- talk to the attorney general and the fbi i knew it was going to be done but the decisions were entirely theirs all the tactical decisions q what did you and senator mitchell talk about this morning q any chance for that stimulus package the president senator mitchell ought to pay my quarter laughter i was in there -- laughter senator mitchell you have to pay that quarter the president i was ready laughter senator mitchell he 's worth a quarter any day q any chance for your bill sir the president we talked about what was going to happen this week in the senate and about what other meetings we 're going to have for the rest of the week we only had about five minutes to talk and we agreed we 'd get back together later around noon and talk some more q senator dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise the president well i know he did but look senator dole and a lot of the other republicans now in the senate voted for the same kind of thing for ronald reagan in and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of emergency spending measures totalling over billion when reagan and bush were president in those administrations and many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the american people back to work i do n't want to go back and revisit every one but you can do it you can look at the research there so this position they 're taking is not credible we have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan all these costs are covered during that time and then some and the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for do n't have much of a history on which to base their position they 've got years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the american people back to work so i think we 've got a chance to work it out and i 'm hopeful we 'll see what happens today and tomorrow i 'm feeling pretty good about it the press thank you end 10:10 a.m. edt -30- -- canada remote systems toronto ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044

11, document_id from nlu xenon.stanford.edu nelson lu subject sharks review part left wings apparently part defensemen numbered through was lost when i posted it to make things worse i lost my own copy i have asked on the sharks mailing list on which it did get out to see if someone can mail me a copy back if someone responds i will repost it when i get it otherwise i will re-write it in a day or two and post it sorry about that larry depalma season 3rd acquired '91-92 free agent from minnesota grade i c-/d+ no netter/fan watching the sharks including me knows where depalma was at the end of the season the sharks appeared to still have his rights but he was n't in san jose he was n't in kansas city and his name has n't appeared on the waiver wire and that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for depalma after being called up october against the tampa bay lightning depalma had an excellent week scoring points in games while playing good defense unfortunately the 27-year-old depalma then disappeared the rest of the way getting just more points in more games and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice he then was sent down to kansas city walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of shark bytes as the mailing list is now known to sharks officials faithful and neither the sharks nor we miss him johan garpenlov season 3rd acquired '91-92 trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and 8th round pick in '92 entry draft from vancouver grade a/a- after an early slump garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way finishing with points in games second highest total on the team as he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau kisio got most of the credit but garpenlov finishing second in the mvp voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders getting a club-high power- play goals contrary to his previous rep garpenlov also showed that despite his small size '' lbs he was willing to throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet he also still needs to work on his defense although he improved tremendously throughout the season and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season he will be a major key to the offense next year david bruce season 5th acquired '91-92 from st. louis in expansion draft grade i after a banner '91-92 when he led the team in power-play goals and was third in total scoring points in games bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury which kept him out of the lineup for all by games this season of course it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury but the 28-year-old bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the sharks first season and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well the injury appears serious which is a shame because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead his future with the sharks next season appears clouded mark pederson season 3rd acquired '92-93 trade with philadelphia for c/lw dave snuggerud grade i b it is difficult for me to understand the flyers decision to unload pederson after a very good offensive season last season points in games but after riding the pine early in the season pederson was summarily sent to the sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded snuggerud and he finished with games combined with the flyers and the sharks he was also limited by injuries this season and this limited his production points but when healthy pederson appears impressive with a good scoring touch good size and the willingness to throw it around although he 's not considered a physical forward and good speed he also does not appear to be a liability on defense but the sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much exactly pederson can do john carter season 4th acquired '91-92 free agent from boston grade i b+/b carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team and the hard work worked wonders as at times he looked great on ice however although he did look great at times the fact that he received just points in games for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do and the sharks confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about games left in the season carter who will turn on may always hussled but as a result was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but he was generally a credit on the defensive end but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity and he did not impress offensively although he was one of the best sharks at drawing penalties he is very unlikely to be back next season jean-francois quintin season 1st acquired '91-92 from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i b+/b i do n't understand why the sharks did n't let quintin play any more than the games he played this season he was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively and appeared at age ready for regular nhl duty at least for a team like the sharks finishing with points in those games while not being a defensive liability shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited quintin the team 's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two to just games with the sharks and the blades that season but he looked impressive he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season mark beaufait season 1st acquired 2nd round pick in supplemental draft grade i after a all-star season at kansas city beaufait got a cup of coffey with the sharks late in the season when the blades knocked down a playoff spot and the sharks decimated with injuries playing games and scoring a goal for his only nhl point thus far despite small size '' lbs beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary and looked pretty good at times although it 's too early to judge him based on nhl games in which he played mostly left wing away from his center position at northern michigan and kansas city jaroslav otevrel season 1st acquired 8th round pick in entry draft grade i like beaufait otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea games midway through the season he was generally very much of a defensive liability and did not show much offensively either although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those games he may need another season to work on his defense but once his defense is acceptable he should be ready michel picard season 1st acquired '92-93 trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau grade i b-/c+ the 23-year-old picard although he perennially tore up the minors seems to be close to being out of chances for some reason after being acquired by the sharks but failing to impress the management in games scoring goals for his only points and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city he was not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors he has failed thus far to score in the nhl although he has been given limited opportunities he may be the sharks bait in the expansion draft dody wood season 1st acquired 3rd round pick in entry draft grade i d+/d although perhaps i should n't give a grade at all i have been accused of knocking on wood too much then it is probably no surprise to you that i am thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far although games is a small example he was generally a nonfactor on offense was not particularly good defensively and took too many silly penalties losing many fights in the process and gathering penalty minutes in those games projecting to to in an 84-game season he 's not ready and needs at least another season at kc where he can work on his fighting skills if nothing else his relatively small size '' lbs does not give much possibility that he can survive at this stage as an enforcer =============================================================================== go calgary flames al macinnis for norris gary roberts

are posted with his permission the implications of some details are fascinating -- -- -- date sat apr 23:05:23 pdt from `` martin hellman '' hellman isl.stanford.edu to a long list of recipients subject clipper chip most of you have seen the announcement in friday 's ny times etc about nist national institute of standards technology announcing the `` clipper chip '' crypto device several messges on the net have asked for more technical details and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news articles so here to help out is your friendly nsa link me i was somewhat surprised friday to get a call from the agency which supplied many of the missing details i was told the info was public so here it is the cc of this to dennis branstad at nist is mostly as a double check on my facts since i assume he is aware of all this please let me know if i have anything wrong the clipper chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in silicon each chip will have two secret 80-bit keys one will be the same for all chips ie a system-wide key and the other will be unit specific i do n't know what nist and nsa will call them but i will call them the system key sk and unit key uk in this message the ic will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be kept secret aside it is clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and in my opinion it may be as much for that as this stated purpose the unit key will be generated as the xor of two 80-bit random numbers k1 and k2 uk=k1+k2 which will be kept by the two escrow authorities who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the attorney general but it was stressed to me that they will not be nsa or law enforcement agencies that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased when a law enforcement agency gets a court order they will present it to these two escrow authorities and receive k1 and k2 thereby allowing access to the unit key uk in addition to the system key each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired call this key plain old k. when a message is to be sent it will first be encrypted under k then k will be encrypted under the unit key uk and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key sk producing e e m k e k uk serial number sk when a court order obtains k1 and k2 and thence k the law enforcement agency will use sk to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link aside it is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links with or without a court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow this gives the agency access to e m k e k uk serial number in the above message they then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the `` watch list '' for which they have a court order if so they will decrypt e k uk to obtain k and then decrypt e m k to obtain m. i am still in the process of assessing this scheme so please do not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed scheme all i am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledgably but i will say that the need for just one court order worries me i would feel more comfortable though not necessarily comfortable if two separate court orders were needed one per escrow authority while no explanation is needed the following story adds some color in researching some ideas that silvio micali and i have been kicking around i spoke with gerald gunther the constitutional law expert here at stanford and he related the following story when edward levi became pres ford 's attorney general right after watergate he was visited by an fbi agent asking for `` the wiretap authorizations '' when levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank signed forms every time levi did not comply and changed the system but the lesson is clear no single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps or worse yet divulging of personal keys sometimes he or she will be an edward levi and sometimes a john mitchell martin hellman -- -- date sun apr 11:41:42 pdt from `` martin

sparse in their requesting further info from me or asking for comments on specific questions by this posting i apologize for any messages i am unable to respond to i already spend too much time answering too much e-mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other responsibilities i note a probably correction sent to me by dorothy denning she met with the person from nsa that i talked with by phone so her understanding is likely to better than mine on this point where i said the transmitted info is e e m k e k uk serial number sk she says the message is not double encrypted the system key or family key as she was told it is called only encrypts the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted unit key this is not a major difference but i thought it should be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to my attention it makes more sense since it cuts down on encryption computation overhead

12," document_id from denning guvax.acc.georgetown.edu subject revised technical summary of clipper chip here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors and provides some additional information and explanation the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning revised april introduction on april the president announced a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement at the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the `` clipper chip '' together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key chip contents the clipper chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called `` skipjack '' the algorithm uses bit keys compared with for the des and has rounds of scrambling compared with for the des it supports all des modes of operation the algorithm takes clock ticks and in electronic codebook ecb mode runs at mbits per second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips n a 30-bit serial number this length is subject to change u an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip the chips are programmed by mykotronx inc. which calls them the '' myk-78 '' the silicon is supplied by vlsi technology inc they are implemented in micron technology and will initially sell for about each in quantities of 10,000 or more the price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at t telephone security device as it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key k with the device at the other end this key negotiation takes place without the clipper chip in general any method of key exchange can be used such as the diffie-hellman public-key distribution method once the session key k is established the clipper chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitized voice the telephone security device feeds k and m into the chip to produce two values e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which are transmitted over the telephone line the law enforcement field thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n all encrypted under the family key f. the law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed the ciphertext e m k is decrypted by the receiver 's device using the session key d e m k k m chip programming and escrow all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif secure compartmented information facility which is essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about chips are programmed during a single session the scif is located at mykotronx at the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent enters a secret random 80-bit value s1 into the laptop and agent enters a secret random 80-bit value s2 these random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers thus the unit keys are a function of secret random bits where each agent knows only to generate the unit key for a serial number n the 30-bit value n is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block n1 s1 and s2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt n1 producing a 64-bit block r1 r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1 similarly n is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce n2 and n3 and two additional 64-bit blocks r2 and r3 are computed r2 e d e n2 s1 s2 s1 r3 e d e n3 s1 s2 s1 r1 r2 and r3 are then concatenated together giving bits the first bits are assigned to u1 and the second bits to u2 the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u1 and u2 u1 and u2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies as a sequence of values for u1 u2 and u are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u1 the second disk is similar but contains the u2 values the third disk contains the unit keys u agent takes the first disk and agent takes the second disk thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts however the agent does not know the other bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seeds s1 and s2 and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the clipper chip the law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key f giving e k u n. documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number n is then sent e.g. via secure fax to each of the key escrow agents who return e.g. also via secure fax u1 and u2 u1 and u2 are xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u is decrypted to get the session key k. finally the message stream is decrypted all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder capstone the next generation a successor to the clipper chip called `` capstone '' by the government and `` myk-80 '' by mykotronx has already been developed it will include the skipjack algorithm the digital signature standard dss the secure hash algorithm sha a method of key exchange a fast exponentiator and a randomizer a prototoype will be available for testing on april and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in june or july acknowledgment and distribution notice this

12, document_id from silly ugcs.caltech.edu brad threatt subject remote file system security in light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals i 'd love to see a unix-based encryption scheme that kept some files encrypted on the host machine say all the files in your home directory used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a modem line it seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not among other things i 'd love to know about potential security holes in such a system does such a system exist if it were made easy-to-use and readily available i think it would be a good thing tm i realize that this would probably just involve putting a nice front-end on a readily available and very secure encryption scheme but it should be done thanks for the ear brad
12, document_id from pmetzger snark.shearson.com perry e. metzger subject are we being hysterical no in article 1qpg8finn982 dns1.nmsu.edu amolitor nmsu.edu andrew molitor writes in article tcmayc5m2xv.jex netcom.com tcmay netcom.com timothy c. may writes but is it any worse than the current unsecure system it becomes much worse of course if the government then uses this `` clinton clipper '' to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption this is the main concern of most of us i think the camel 's nose in the tent etc not to pick on mr. may in particular of course but is n't this kind of the domino theory as john gilmore has pointed out repeatedly if you produce the infrastructure that would permit a police state to function all that is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of attitude on the part of the government our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country they designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise for instance one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime think i jest john hancock made all his money smuggling rum which is after all a drug think about it the government has everyones keys in escrow and the fbi gets their pet `` wiretap without leaving the office '' scheme there is a coup which happens every day all around the world within hours everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible without the tools being in place a tyranny can not stand with tools like this in place a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed why give the government tools with which to enslave you maybe you can trust bill clinton but are you willing to tell me that you can trust every government that will ever arise in the u.s. hereafter i am not willing to make that leap of faith -tim may whose sig block may get him busted in the new regime ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ is n't this just a little melodramatic i 'm a political dissident as such i am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world in most of the world i could be killed for my beliefs call amnesty international some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world all that seperates the u.s. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the national archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years governments throughout history have fallen no government has lasted for more than a few hundred years often they are replaced by dictatorships do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it if we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than bill clinton have fallen to dictatorship rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny i for one am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere -- perry metzger pmetzger shearson.com -- laissez faire laissez passer le monde va de lui meme

12, document_id from tfs gravity.gmu.edu tim scanlon subject re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key-escrow after reading the debate over the clipper i have a few things to add first most of the people i know who activly use encryption privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the us all they care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not that after all is the bottom line second if i look at all the people i know who use any form of encryption at all and this group spans people from the morons who still insist that the des is a good and secure standard to people looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies i can not think of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves their methods open to abuse the clipper does this because people make mistakes by nature and the us government is made up of people who are just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else third since most of the people i know are at least marginaly familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption stratigies i ca n't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the clipper chip that despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it so i can not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip fourth when it comes to criminal abuse sure there are many stupid people out there and yes some will be open to being caught via the built in back door of the clipper chip however anyone who is going to do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going to run into that problem pretty damned fast and i would assume start looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption if nothing else were avalible none of this would be an issue however the truth is that most private encryption users that i 've ever run into simply do not give a damn about the legal status of rsa or pgp or anything else if it works they use it this is not going to change either i do not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be slowed down by the advent of the clipper chip it is all to easy to convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is if anything the clipper chip just adds another tool to the user the bottom line here is that people will use what works and unavoidibly i 'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy the other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is out of the bag or if you have an interest in snooping pandora 's box has been opened and this is not going to change i 've seen a blindness to this that i 've found utterly stunning and the clipper chip along with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger degree sincerly tim scanlon -- tfs gravity.gmu.edu

afterlife.ncsc.mil robert ward writes in article bontchev.734981805 fbihh bontchev fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de writes and since the us constitutions guarantees the right to every american to bear arms why is not every american entitled as a matter of have you read the applicable part of the constitution and interpreted it in context if not please do so before posting this misinterpretation again it refers to the right of the people to organize a militia not for individuals to carry handguns grenades and assault rifles read it again yourself then re-apply the admonition you gave to the previous poster to yourself as well the first clause is not a condition it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right which exists militia or not that the people have a right to keep and bear arms this is not a right granted by the constitution it is a right presumed to exist by default the constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall not infringe mess with block limit that right remember the constitution is a bunch of negative things things the government can not do all rights etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the people the same people the other amendments in the bill of rights talk about since i am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation i am appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself and you i suspect i am sure you will find his qualifications adequate if that is n't enough i can send you the senate subcommitee to the judiciary on the constitution report on the same thing ... there are some things in there that big brother types like biden etc must have really had to swallow hard to admit i think you will find that people that seriously study the constitution and state what it means will say the same thing those who come up with 'new improved meanings are those who are trying to subvert the constitution for a given agenda like clinton and his clinton cripple gun control people control and control control and the whole nasty mess please tell us how this person is in error wo n't you and please back it up with some proof since i am backing my assertion up with independent proof and have a bunch more i can provide ... note followups set to talk.politics.guns -- -- -- -- begin included article -- -- -- the unabridged second amendment by j. neil schulman if you wanted to know all about the big bang you 'd ring up carl sagan right and if you wanted to know about desert warfare the man to call would be norman schwarzkopf no question about it but who would you call if you wanted the top expert on american usage to tell you the meaning of the second amendment to the united states constitution that was the question i asked a.c. brocki editorial coordinator of the los angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton mifflin publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system mr. brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud a retired professor journalism at the university of southern california and the author of '' american usage and style the consensus '' a little research lent support to brocki 's opinion of professor copperud's expertise roy copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at usc since copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for `` editor and publisher '' a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field he 's on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary and merriam webster 's usage dictionary frequently cites him as an expert copperud's fifth book on usage `` american usage and style the consensus '' has been in continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since and is the winner of the association of american publisher 's humanities award that sounds like an expert to me after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why i was interested i sent the following letter '' i am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in english usage to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united states constitution and extract the intent from the text `` the text of the second amendment is a well-regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed `` the debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed `` i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent further since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the second amendment i ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary '' my letter framed several questions about the test of the second amendment then concluded '' i realize that i am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter i am doing so because as a citizen i believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results i ask that you do this because of that importance '' after several more letters and phone calls in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the second amendment gun control or any other political subject professor copperud sent me the follow analysis into which i have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity copperud `` the words a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of july constitutes a present participle rather than a clause it is used as an adjective modifying 'militia which is followed by the main clause of the sentence subject 'the right verb 'shall the to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia `` in reply to your numbered questions schulman `` can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to a well-regulated militia '' copperud `` the sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people '' schulman `` is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms granted by the words of the second amendment or does the second amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed '' copperud `` the right is not granted by the amendment its existence is assumed the thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia '' schulman `` is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia is in fact necessary to the security of a free state and if that condition is not existing is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed null and void '' copperud `` no such condition is expressed or implied the right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia no condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state the right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence '' schulman `` does the clause a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence '' copperud `` the right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional as previously stated it is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia '' schulman `` which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia mean 'well-equipped 'well-organized 'well-drilled 'well-educated or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority '' copperud `` the phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military '' schulman `` if at all possible i would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words or usage since that sentence was written years ago but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors unless those issues can be clearly separated '' copperud `` to the best of my knowledge there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment if it were written today it might be put `` since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged schulman `` as a 'scientific control on this analysis i would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the following sentence '' a well-schooled electorate being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed `` my questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be '' is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other identical to the second amendment 's sentence and '' could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read books _only_ to a well-educated electorate -- for example registered voters with a high-school diploma '' copperud `` your 'scientific control sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure `` there is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation '' professor copperud had only one additional comment which he placed in his cover letter `` with well-known human curiosity i made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used but was unable to reach any conclusion '' so now we have been told by one of the top experts on american usage what many knew all along the constitution of the united states unconditionally protects the people 's right to keep and bear arms forbidding all governments formed under the constitution from abridging that right as i write this the attempted coup against constitutional government in the soviet union has failed apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard 's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power and here in the united states elected lawmakers judges and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the constitution of the united states ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely american citizens are put in american prisons for carrying arms owning arms of forbidden sorts or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the constitution and even the american civil liberties union aclu staunch defender of the rest of the bill of rights stands by and does nothing it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right no one else will no one else can will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights and continue regarding them as representing us if they do will we continue obeying judges who decide that the second amendment does n't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their orwellian doublespeak or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice as the constitution of the united states promises us we can and

'' powered draft cooling towers low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site are quite popular with fossil plants fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling-water reactor nuclear plants there 's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses vintage steam technology so it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible hence big cooling towers oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one canadian official asked about `` thermal pollution '' de-icing a river said `` up here we view heat as a resource '' actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size the issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine the condenser pressure is normally water 's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes since the condenser is at a very low pressure the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity if the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps how much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell typically hotwell temperatures run between and degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped when the river water temperature is high in the summer operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding degrees a vast difference from the typical '' 95-95 '' days degrees humidity we see routinely in the east it is not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser can not handle the heat load without excessive pressure everybody runs closed-cycle boilers the water used is purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it so the boiler water is recycled true actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water by `` impure '' i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few ppm of dissolved oxygen secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory john -- john de armond wd4oqc |interested in high performance mobility performance engineering magazine tm interested in high tech and computers marietta ga send ur snail-mail address to jgd dixie.com perform dixie.com for a free sample mag lee harvey oswald where are ya when we need ya

13, document_id from schmidt auvax1.adelphi.edu subject grounding power wiring was re a question about 120vac outlet wiring there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here a few points need to be clarified the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects it should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation `` orange '' outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems the code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either the grounded conductor of a circuit often called the neutral which is referred to in the code as the `` identified '' conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel this connection is through the main bonding jumper in many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor in the case of a volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions if you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end if the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the `` u '' ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential the difference under normal non short-circuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two this normally does not present a shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path if the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat with the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling this is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the `` hot '' conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy do n't flame me on this i 'm just telling you where the field comes from not it 's health effect as far as i 'm concerned the jury is still out on this note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at any sub distribution panels this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before u ground outlets and such the appliance manufacturers do n't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors do n't want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the volt `` hots '' except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings it 's primarily for lightning protection people doing wiring should be aware what is and what is n't a legal grounding conductor obviously the bare wire in `` romex '' 'with ground is anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you do n't have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes `` greenfield '' looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is not a legal grounding conductor as it does n't have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield `` wiremold '' is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the `` feed '' to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were `` hot '' with volts why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can `` bond '' the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should ground the green wire/lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it the interrupter does n't depend on the ground to trip it is desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfi 's read in the nec 210-7 d exception this is the code my '93 code is in the city but i know the rule has n't changed it might be renumbered though we have only touched the surface

john sorenson carol sigelman carla moore barbara moose judith schrier again thank you to all who gave i have been using wordscan plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review the product wordscan plus is a product of calera recognition systems it runs under windows 3.1 and supports that accufont technology of the hewlett packard scanners when initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options text graphics input source ie scanner fax file disk file automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document i would like scanned and in what order once an image is scanned you can bring up the pop-up image verification the software gives you two `` errors '' at this point blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary yellow shade which are words that wordscan plus does n't think it converted correctly at all i have found that the software should give itself more credit it is usually correct instead of wrong if a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about words i find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary after a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate tiff or pcx file format i was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files i use hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april an intel satisfaxtion card which stores incoming faxs in a pcx/dcx format while most of my faxes were received in `` standard '' mode 200x100 dpi the accuracy of wordscan plus was excellent overall a very impressive product the only fault i could find is the limitations of the size of the user dictionary specialized words is just too small if

diseases ============================ source mmwr date apr introduction despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early 1970s the u.s. public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes e.g. escherichia coli o157 h7 hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings e.g. hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the u.s. health-care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs this issue of mmwr introduces a new series `` emerging infectious diseases '' future articles will address these diseases as well as surveillance control and prevention efforts by health-care providers and public health officials this first article updates the

diseases br div of bacterial and mycotic diseases national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note e. coli o157 h7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated preliminary data from a cdc 2-year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e. coli o157 h7 that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8 of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e. coli o157 h7 often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after 6-8 days but -7 of patients develop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of -5 this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e. coli o157 h7 in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e. coli o157 h7 using smac agar when infections with e. coli o157 h7 are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases e. coli o157 h7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the u.s. department of agriculture 's food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e. coli o157 h7 entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to f 86.1 c fda personal communication regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e. coli o157 h7 and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e. coli o157 h7 references cdc preliminary report foodborne outbreak of escherichia coli

14, document_id from robin ntmtv.com robin coutellier subject critique of pressure point massager as promised below is a personal critique of a pressure point massager i recently bought from the self care catalog i am very pleased with the results the catalog description is as follows the pressure point massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a professional shiatsu masseur the powerful motor drives two counter-rotating `` thumbs '' that move in one-inch orbits -- releasing tension in the neck back legs and arms pressure point massager a2623 to order or receive a catalog call hours days 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021 note when i ordered the massager the item number was different and the price was not when i received it i glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one i was quite annoyed to see a difference in price i called them about it and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although it looks and works exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as a reason for return in fact since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory i received this one in days he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives then return the old one very reasonable people i have long-term neck shoulder and back pain if i were a building i would be described as `` structurally unsound i have stretches and exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illness not enough time lazy etc the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to further strain even with exercise i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p.t the tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headache sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye when my physical therapist has massaged my neck and the sub-occipital muscles in particular the knobby areas near the base of the skull the headache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged i ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishing someone would invent -- a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient p.t appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessary i have been using it for about a week or so now and love it the base unit is about a '' x '' rectangle about 3-3/4 '' high with handles on each side and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal `` thumbs '' are about 1-1/2 '' in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2 '' above the base the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable they are located more toward one end rather than centered see figure below they move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions depending on which side of the switch is pushed and are very quiet it can be used from either side for instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it _______________________________ __ _______________ __  ^^/  ^^/ || || |_______________| |__| |__| |_______________________________| for the neck/head the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or neck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting or standing applying pressure with the arms/wrists since my wrists are also impaired i 'm typing this over an extended period of time and i do n't have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works well for me for my back i sit in a high-backed kitchen chair position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massaged and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it for my back this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used `` home-made '' massager of tennis balls taped together with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tennis balls are better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are not in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i do n't pin it up first as far as i 'm concerned the easier something like this is to use the more likely i 'll use/do it if there are multiple considerations/hassles i 'm more likely to not bother with it not only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles however i overdid it and pressed too hard against it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for a few days i laid off it for about days and applied ice which helped after that i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back which is the most vulnerable point for me it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades although again it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at a time to really work it out i highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although i can not vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy since i 've had it such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after too i have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so this was very timely for me this is the 1st product i 've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker the catalog states they have been in business since it contains quite a few health care products and while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do definitely a step above some other ones i 've seen such as `` dr. leonards health care catalog '' or `` mature wisdom '' i 'm only but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists no big surprise here i consider many of those products to be rip-offs particularly targeted toward the elderly with dubious health benefits i apologize for the length of this but it 's the kind of info _i_ would like to know before ordering something thru the mail robin coutellier northern telecom mountain view ca internet robin

14, document_id from heart access.digex.com g subject cholistasis sp /fat-free diet/pregnancy hi i 've just returned from a visit with my ob/gyn and i have a few concerns that maybe y'all can help me with i 've been seeing her every weeks for the past few months i 'm at week and during the last visits i 've gained to 1/2 pounds every weeks she said this was unacceptable over any week period as it stands i 've thus far gained pounds also she says that though i 'm at weeks the baby 's size is weeks i think she mentioned inches for the top of the fundus when i was weeks the baby 's size was weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and i 've had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway that 's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about 2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i was n't eating very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results well now i only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut the fat it was n't as much of a problem so the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but i 'm still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken w/o skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet e.g bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i ca n't even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed i 'm concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if i 'm not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if she 's concerned about fat i 'm not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i ca n't seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and she 's taken it all off and has n't had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like i 'm being 'punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet i would understand if she had said low-fat diet since i 'm trying that anyway even if she said really low-fat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a high-fat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation i 'm not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated i 'm truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and i 'll end up having to eat constantly thus far i do n't find any foods satisfying thanks g

see a very large gathering to welcome dr. teperman wednesday april k of c uniondale last meeting it has been noted here before that the long island chapter of trio has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather being able to forecast rain sleet and snow fully a month in advance no tv weatherman can match us this time we not only scored again but we were also able to disable the long island railroad making travel really difficult none the less many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation our scheduled speaker mrs. elizabeth linnehan a professional nutritionist had a family emergency and was not able to attend she hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications however ms. jennifer friedman an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice ms. friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup even a bit for men to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take we are most grateful to jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening annual meeting in addition to welcoming dr. teperman the april meeting is also the annual meeting of the chapter this is the official notice of the meeting as required by our by-laws the main purpose of the meeting is to review

floor will be open for any new business suggestions or comments anyone would like to bring up we will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with dr. teperman

14, document_id from mmm cup.portal.com mark robert thorson subject re barbecued foods and health risk i do n't understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that `` it would not be legal in the u.s. '' i think that naturally occuring substances excluding `` controlled '' substances are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additives or other `` consumption '' it 's only when the chemists concoct sp an ingredient that it falls under fda regulations otherwise if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything how in the world do you suppose it 's legal to `` consume '' tobacco products which probably should be banned no there is something called the `` delany amendment '' which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount this was passed by congress in the 's before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude this is why things like cyclamates and red were banned they are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the act they are banned this also applies to natural carcinogens some of you might remember a time back in the 's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good and never tasted so good again that was the time when safrole was banned this is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves if it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someone would do it in order to make money the fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect an odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as `` gumbo file '' this is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves this is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natural form so maybe that 's how they evade delany or maybe a special exemption was made to appease powerful louisiana democrats

14, document_id from banschbach vms.ocom.okstate.edu subject candida yeast bloom fact or fiction i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it 's environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like elaine in sci med nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack could it just be professional jealousy i could n't help elaine or jon but somebody else did could they know more than me no way they must be a quack i 've been teaching a human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are those that were raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school switched to the vegan diet typically this is about 1/3 of my class of students those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class that 's okay because i know that some of what i 'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few `` enlightened '' physicians practicing in the u.s it 's really too bad that most u.s. medical schools do n't cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the medical profession in animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with `` good '' bacteria after antibiotics are stopped medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with `` good '' bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier steve got real upset with elaine 's doctor because he was using anti-fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine 's doctor a quack here is a brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsible for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeast-like fungus an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis candidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an e. coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level diabetes or an oral course of antibiotics has been used in diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose candida unlike bacteria is very limited in it 's food fuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers the bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not is n't certain when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to `` treat '' it if it 's internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane `` barrier '' if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all american 's die with less vitamin a than they were born with u.s. autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom while diabetics can suffer from a candida `` bloom '' the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr. steve dyer says but even in patients being given the anti-fungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed lack of a `` good '' bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from it 's name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina l. acidophilius is the predominate bacteria unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics in the gi system the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it 's nice to know that i do n't have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quack candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment the vagina becomes alkaline during a woman 's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract i would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti-fungal creams this was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem recurring vaginal yeast infections this m.d did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and l. acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile after three treatments sex returned to our marraige i have often wondered what an m.d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non-existent syndrome the nonpathogenic bacteria l. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b-complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b6 and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy some of the above material was obtained from `` natural healing '' by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it 's not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut if steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor 's use of vitamin a and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart 's content if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone i would n't have a problem with your behavior martin banschbach ph.d professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and

'' i think that no there is something called the `` delany amendment '' which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount this was passed by congress in the 's before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude this is why things like cyclamates and red were banned they are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the act they are banned this also applies to natural carcinogens some of you might remember a time back in the 's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good and never tasted so good again that was the time when safrole was banned this is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves if it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someone would do it in order to make money the fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect an odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as `` gumbo file '' this is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves this is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natural form so maybe that 's how they evade delany or maybe a special exemption was made to appease powerful louisiana democrats i think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to commercially produce/sell food with carcinogenic substances it is not illegal for people to do such to their own food smoking etc is this true

miracles of our parent 's doing for a decade and more the pundits have told us `` you 've lost it '' the `` me '' generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past you and i have even begun to believe the pessimists we listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs living history they are we are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it a few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as general bernie schriever told of his team 's work and yes struggle to build this nation 's intercontinental ballistic missile what stories can we tell blurry-eyed telescopes thousand dollar toilet seats even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time they are and seem destined to remain gen. schriever 's icbms i find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old minuteman and poseidon ballistic missiles well the pessimists are wrong the legacy is continuing this event is proof to our technological parents we 've listened to your stories we 've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit and we 've learned from your achievements and your mistakes let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history max hunter you are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration your insight and discipline built the thor icbm later incorporated into today 's most successful launch vehicle the delta you told us in the 's that a new form of launch vehicle a single stage reusable rocket can and should be built you advocated this idea tirelessly it was elegantly simple as are all great breakthroughs you showed us how to build it you convinced us it could be done you are working by our side to weld its components into place most important you reminded us of a prime engineering principle undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 's and 's build a little and test a little and max you passed all of this on to people like pat ladner who started this program for the sdi douglas aircraft did n't start with a dc-10 they did n't even start with a dc-3 our grandfathers built a little tested a little even sold a little and made a little money before they moved on to the next step they did n't take a decade or more before putting the first `` rubber on the road '' max hunter you did n't take ten years to build thor and by god we 're not going to take ten years to show that low cost single stage reusable aerospace transportation is real we ended the cold war in a few short years it took the same team here today but a few years to show through the strategic defense initiative that the cold war must end we you and us launched a series of satellites the delta experiments in about a year apiece this more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the soviet union those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship but it is the same team which is now putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation we will make space access routine and affordable we built this magnificent flying machine in two years this summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket it will allow us to use space rapidly affordably and efficiently as no other nation can and yes we 'll make a little money off it too then and only then we 'll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system the dc-3 of space will be a reality we may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries what a wonderful irony if this sdi product and russian efforts to counter sdi merge to power mankind 's next step to the stars to be sure we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer robert goddard 's first rockets were n't saturn v 's if we succumb to the temptation to ask for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system we will fail max hunter and his colleagues showed the way three years and a cloud of dust in our case rocket exhausts

15," document_id from jbh55289 uxa.cso.uiuc.edu josh hopkins subject rimsat us/russian joint venture i 've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest i 've transcribed some of my notes below since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine permission is granted to copy this without restriction michael sternberg cheif of operations of rimsat was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control disarmament and international security rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launchers and satellites i think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the international relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson went to tonga to visit a friend while he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king who happened to be a big tv fan matt bought the king a satellite dish which the king thought was really nifty since tonga has a gnp of about million his majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this matt thought there probably was so at his suggestion tonga applied for geosynchronous satellite slots while this is n't entirely off the wall it was very unusual seeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and is a lot of slots the whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions supporting tonga 's case eventually tonga ended up with slots ranging from e to e slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside according to sternberg four of these from e to e are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat was formed to use these slots it was officially formed in nevis as a tax haven they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to fill slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately billion it 's not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh terms that i do n't think i 'll visit there for a long time besides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way that people operate for example `` everybody can sell you everything '' everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for satellites at a cost of million however glavkosmos lost favor after the coup sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures since glavkosmos was out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms eventually he worked out a deal and on dec he met with koptev who heads the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat the next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware npo applied mechanics -- npo pm to use their acronym this organization is located in siberia ca n't figure out how to spell the town i need an atlas and has built about vehicles since the dawn of the space age sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites they are hard workers honest people who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners at this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners sternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm his company is apparently lookng for million to invest in the firm to become partners.it apparently costs the russians about million to build a satellite that would sell for million in the west if you want to give them specifications they 'll build you a satellite for the particular satellites that rimsat will be using costs run about 378,000 per transponder year this compares to 810,000 t/y in the u.s they can sell their time for about 1.1 million compared to 2.6 million in the u.s. rimsat will launch their satellites on protons to get the best prices they bought in bulk they have the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians which is being moved into place now tidbits sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big business because big business is just like what they have over there except that `` we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier '' russian launches are self insured the promise to replace a failed launch within months major investors in rimsat include russell 20/20 which is a huge retirement fund organization cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast asia and a fund operated by some of the big names in u.s aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off he downplayed the instabilites in the ex-ussr saying that we are worried partly because we are n't used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying monolith italy gets a new government `` every two weeks '' but we do n't worry because we 're used to it he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in russia we wo n't worry about their stability as much part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting in their coffers and replacing the rest with the `` equivalent '' value in rubles to get around this rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites which was rather reassuring the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the older gorizont horizon satellites have a lifetime of about years while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about years while this is much shorter than years for western satellites sternberg downplayed the difference at these prices they can afford to launch new ones in addition shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date hardware -- josh hopkins jbh55289 uxa.cso.uiuc.edu `` find a way or make one ''

16, document_id from ide twelker uunet.uu.net steve twelker subject re the arrogance of christians why do we follow god so blindly have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog the answer is quite simple -- the dog can see and the blind person can not ... of course you may ask if i can not trust my own senses how do i know whether what i see and hear about god is truth or a lie that is why we need faith to be saved we must force ourselves to believe that god knows the truth and loves us enough to share it with us even when it defies what we think we know why would he have created us if he did not love us enough to help us through this world seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and reality on your own you would n't need to rely on doctrines that need to be updated my experience of christianity 25+ years is that most christians seek answers from clergymen who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matters and that most of these questions can be answered by simple introspection most people suspect that they can not trust their senses but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves not to get too esoteric but it seems that most religions christianity included are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this stuff deleted as for you no one can `` convert '' you you must choose to follow god of your own will if you are ever to follow him all we as christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from god if you reject that we have to accept your decision although we always keep the offer open to you if you really want to find out why we believe what we believe i can only suggest you try praying for faith reading the bible and asking christians about their experiences personally .... and what if the original poster pixie is never `` converted '' does it make sense that she or i or the majority of humanity for that matter would go to hell for eternity as many christians believe it makes more sense to me that rather than be converted to a centuries-old doctrine that holds no life for her that she simply continue to decide for herself what is best -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- you may be right about christians relying on clergy but i have some reason to hope you 're not protestants emphasize conversion experience of the holy spirit and use of the bible this is intended to make sure that christians have religious experience of their own and that they have some basis on which to judge claims of clergy and other christians i ca n't speak for catholics and orthodox but i believe they also attempt to avoid having members who simply repeat what they are told i admit that this is n't always successful -- we certainly see young people join our church because at that age parents expect it but most of our members do seem quite able and willing to make judgements for themselves and have a commitment that comes out of their own experience unfortunately it 's the nature of usenet that doctrinal disagreements get emphasized so it looks like we spend most of our time dealing with doctrine that 's certainly not my experience of the way christians really live -- clh

16, document_id from db7n+ andrew.cmu.edu d. andrew byler subject monophysites and mike walker mike walker if you are using the standard formula of fully god and fully human that i 'm not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human i think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity it 's a consequence of the fall jesus is human but not a fallen human -- clh the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism this was a heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in ad it grew up in reaction to nestorianism which held that the son and jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox it believes that jesus christ was god which is correct that he was man which is correct that he was one person which is correct but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy which is heretical the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies both divine and human though the wills were in perfect harmony that is what mike is trying to get across that while jesus came in human form mike says he did not have a human nature or a human will in reality he had both though neither made him subject to original sin it is interesting to note that the monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies it also was condemned at a late council in constantinople i believe andy byler these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it 's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology i do n't think there 's any question that there is a problem with nestorius and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical but i 'd like to be a bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought more moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox e.g theodore of mopsuestia my impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition not just nestorius version and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox -- clh

=============================================== the ahmadiyya movement in islam an international organi- sation was found in in qadian india the founder of this movement hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad 1835-1908 was proclaimed to be the promised reformer of this age as foretold in the scriptures of almost all major religions of the world he claimed to be the fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of jesus christ metaphorically the muslim mahdi and the promised messiah the claims of hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition which are often witnessed in the history of divine reformers even today this sect is being persecuted especial- ly in some of the muslim regimes the right of ahmadi muslims to openly practice their religion and to define themselves as muslims has been severely restricted in many muslim countries the united nations human rights organizations such as amnesty international and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the members of this movement but so far to no avail despite the opposition and persecution the movement cont- inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the world in over countries who come from diverse ethnic and cul- tural backgrounds the movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards developing a better understanding of all religions ahmadi muslims have always been opposed to all forms of violence bigotry reli- gious intolerance and fundamentalism among its many philanthropic activities the sect has es- tablished a network of hundreds of schools hospitals and clinics in many third world countries these institutions are staffed by volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's internal resources the movement stresses the importance of educa- tion and leadership its members have included a high number of professionals as well as world class individuals the ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform establish peace and justice and to unite mankind under one universal brotherhood newsgroup creation ================== the discussion for

16, document_id from jek cu.nih.gov subject when are two people married listowner i have sent this to mr anderson privately post it only if you think it of general interest here is a copy of something i wrote for another list you may find it relevant a listmember asks what makes common-law marriages wrong a common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself there is nothing in the bible old or new testament about getting married by a preacher or by a priest jewish or christian and in fact jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings there is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman in fact the traditional christian view at least in the west is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage and that the clergyman is there only as a witness however the essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife forsaking all others till death do them part the reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society and the couple themselves may be clear about whether a commitment has been made suppose that we do away with the public ceremony the standard vows etc instead we have a man and a woman settling down to live together after a year or so the man says to the woman hey honey it was great while it lasted but i think it 's time to move on she says what are you talking about he says i am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and younger she says but you ca n't we are married he says what are you talking about we never got married she says i remember distinctly what you said to me the night we first made love you said `` my love for you is as deep as the ocean as eternal as the stars as long as i live i am yours utterly and completely when i lie on my deathbed my last feeble breath will utter your name my ... '' he says oh that that was just rhetoric just poetry when a man is in a romantic mood he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that you must n't take them literally and that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record the church insists on it because it is her duty among other things to give moral advice and you can not give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom if anybody and vice versa the state insists on it since the state has a concern with property rights with child care and support and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom prospective fathers-in-law insist on it because they don't want their daughters seduced and abandoned prospective spouses insist on it because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment or just `` poetry '' and persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric this is the real thing hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment the church goes further and insists that when christians marry a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the church not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the christian teaching about marriage is and that they are in fact promising to be married in a christian sense the church also prefers a standard marriage vow and is wary of letting couples write their own vows for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract certain language has been repeatedly used in wills and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it try to say the same thing in your own words and you may find that the probate judge 's interpretation of them is not at all what you intended similarly the church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether `` you are my main squeeze '' and `` i am here for the long haul '' do in fact cover the same territory as `` forsaking all others '' and `` till death do us part '' this topic has come up on the list before is there any topic that has n't one listmember was asking `` if a couple love each other and are living together is n't that marriage in the eyes of god '' eventually someone asked `` in that case what is their status if they break up is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce are they in a relationship that god forbids either of them to walk out on `` the original questioner said `` good grief i never thought of that '' in fact there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says `` we do n't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other '' is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother at this point someone may say `` none of this applies to me and my mate we are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment 'for better or worse forsaking all others till death us do part so in our case no ceremony is needed '' to this my reply would be the reason for requiring a driver's license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road what is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers but the existence of dangerous drivers however testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road therefore the state rightly makes and enforces such laws and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are back to the original question we have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around years he asks at what point did they stop fornicating and start being married i answer at the point if any where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other for better or worse as long as they both lived if they have accepted such an obligation what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of say a justice of the peace yours james kiefer

contributions in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views my comments are based primarily on william rusch 's historical summary in `` the trinitarian controversy '' fortress i 'm going to save this as an faq -- clh major views of the trinity second century the writers of the 2nd cent are important because they set up much of the context for the later discussions justin martyr aristides athenagoras tatian and theophilus of antioch are known as the '' apologists '' their theology has often been described as `` logos theology '' based strongly on wording in john they took more or less a two-phase approach through eternity the logos was with the father as his mind or thought this `` immanent word '' became '' expressed '' as god revealed himself in history ultimately in jesus thus jesus full distinction from the father only became visible in history though the logos had been present in god from eternity rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position but in a form which is less sophisticated because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the godhead irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the apologists however he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach he still viewed god as one personage with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation the `` economy '' the distinctions are present in his essential nature irenaeus emphasized the holy spirit more than the apologists irenaeus views should probably be called `` economic trinitarianism '' though that term is normally used as below to refer to later developments third century -- clh dynamic monarchianism source theodotus adherents paul of samosota artemon socinus modern unitarians perception of god 's essence the unity of god denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person the son and the holy spirit therefore are consubstantial with the father 's divine essence only as impersonal attributes the divine dunamis came upon the man jesus but he was not god in the strict sense of the word perception of god 's subsistence the notion of a subsistent god is a palpable impossibility since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible the 'diversity of god is apparent and not real since the christ event and the work of the holy spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within god not to a hypostatic union asignation of deity/eternality father unique originator of the universe he is eternal self-existent and without beginning or end son a virtuous but finite man in whose life god was dynamically present in a unique way christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified holy spirit an impersonal attribute of the godhead no deity or eternality is ascribed to the holy spirit criticism s elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the trinity categorically denies the deity of christ and of the holy spirit thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation in summary this probably best thought of as not being trinitarianism at all god is an undifferentiated one son and holy spirit are seen as simply names for the man jesus and the grace of god active in the church -- clh modalistic monarchianism source praxeas adherents noatus sabellius swedenborg scleiermacher united pentecostals jesus only perception of god 's essence the unity of god is ultra-simplex he is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person this essence may be designated interchangeably as father son and holy spirit they are different names for but identical with the unified simplex god the three names are the three modes by which god reveals himself perception of god 's subsistence the concept of a subsistent god is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of god 's modalistic manifesting of himself the paradox of a subsisting `` three in oneness '' is refuted by recognizing that god is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama asignation of deity/eternality father fully god and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary god son full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one god and identical with his essence he is the same god manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role incarnation holy spirit eternal god only as the tile designates the phase in which the one god in temporal sequence manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification criticism s depersonalizes the godhead to compensate for its trinitarian deficiencies this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical its concept of successive manifestations of the godhead can not account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at christ 's baptism rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy there are actually two slightly different groups included noetus and his followers and sabellius noetus was apparently more extreme sabellius followed him and attempted to use some features of economic trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view unfortunately information about sabellius comes from a century later and there seems to be some confusion

subsistence subsistence within the godhead is articulated by means of such terms as `` distinction '' and `` distribution '' dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division asignation of deity/eternality the equal deity of father son and holy spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the godhead co-eternality at times does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view but it seems to be a logical implication criticism s is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the trinity note that this is a development of the apologists and irenaeus as mentioned above as with them the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that god revealed himself in history however they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the godhead from the beginning tertullian talks of the father son and holy spirit as being three that are one in substance many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox but with less developed philosophical categories -- clh origen developing further an approach started by clement attempted to apply neo-platonism to christian thought he set many of the terms of the coming battle in platonic fashion he sees the son as a mediator mediating between the absolute one of god and the plurality of creating beings the son is generated but he is `` eternally generated '' that is the relationship between father and son is eternal it can not be said that `` there was once when he was not '' a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries having the son is intrinsic to his concept of god the father and son are described as separate `` hypostases '' though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts the union is one of love and action but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios `` of the same substance '' the holy spirit is also an active personal substance originated by the father through the son origen 's intent is trinitarian not tritheistic but he pushes things in the direction of separateness fourth century -- clh subordinationism often called arianism -- clh source arius major adherents modern jehovah 's witnesses and several other lesser known cults perception of god 's essence the inherent oneness of god 's nature is properly identifiable with the father only the son and the holy spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence perception of god 's subsistence the unipersonal essence of god precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a godhead `` threeness in oneness '' is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic god asignation of deity/eternality father the only one unbegotten god who is eternal and without beginning son a created being and therefore not eternal though he is to be venerated he is not of the divine essence holy spirit a nonpersonal noneternal emanation of the father he is viewed as an influence an expression of god deity is not ascribed to him criticism s it is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both christ and the holy spirit its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the father christ and the holy spirit this results in a totally confused soteriology note also that in most versions of this view the son is not fully human either he is supernatural and sinless that distinguishes this view from adoptionism -- clh orthodox trinitarianism source athanasius adherents basil gregory of nyssa gregory of nazianzus augustine thomas aquinas luther calvin contemporary orthodox christianity perception of god 's essence god 's being is perfectly unified and simplex of one essence this essence of deity is held in common by father son and holy spirit the three persons are consubstantial coinherent co-equal and co- eternal perception of god 's subsistence the divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases as such the godhead exists `` undivided in divided persons '' this view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the godhead asignation of deity/eternality in its final distillation this view unhesitatingly sets forth father son and holy spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function criticism s the only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of `` three in oneness '' at least in the 4th cent there were several different approaches all of which fit the description here and all regarded as orthodox but which are somewhat different in detail nicea was originally held to respond to arius arius can be thought of as carrying origen 's thought a bit too far to the point of making the son a separate entity in general the east tended to take an approach based on origen 's and it was hard to get acceptance of nicea in the east its final acceptance was based on the work of athanasius with the cappadocians gregory of nyssa and gregory of nazianzus among others while starting with three they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single god this allowed the council of constantinople in to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia --

16, document_id from kilroy gboro.rowan.edu dr nancy 's sweetie subject re certainty and arrogance in an earlier article i explained that what many people find arrogant about christians is that some christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines that is many christians insist that they can not have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs which amounts to saying that they are infallible impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant most of us will probably agree in short the problem is that no matter how good your sources are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect so long as your own brain is involved there is a possibility for error i summarised the problem by writing `` there is no way out of the loop '' someone called rexlex has claimed that there is a way out of the loop but he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase sartre ramble about wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism as i have explained to him before you can not reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads the facts do not change just because you dislike them rexlex wrote i disagree with dr nancy 's sweetie 's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair however as any first-year philosophy student can explain what rexlex has written does not constitute a refutation all he has said is that he does not like what i wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it there were two sentences in rexlex 's post that seemed relevant to the point at hand there is such a thing as true truth and it is real it can be experienced and it is verifiable i do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience i have for example direct experience of adding numbers i do n't claim to be infallible at it -- in fact i remember doing sums incorrectly -- but i do claim that i have direct experience of reasoning about numbers however once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them we are on much shakier ground that was the point of the earlier article human brains are infested with sin and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances it is only because of god 's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing but how far does that get you once god 's revelation stops and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears for example let 's suppose that our modern bible translations include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper and that jesus said exactly `` this is my body '' we 'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true what can we be certain of not much at the moment he stops speaking and people start interpreting the possibility of error appears did he mean that literally or not we do not have any record that he elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran- or con- substatiation he did n't say we interpret this passage using our brains we think and reason and draw conclusions but we know that our brains are not perfect our thinking often leads us wrong this is something that most of us have direct experience of 8- why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions so given the assumptions in this example what we can be certain of is that jesus said `` this is my body '' beyond that once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what christ revealed we get into trouble unless you are infallible there are very few things you can be certain of to the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking they can not be certain that is the problem of seeming arrogant the non-christians around us know that human beings make mistakes just as surely as we know it they do not believe we are infallible any more than we do when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying to cover them up i think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only `` very confident '' of for example we might say that we know our sin for recognising sin is something we directly experience but other things whether based on reasoning from scripture or extra-biblical thinking should not be labled as infallible we should say that we are very confident of them and be ready to explain our reasoning but so far as i am aware none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous rexlex suggested that people read _he is there and he is not silent_ by francis schaeffer i did n't think very highly of it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many evangelical christians somebody else might like it though so do n't let my opinion stop you from reading it if someone is interested in my opinion i 'd suggest _on certainty_ by ludwig wittgenstein darren f provine kilroy gboro.rowan.edu '' if any substantial number of

if they understood some wittgenstein would disappear '' -- michael l siemon notice what i said about this book i called it `` easy reading '' the reason i dropped philosphy as my major was because i ran into too many pharisaical simon 's i do n't know how many walking encyclopedia 's i ran across in philosphy classes the problem is n't in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person the problem comes when you become puffed up about it schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person that was who he was writting to i suppose that you would have criticised john that his gospel was to simple i 've talked with schaeffer one on one i 've been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof 's from secular as well as christian universities nd alone would fill both those catagories his answers were enough that the prof 's themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was i saw this time and time again at different open forums so yes schaeffers books are by in large well simplistic it certainly is n't grad level reading but we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of wittgenstein i may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time also one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by insistent inquisitiveness one can not live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base look the christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality but we must add a qualification to give this balance christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place we never know the value of a thing until we know its limits put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value this is why xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic it also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism and not christian faith which leads to irrationality if we forget the limits of a thing we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life '' more without limits is less less with limits is more '' or as i have so often stated it freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom let 's put it another way the rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery think about that it can tell the difference between the two if you will let it christianity 's contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it but that it has very little else when a christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding this is where the principle of suspended judgment applies at such time if the christian faith is to be itself and let god be god it must suspend judgment and say `` father i do not understand you but i trust you '' now do n't read all your objections of me into that statement i was n't saying i do not understand you at all but i trust you anyway '' it means that `` i do not understand you in this situation but i do understand why i trust you anyway '' therefore i can trust that you understand even though i do not the former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity the latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of faith so .... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational it is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith as believers we can not always know why but we canalways know why we trust god who knows why and this makes all the difference now there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where i have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice in practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent `` whying '' of a year old it is n't just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we must know what we can not know the one produces frustration because curiosity is denied the other leads to genuine anguish more specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith if we do not know why we trust god then we will always need to know exactly what god is doing in order to trust him failing to grasp that we may not be able to trust him for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust if on the other hand we do know why we trust god we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what he is doing too many xian leaders teach as if the christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall for what god is doing may be ambiguous but it will not be inherently contradictory it may be mystery to

apr.29.04.19.17.1993.9069 geneva.rutgers.edu sun075 gerry.palo uunet.uu.net gerry palo writes note that in this perhaps the oldest of the creeds there is no mention of the danger of hell for non-believers likewise there is no mention of the salvation of the believers soul and its destiny in heaven after death there is only the resurrection of the body and it does not say when or how you do n't go far enough back if we believe in god and that he did create the heavens and the earth and he did create adam and eve and that they walked in the garden and history flowed from there if we can agree with that then would you agree that the further back you go the closer you get to people who had a stronger memory of who god was and what he said and commanded between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred this involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world this is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history the greek for example could say `` better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead '' iliad i think the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is an ever present one with christians i am not ready to conscign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation yet they all died in their sins in the christian sense the same can be said of the whole of gentile humanity and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him i do not limit the power of christ to save even him through whom satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment in my studies of the ancient mystery reliegions i have run across many poems or rituals or what nots with the interpretation that those who are of god will be with him via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer eternal life in dieing it was a standard belief back then it is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment the relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of greenwich mean time it is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss or even many of them in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth it was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost this again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people 's ideas of life after death today we think we know so much and that if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two but i think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a mist not those of the older ages mankind fell into mist and darkness and at `` the turning point of time '' a new light entered into the world the light still grows and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us our new vision and understanding is still very feeble but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well at this point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insights that have led me to my views on this subject i have said it before i 'd love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would fall the history to purgatory can be shown from the druids in england to the greeks who pilaged it from the egyptians who ultimately got it from the babylonian mysteries and yes the eastern religions also show many similarities i mean its black and white the writings and the archeological finds plainly show its origin and the whys and wherefores of this doctine the way you refer to it as `` doctrine '' puts a modern intellectual coloring on it i think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received i am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they were passed on the question is to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people 's ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality in any case we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of euclid but by contemplating the principles themselves on the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is created at birth was consciously adopted from aristotle whose ideas dominated christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today he was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim maybe at sometime in the future- indeed i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment i.e after the end of a single earthly life is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality and i think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out rex gerry 73237.2006

16," document_id from wagner grace.math.uh.edu david wagner subject re certainty and arrogance '' darren '' == dr nancy 's sweetie kilroy gboro.rowan.edu writes darren in an earlier article i explained that what many people find darren arrogant about christians is that some christians profess darren absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines and darren in short the problem is that no matter how good your sources darren are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own darren thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect the point that darren raises is a very lutheran viewpoint while reason is a gift from god it is also infected by sin yet we do not reject reason entirely -- and neither i think does darren we need reason as darren himself has pointed out to comprehend god 's revelation of himself in the bible but reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the word we need first and foremost faith for `` the sinful mind is hostile to god it does not submit to god 's law nor can it do so '' romans 8:7 luther accepted scripture as the sole means of revelation `` sola scriptura '' but accepted the necessity of the use of reason with faith in comprehending that revelation yet luther also said regarding baptism `` but mad reason rushes forth and because baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do regards it as worthless '' large catechism fourth part baptism to make matters more complicated luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an absolutist i 've seen him described as a take no prisoners theologian we might conclude given these observations that luther was inconsistent or mad and surely at least some have come to that conclusion but it might be useful to recall that jesus was also called mad and peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on pentecost so we as christians ought to be careful about rejecting luther or others as mad rather we should imitate the bereans who examined the scriptures every day to see if what paul said was true acts 17:11 the basis for the confidence with which luther peter paul and many others preached the gospel was not just reason but faith and the holy spirit this is not faith divorced from reason but a faith that guides informs and uses reason the spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly god does not want us to preach the message that `` i think that jesus might have risen from the dead '' but rather `` i know that my redeemer lives '' job 19:25 the christian does not side with pilate in saying `` what is truth '' but rather follows christ who said `` in fact for this reason i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth everyone on the side of truth listens to me '' john 18:37 we can know the truth because god has promised us that we can know the truth jesus said `` if you hold to my teachings you are really my disciples then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free '' john 8:31,32 the proverbs urge us `` buy the truth and do not sell it '' pr 23:23 the psalmist prayed `` do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth '' ps 119:43 evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact in his mouth yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification but if we present the truth as the teachings of scripture revealed by the spirit and not our own invention and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of scripture as luther did then we are not arrogant but humble we should humbly trust in god 's promise of truth just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness rexlex it is only because of god 's own revelation that we can be rexlex absolute about a thing darren but how far does that get you once god 's revelation stops darren and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears i agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of scripture and the products of our own reason -- even when such reasoning is based on scripture however i think i would draw the line of distinction more reasonably and less academically' than you would darren for example let 's suppose that our modern bible translations darren include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper darren and that jesus said exactly `` this is my body '' darren we 'll presume that what he said was totally without error and darren absolutely true what can we be certain of not much darren at the moment he stops speaking and people start darren interpreting the possibility of error appears did he mean darren that literally or not we do not have any record that he darren elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran- or con- darren substantiation he did n't say darren is almost at the point of making a very lutheran statement about the lord 's supper the lutheran approach is to say that if jesus said `` this is my body '' then that is what we should believe other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in scripture recall that jesus words do not stand alone on this subject we also have paul 's words in corinthians 11:17-34 -- in which he passed on to us what he received from the lord in particular he said `` for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the lord 's death until he comes '' by these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the lord 's supper really is bread as well as the lord 's body -- as our senses in fact tell us does this prove that tran-substantiation is false i suppose someone could say that paul spoke metaphorically of the lord 's body as bread simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it but this thought is found nowhere in scripture so we reject it thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false but that it is simply not found in scripture side remark i 've been told that the lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation but it has been non-lutherans who have told me this we tend not to use the word i almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion who need labels to compare catholic lutheran and reformed teachings on the lord's supper but almost every church wants to call their own teaching '' real presence '' because that was the traditional teaching of the church end side remark darren when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning darren can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we darren are infallible -- the non- christians around us rarely believe darren that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work when darren the person you are talking to believes that you are either too darren foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying darren to cover them up this is precisely why christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing it is far better to take the approach '' i 'd like to show you what scripture says you decide for yourself whether to believe it or not '' darren rexlex suggested that people read _he is there and he is not darren silent_ by francis schaeffer i did n't think very highly of darren it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many darren evangelical christians somebody else might like it though darren so do n't let my opinion stop you from reading it darren if someone is interested in my opinion i 'd suggest _on darren certainty_ by ludwig wittgenstein as long as we 're trading references i 'd like to suggest dr. siegbert becker 's paperback `` the foolishness of god the place of reason in lutheran theology '' published by northwestern publishing house this book

do right ... or are they just lucky maybe they 're just unlucky if a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in boston chances are almost certain that she wo n't be counted as one of those self-defenders

this means the 'average threat level in this country is rather low ironic words for somebody who lives in florida the `` average threat level '' in florida has been reduced by a liberal ccw policy it

diddlysquat the '' average threat level in the country '' means to a resident there i think you have weapons on the brain i never said that these alternative means of self-protection involved any hardware why are 'good neighborhoods 'good it is n't because every person is armed to the teeth it is because of attitude and cooperation in the 'good neighborhoods the residents make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when strangers are lurking around 'good neighborhoods form groups like 'crime-watch to increase this effect and the relative effectiveness of the police when hostiles are arrested the good neighbors step up and say `` that 's the one officer he was robbing mr. jones house '' sometimes this works sometimes it just lands your good neighbors on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys someone here once told a story about la gangs moving into phoenix i 've misplaced the original text but the story started with one resident calling the cops on a gang member sure enough a few nights later there was a drive-by performed at the resident 's house except that this time unlike in la the entire street came out and returned fire putting an end to the car 's occupants the gang packed up and left of course in la or in a place like florida after the hurricane your first problem is to find an officer to step up to and tell anything in short the alternative to

progress on an ironic note where i deleted lines emacs continually gave me the message `` garbage collecting ... done '' think it 's trying to tell me something viking iastate.edu dan sorenson writes and thank you it 's a great change from the same tired old debates ... you lurkers can join in at any time you know ahhh .. talk.politics.guns -- the kindler gentler newsgroup who would have thought no not exactly the only reason for this sort of restriction is the possible endangerment of others a poorly maintained rifle is dangerous but only to the user since it doesn't endanger others there is no justification for such restrictions i remind you of shrapnel i consider a reasonable space limitation but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby say in the next lane at the range my point was at what distance or level of threat we draw the line is it the endangerment of others so we do a restriction or the possibility of being shot hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction or a nuke and draw a mile restriction to me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user perhaps sen. metzenbaum declaring the barrett light fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me since the barrett has only range and acurracy going for it they have determined that their lives are worth the effort to protect their homes and families using nuclear weapons close to home will not accomplish this i disagree on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once i have died i assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned if this is not the case the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit personally my home is worth say twenty martians intent on taking over the world my family all of them the balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk there is however another problem in any case of civil war the strength of the militias fighting on each side should reflect the popular will if the public is split versus then the minorities militias should be at a 2:1 disadvantage such a need for popular support would hopefully prevent insurrections unless the people really were behind the rebels but heavy weapons owned by a small fraction of the militia could distort this what if the minority included all the tank and artillery owners that seems to be the case already given that heavy weapons are n't commonly owned by the citizenry with such low numbers obviously due to cost i do n't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe furthermore it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness i think it is vital to avoid such a situation where a small minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power through violence to prevent this it may be necessary to give control of heavy weapons e.g those which only a small number of individuals would own _and_ whose firepower would grossly distort the relation between popular support and military strength to someone other that individual militiamen this is certainly not a good thing but i think it is the lesser of two evils whoever controls these weapons must be a democratic body responsive to the will of the people i had envisioned that the armorer perhaps the officers of a select group and the like would exercise control over the heavier more complex weapons but if joe bob owns an old sherman tank i certainly would n't ask him to give it up follow orders from the officers yes since the expense of a tank is so large though chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated here i think we have to be carefull about _which_ `` state '' we are talking about certainly one role of the militia is to overthrow a repressive government and it would be completely destructive to that end for that same government to control the militia 's arms but the united states have several levels of government each able to act independently but not all likely targets of rebelion as such rebelions against state and local governments are very unlikely i think therefore that the state or possibly local governments could safely be allowed to keep the select militia 's heavy weapons the risk of abuse while still something to consider is far less than the similar risk were the federal government in control this i 'll agree with to a point the state having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located keep them spread out such that the ability of the state to lock them up is n't so easy otherwise i would have to assume that state control would rest on the authority of the governor and militia officers that is eaxctly why i think they should be removed the select militia should privide the militia 's heavy weapons and highly-trained specialists for the reasons i have outlines above i think these heavy weapons tanks artillery aircraft etc ... are better off being kept by local governments than by a small number of individuals however local governments shouldn't be able to use the select militia without the support to the people ideally the general militia under the direct control of the people and the select militia under the direction of democratic local governments would opperate together but even in the worst case the general militia should be able to functional without the select militia similarly the select militia should be incapable of action without the aid of the general militia i 'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons fairly few in numbers could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side does n't have all of them i ca n't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry i think a better mix is called for but i would argue that the federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units consider then the effect of removing the national guard's infantry and placing the guard under the control of local governments the government-controled select militia could not fight effectively without infantry support provided by the general militia an inherently infantry organization on the other hand the general militia could function although at a disadvantage without the backing of local governments and the select militia we have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces and if they 've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble i 'd like to see that heavy stuff say tanks offset by the local troups having a few 's and anti-tank weapons in their armory these would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in i suppose i 'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment ... but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds dikes in times of flood sets up disaster relief cities and the like i would much rather see these things handled by the local general militias so would i but the resources often are n't available to outfit local units well enough thus we will certainly have to call in others and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else perhaps the national guard is n't as close to my conception of the select militia as i thought i was considering them to be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia not the infantry arm of the regular army perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different i think main battle tanks self-propelled artillery and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff m113 troop carriers 1/2 ton trucks humvee 's old m60 tanks howitzers are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry actually this is what the guard units in iowa are currently fielding in some units perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under state control with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks similarly local units would need to band together quickly hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry finally the militia is more than just fighting equipment is needed for other responses the federal army i 'm convinced should have a very minumum of infantry relying on the state and local militias for these functions dan sorenson dod z1dan exnet.iastate.edu viking iastate.edu isu only censors what i read not what i

17, document_id from ndallen r-node.hub.org nigel allen subject waco clinton press conference part here is a press release from the white house president clinton 's remarks on waco with q/a to national desk contact white house office of the press secretary 202-456-2100 washington april -- following are remarks by president clinton in a question and answer session with the press 1:36 p.m. edt the president on february the 28th four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective a 51-day standoff ensued the federal bureau of investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life the bureau 's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing david koresh was dangerous irrational and probably insane he engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency he was moreover responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in february given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi designed to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it was hoped force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender i was informed of the plan to end the siege i discussed it with attorney general reno i asked the questions i thought it was appropriate for me to ask i then told her to do what she thought was right and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday 's action ended in a horrible human tragedy mr. koresh 's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive he killed those he controlled and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued now we must review the past with an eye towards the future i have directed the united stated departments of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why and whether anything could have been dne differently i have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation i expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review finally i have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances again i want to say as i did yesterday i am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in waco i hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks and i hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now q mr. president can you first of all tell us why after days you decided -- q mr. president can you describe for us what it is that janet reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- the president i ca n't hear you both if one will go first and then the other q sorry can you describe what janet reno -- q mr. president -- the president i 'll answer both your questions but i ca n't do it at once q can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it the president yes i was told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound and she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building and it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside i was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon they were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire in fact as you know an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials there were no shots coming back from the government side i asked a number of questions the first question i asked is why now we have waited seven weeks why now the reasons i was given were the following number one that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there they might be needed in other parts of the country number two that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult members to come out number three that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time and number four that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions so for those reasons they wanted to move at that time the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good she said that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time the third question i asked was has the military been consulted as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco that 's the first thing i asked to be done because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation military people were then brought in helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it and so i asked if the military had been consulted the attorney general said that they had and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance having asked those questions and gotten those answers i said that if she thought it was the right thing to do that she should proceed and that i would support it and i stand by that today q mr. president -- the president wait go ahead q can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely television radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster the president no i 'm bewildered by it the only reason i made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold there was -- i have -- i ca n't account for why people speculated one way or the other but i talked to the attorney general on the day before the action took place i talked to her yesterday i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry king show and i talked to her again this morning a president -- it is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control i will say this however i was frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves applause i regret what happened but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance these people killed four federal officials in the line of duty they were heavily armed they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly and they were never fired back on we did everything we could to avoid the loss of life they made the decision to immolate themselves and i regret it terribly and i feel awful about the children but in the end the last comment i had from janet reno is when -- and i talked to her on sunday -- i said now i want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she said it 's because of the children they have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they 're in increasingly unsafe conditions and that they do n't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time i have to take their word for that so that is where i think things stand q can we assume then that you do n't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome that you did n't run out of patience and if you had it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no -- well i think what you can assume is just exactly what i announced today this is a -- the fbi has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety-split record time we want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way is there something else we should have known is there some other question they should have asked is there some other question i should have asked can i say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different i do n't know that that 's why i want the inquiry and that 's why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non-political outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have there is unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world and we may have to confront it again and i want to know whether there is anything we can do particularly when there are children involved but i do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves q mr. president were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from february 28th until yesterday the president well yes i got regular reports all along the way there were lots of other options pursued if you go back -- you all covered it very well the fbi -- you did a very good job of it i mean the fbi and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way and a lot of them early on seemed to be working some of the children got out some of the other people left there was a -- at one point there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the authorities and then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday the conversation i had with the attorney general did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves that 's what they thought q did the government know that the children did not have gas masks q congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that the president that 's up to the congress they can do whatever they want but i think it 's very important that the treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts and as i said in my statement if any congressional committees want to look into it we will fully cooperate there is nothing to hide here this was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country more

january |3| macedonian human rights activists to face trial in greece two ethnic macedonian human rights activists will face trial in athens for alleged crimes against the greek state according to a court summons no obtained by mils hristos sideropoulos and tashko bulev or anastasios bulis have been charged under greek criminal law for making comments in an athenian magazine sideropoulos and bulev gave an interview to the greek weekly magazine `` ena '' on march and said that they as macedonians were denied basic human rights in greece and would field an ethnic macedonian candidate for the up-coming greek general election bulev said in the interview `` i am not greek i am macedonian '' sideropoulos said in the article that `` greece should recognise macedonia the allegations regarding territorial aspirations against greece are tales ... we are in a panic to secure the border at a time when the borders and barriers within the eec are falling '' the main charge against the two according to the court summons was that `` they have spread ... intentionally false information which might create unrest and fear among the citizens and might affect the public security or harm the international interests of the country greece '' the greek state does not recognise the existence of a macedonian ethnicity there are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000 ethnic macedonians living within greece largely concentrated in the north it is a crime against the greek state if anyone declares themselves macedonian in greece serbia-yugoslavia and bulgaria partioned macedonia into three pieces in albania took macedonian villages the part under serbo-yugoslav occupation broke away in as the independent republic of macedonia there are 1.5 million macedonians in the republic 500,000 in bulgaria 150,000 in albania and 300,000 in serbia proper sideropoulos has been a long time campaigner for macedonian human rights in greece and lost his job as a forestry worker a few years ago he was even exiled to an obscure greek island in the mediteranean only pressure from amnesty international forced the greek government to allow him to return to his home town of florina lerin in northern greece aegean macedonia where the majority of ethnic macedonians live balkan watchers see the sideropoulos affair as a show trial in which greece is desperate to clamp down on internal dissent especially when it comes to the issue of recognition for its northern neighbour the republic of macedonia last year the state department of the united states condemned greece for its bad treatment of ethnic macedonians and turks who largely live in western thrace but it remains to be seen if the us government will do anything until the presidential elections are over serdar argic 'we

18, document_id from zbib bnr.ca sam zbib subject legality of the jewish purchase was re israeli expansion-lust adam shostack writes sam zbib writes i 'm surprised that you do n't consider the acquisition of land by the jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state as a hostile action leading to war it was for the purpose of establishing a state not an exclusive state if the state was to be exclusive it would not have arab citizens could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of israel right after it was formed and no i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action when someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce it is not a hostile action leading to war no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity palestinians are no exception perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions basic anti-trust law says that while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of investing you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling ibm you can do so only if you make your intentions clear apriori clearly the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality being a multi-ethnic multi-religious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another religion plus they paid fair market value etc ... they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy i 'm not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one is hard to dismiss as to whether the jews wanted to live in peace maybe however they wanted and still want an exclusively jewish state where jews are in control and jews are the masters of the land living in peace is meaningless unless it means living with someone else as equal for a native arab this does not leave many options oh you mean like both jews and arabs being citizens the arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who they vote for as the jews again adam the devil is in the details i do n't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its ok to return deportes and leave the rest because is a nice number that you can devide by and besides it has an integer square root those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless and ineffective minority if i were wrong you 'd have israel recall all the palestinian refugees we 're talking millions after all they are civilians huh the people who left did so voluntarily there is no reason for israel to let them in do you actually believe this my experience tells me that every palestinian i knew still keeps the key to his home in palestine besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell so to speak i know none that agrees with you did you sample their opinions i know you do n't care just being rethorical israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing israel got no western aid in nor in or ... it still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained and how is granting citizenship a facade do n't get me wrong i beleive that israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group jews israel probably had a few options after ethnic cleansing serbian style and deserve the wrath of the international community or make the best out of a no win condition show the world how good israel is towards the 'bad arabs personaly i 've never heard anything about the arab community in isreal except that they 're there so yes they 're there but as a community with history and roots its dead tell me something sam what makes land `` arab '' how shall i explain its a contract between the man and the land control is n't it the ottomans ruled years and then left with barely a trace the concept of land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic west it is partly the concept of 'le sol natal native soil i know that jews had previous history in the region but none in recent memory i 'm talking everyday life not archeology try again you tell me what its is n't but you fail to establish what it is also jews did have history in israel for over a thousand years there were lots of jews slaughtered by crusaders in israel there was a thriving community in gaza city from roughly 1200-1500 jews were a majority in jerusalem from or so onwards does that make the land jewish i stand corrected i meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in palestine in recent history i have no problem with jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly jewish so there what to make of the rest palestine adam shostack adam das.harvard.edu -- sam zbib bell-northern research -- -- -- --

nearly years of espionage by a man who infiltrated political groups by richard c. paddock times staff writer san francisco -- to the outside world roy bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the castro district in reality he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the anti-defamation league for nearly years his code name at the prominent jewish organization was cal and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an arab-american delegation that visited rep. nancy pelosi d-san francisco in her washington d.c. office for a time cal tapped into the phone message system of the white aryan resistance to learn of hate crimes from police sources he obtained privileged personal information on at least 1,394 people and he met surreptitiously with agents of the south african government to trade his knowledge for crisp new bills these are among the secrets that bullock and david gurvitz a former los angeles-based operative divulged in extensive interviews with police and the fbi in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the anti-defamation league officials of the anti-defamation league while denying any improper activity have said they will cooperate with the investigation they have refused to discuss bullock and gurvitz transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly pages of documents released by san francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory at times the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments shredded documents hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like `` ironsides '' and `` flipper '' on one occasion gurvitz recounts he received a tip that a pro-palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for haifa israel although the anti-defamation league publicly denies any ties to israel gurvitz phoned an israeli consular official to warn him shortly afterward another official called gurvitz back and debriefed him the court papers also added to the mystery of tom gerard a former cia agent and san francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the anti-defamation league gerard fled to the philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the fbi but left behind a briefcase in his police locker its contents included passports driver 's licenses and identification cards in different names identification cards in his own name for four american embassies in central america and a collection of blank birth certificates army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads a black hood apparently for use in interrogations and photos of blindfolded and chained men investigators suspect that gerard and other police sources gave the adl confidential driver 's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people including as many as 4,500 members of one target group the arab-american anti-discrimination committee each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony san francisco police inspector ron roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant the anti-defamation league a self-described jewish defense and civil rights organization acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-semitic extremist or racist the adl's fact-finding division headed by irwinn suall in new york enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists however evidence seized from bullock 's computer shows he kept files on at least groups of all political stripes including the american civil liberties union earth island institute the united farm workers jews for jesus mother jones magazine the center for investigative reporting the bo gritz for president committee the asian law caucus and the aids activist group act up the computer files also included information on several members of congress including pelosi house armed services committee chairman ron dellums d-berkeley and former republican rep. pete mccloskey from the bay area in their statements bullock and gurvitz said the anti-defamation league has collected information on political activists in the los angeles area for more than years they said they worked closely with three los angeles county sheriff 's deputies who specialized in intelligence work a los angeles police department anti-terrorism expert and a san diego county sheriff 's department intelligence officer a spokesman for the los angeles sheriff 's department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the adl the los angeles police department which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation and the san diego sheriff 's department declined comment bullock is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama although he is not jewish he began working undercover as a volunteer for the adl and the fbi in indiana in after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the communist party bullock moved to los angeles in and was given a paid position by the adl as an intelligence operative he told authorities in the mid-1970s he moved to san francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the west coast to keep his identity secret his salary has always been funneled through beverly hills attorney bruce i. hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than years bullock said `` i was an investigator for the adl i investigated any and all anti-democratic movements '' bullock said `` officially i 'm only a contract worker with bruce hochman that way the league would not be officially connected with me '' bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from communists to arab-american to gay radicals to skinheads usually using his own name but once adopting the alias elmer fink `` i 'm one of a kind '' he told police in recent years however his adl affiliation has increasingly become known and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him in the mid-1980s he helped san francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist cory phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police in part because of this investigation he became close friends with gerard who at the time was working in the san francisco police intelligence division bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups an fbi report noted how he investigated one palestinian group '' bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash and would share the reports with gerard bullock also gave the trash to gerard for gerard to examine gerard would later return the trash to bullock '' from a wide range of sources bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than political groups gerard whose files contained many identical entries kept files on 7,011 people in bullock and gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the south african government bullock tells of meetings secretly with south african agents at san francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new bills bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources once he rewrote an innocuous item published by san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen about south african bishop desmond tutu and the wife of prominent attorney melvin belli -- and submitted it as his own work bullock said it was gerard who sold official police intelligence bullock said he split about 16,000 from the south african government evenly with gerard telling him at one point `` i may be gay but i 'm a straight arrow '' in his interviews with the police and fbi bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law for example bullock admitted to receiving driver 's license records and criminal histories from gerard on about people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer and he said gerard gave him complete san francisco police department intelligence files on various nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy bullock said he also received a confidential fbi report on the nation of islam that he later shredded at the anti-defamation league 's san francisco office bullock seemed proud of his `` operation eavesdrop '' in which he used a paid informant code-named scumbag to help tap into a white aryan resistance phone message network listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group `` for a short time it was wonderful '' he told police in los angeles adl operative gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a `` fact-finder '' to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups among other things he told san francisco authorities the los angeles adl office kept a record of any arab-american who had `` anti-israel leanings '' or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the adl intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job gurvitz wanted at the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust studies gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a jewish spy to a right-wing hate group gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the fbi in the probe providing considerable information about the adl operation unlike bullock he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation gurvitz declined through his

peter van der linden writes so did the turks kill the armenians so did the jews kill the germans you even make armenians laugh `` an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic the memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the u.s. in with the title 'men are like that other references abound '' rachel a. bortnick the jewish times june or was it the armenians who massacred the turks yes to be exact armenians slaughtered 2.5 million muslim people between and source mccarthy j. `` muslims and minorities the population of ottoman

increased the area of transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles the estimated population of the entire region in was 4,700,000 of whom 940,000 percent were armenian 1,200,000 percent georgian and 2,220,000 percent moslem of the latter group 1,140,000 were tatars paradoxically barely one-third of transcaucasia 's armenians lived in the erevan guberniia where the christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only 44,000 armenians as compared to 68,000 moslems by the time of the russian census of however the armenians had established a scant majority percent in the guberniia it had risen by to percent or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants this impressive change in the province 's ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the armenian republic a solid block of 370,000 tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia '' see also map historic armenia and map administrative subdivisions of transcaucasia in percent turk `` we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination our troops surrounded village after village little resistance was offered our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work some of the tartars escaped of course they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey the rest were killed and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over

thinking about the price the sumgait armenians paid to be living in armenia now we paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates -- the price was too great now after the sumgait tragedy we the victims divide our lives into `` before '' and `` after '' we talk like that that was before the war like the people who went through world war ii and considered it a whole epoch a fate no matter how many years go by no matter how long we live it will never be forgotten on the contrary some of the moments become even sharper in our rage in our sorrow we saw everything differently but now they say that you can see more with distance and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every sumgait armenian those who lost someone and those who did n't that second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family although you could already smell danger in the air but we did n't think that the danger was near and possible so we did n't take any steps to save ourselves at least as my parents say at least we should have done something to save the children my parents themselves are not that old and years but then they thought that they had already lived enough and did everything they could to save us in our apartment the tragedy started on february around five in the afternoon i call it a tragedy and i repeat it was a tragedy even though all our family survived when i recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls even now among armenians among people who wish me only well i feel like it 's all starting over again i remember how that mob broke into our apartment my parents were standing in the hall my father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by we 're known as a hospitable family and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were azerbaijanis jews or russians we had friends of many nationalities even a turkmen woman my parents were in the hall my father with an axe i remember him telling my mother `` run to the kitchen for a knife '' but mother was detached pale as though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer to be honest i never expected it of her she 's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark a girlfriend was at the house that day a russian girl lyuda and mamma said '' no matter what happens no matter what they do to us you 're not to come out of the bedroom we 're going to tell them that we 're alone in the apartment '' we went into the bedroom there were four of us marina and the russian girl crawled under the bed and we covered them up with a rug boxes of dishes and karina and i are standing there and looking at one another the idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside me i 'm an emotional person and i express my emotions immediately i wanted to embrace her and kiss her as though it were the last second and maybe karina was thinking the same thing but she 's quite reserved we did n't have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard mamma raise a shout there was so much noise from the tramping of feet from the shouting and from excited voices i could n't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack but when mamma shouted the second time karina ran out of the bedroom i ran after her i had wanted to hold her back but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us immediately the only thing i managed to do was close the door behind me at least so as to save marina and her friend the mob was shouting all of their eyes were shining all red like from insomnia at first about people burst in but later i was standing with my back to the door and could n't see they came into the hall into the kitchen and dragged my father into the other room he did n't utter a word he just raised the axe to hit them but mamma snatched the axe from behind and said `` tell them not to touch the children tell them they can do as they want with us but not to harm the children '' she said this to father in armenian there were azerbaijanis from armenia among the mob who broke in they understood armenian perfectly the local azerbaijanis do n't know armenian they do n't need to speak it and one of them responded in armenian `` you and your children both we 're going to do the same thing to you and your children that you armenians did in kafan they killed our women our girls our mothers they cut their breasts off and burned our houses '' and so on and so forth `` and we came to do the same thing to you '' this whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us they were mostly young people under at first there were n't any older people among them and all of their faces were unfamiliar sumgait is a small town all the same and we know a lot of people by their faces especially me i 'm a teacher so they dragged my father into the other room they twisted his arms and took him in there no they did n't take him in there they dragged him in there because he was already unable to walk they closed the door to that room all but a crack we could n't see what was happening to father what they were doing to him then a young man about years old started to tear off mamma 's sarafan and mamma shouted at him in azerbaijani `` i 'm old enough to be your mother what are you doing '' he struck her now he 's being held mamma identified him i hope he 's convicted then they went after karina who 's been talking to them like a komsomol leader as though she were trying to lead them down a different path as they say to influence their consciousness she told them that what they were doing was wrong that they must n't do it she said `` come on let 's straighten this out without emotions what do you want who are you why did you come here what did we ever do to you '' someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home but then the ones in the back -- more of them kept coming and coming -- said `` what are you talking to them for you should kill them we came here to kill them '' they pushed karina struck her and she fell down they beat her but she did n't cry out even when they tore her clothes off she kept repeating `` what did we do to you what did we do to you '' and even later when she came to she said `` mamma what did we do to them why did they do that to us '' that group was prepared i know this because i noticed that some of them only broke up furniture and others only dealt with us i remember that when they were beating me when they were tearing my clothes off i felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to karina all i could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her and what they did to her that 's why i felt no pain later when they carried karina off they beat her savagely it 's really amazing that she not only lived but did n't lose her mind she is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her beauty mostly they beat her face with their fists kicking her using anything they could find mamma karina and i were all in one room and again i did n't feel any pain just did n't feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they did then one of those creeps said that there was n't enough room in the apartment they broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more room then someone suggested `` let 's take her outside '' those beasts were in heaven they did what they would do every day if they were n't afraid of the authorities those were their true colors at the time i thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they were n't afraid of what would happen to them when they carried karina out and beat mamma-her face was completely covered with blood -- that 's when i started to feel the pain i blacked out several times from the pain but each moment that i had my eyes open it was as though i were recording it all on film i think i 'm a kind person by nature but i 'm vengeful especially if someone is mean to me and i do n't deserve it i hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain and every time i would come to and see one of those animals on top of me i 'd remember them and i 'll remember them for the rest of my life even though people tell me '' forget '' you have to forget you have to go on living at some point i remember that they stood me up and told me something and despite the fact that i hurt all over -- i had been beaten terribly -- i found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures i realized that i had to do something resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an end i pushed one of them away he was a real horse i remember now that he 's being held too as though they were all waiting for it they seized me and took me out onto the balcony i had long hair and it was stuck all over me one of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open and i realized that they planned to throw me out the window because they had already picked me up with their hands i was up in the air as though for the last time i took a really deep breath and closed my eyes and somehow braced myself inside i suddenly became cold as though my heart had sunk into my feet and suddenly i felt myself flying i could n't figure out if i was really flying or if i just imagined it when i came to i thought now i 'm going to smash on the ground and when it did n't happen i opened my eyes and realized that i was still lying on the floor and since i did n't scream did n't beg them at all they became all the more wild like wolves they started to trample me with their feet shoes with heels on them and iron horseshoes like they had spe- cially put them on then i lost consciousness i came to a couple of times and waited for death summoned it beseeched it some people ask for good health life happiness but at that moment i did n't need any of those things i was sure that none of us would survive and i had even forgotten about marina and if none of us was alive it was n't worth living there was a moment when the pain was especially great i withstood inhuman pain and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because i had showed myself to be so tenacious i started to strangle myself and when i started to wheeze they realized that with my death i was going to put an end to their pleasures and they pulled my hands from my throat the person who injured and insulted me most painfully i remember him very well because he was the oldest in the group he looked around i know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person one who would never do such a thing something came over him then you see even during the investigation he almost called me `` daughter '' he apologized although of course he knew that i 'd never forgive him something like that i can never forgive i have never injured anyone with my behavior with my words or with my deeds i have always put myself in the other person 's shoes but then in a matter of hours they trampled me entirely i shall never forget it i wanted to do myself in then because i had nothing to lose because no one could protect me my father who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself could do nothing and would n't be able to do anything i knew that i was even sure that he was no longer alive and ira melkumian my acquaintance i knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times -- her brother tried to save her and could n't so he tried to kill her his very own sister he threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffering when they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room her brother knew what awaited her i do n't know which one it was edik or igor both of them were in the room from which the axe was thrown but the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in sumgait i heard about it all from the neighbor from the melkumians landing his name is makhaddin he knows my family a little he came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in baku how we were feeling and if we needed anything he 's a good person he said '' you should praise god that you all survived but what i saw with my own eyes i a man who has seen so many people die who has lived a whole life i '' he says `` nearly lost my mind that day i had never seen the likes of it and think i never shall again '' the door to his apartment was open and he saw everything one of the brothers threw the axe because they had already taken the father and mother out of the apartment igor edik and ira remained he saw ira naked being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people he told us about it and said he would never forget it he heard the brothers shouting something inarticulate from pain rage and the fact that they were powerless to do anything but all the same they tried to do something the guy who got hit with the axe lived i i after i had been unsuccessful at killing myself i saw them taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom i was in such a state that i could n't even remember my sister 's name i wanted to cry `` marina '' out to her but could not i looked at her and knew that it was a familiar dear face but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was and thus i saved her because when they were taking her out she as it turns out had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and lyuda were both there by chance that they were n't armenians lyuda 's a russian you can tell right away and marina speaks azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an azerbaijani and i almost gave her away and doomed her i 'm glad that at least marina came out of this all in good physical health although her spirit was murdered at some point i came to and saw igor igor agayev my acquaintance in that mob he lives in the neighboring building for some reason i remembered his name maybe i sensed my defense in him i called out to him in russian `` igor help '' but he turned away and went into the bedroom just then they were taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom igor said he knew marina and lyuda that marina in fact was azerbaijani and he took both of them to the neighbors and the idea stole through me that maybe igor had led them to our apartment something like that but if he was my friend he was supposed to save me then they were striking me very hard -- we have an indian vase a metal one they were hitting me on the back with it and i blacked out -- they took me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window they were already sure that i was dead because i did n't react at all to the new blows someone said `` she 's already dead let 's throw her out '' when they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time when i was about to die the second time i heard someone say in azerbaijani `` do n't kill her i know her she 's a teacher '' i can still hear that voice ringing in my ears but i ca n't remember whose voice it was it was n't igor because he speaks azerbaijani with an accent his mother is russian and they speak russian at home he speaks azerbaijani worse than our marina does i remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me that person and i having opened my eyes saw and recognized that person but immediately passed out cold i had been beaten so much that i did n't have the strength to remember him i only remember that this person was older and he had a high position unfortunately i ca n't remember anything more what should i say about igor he did n't treat me badly i had heard a lot about him that he was n't that good a person that he sometimes drank too much once he boasted to me that he had served in afghanistan he knew that women usually like bravery in a man especially if a man was in afghanistan if he was wounded then it 's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically with respect later i found out that he had served in ufa and was injured but that 's not in afghanistan of course i found that all out later among the people who were in our apartment my karina also saw the secretary of the party organization i do n't know his last name his first name is najaf he is an armenian-born azerbaijani but later karina was n't so sure she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw and she did n't want to endanger him she said `` he was there '' and a little while later `` maybe they beat me so much that i am confusing him with someone else no it seems like it was he '' i am sure it was he because when he came to see us the first time he said one thing and the next time he said something entirely different the investigators have n't summoned him yet he came to see us in the khimik boarding house where we were living at the time he brought groceries and flowers this was right before march 8th he almost started crying he was so upset to see our condition i do n't know if he was putting us on or not but later after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the procuracy he said that he had been in baku he was n't in sumgait the fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that karina is right that in fact it was he who was in our apartment i do n't know how the investigators are now treating him at one point i wondered and asked and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment could n't he have gone to baku and arranged an alibi i 'm not ruling out that possibility ill now return to our apartment mamma had come to you could say that she bought them off with the gold father gave her when they were married her wedding band and her watch were gold she bought her own and her husband 's lives with them she gave the gold to a 14-year old boy vadim vorobyev a russian boy he speaks azerbaijani perfectly he 's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in sumgait on nizami street he goes to a special school one for mentally handicapped children but i 'll say this -- i 'm a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes i can form an opinion -- that boy is not at all mentally handicapped he 's healthy he can think just fine and analyze too policemen should be so lucky and he 's cunning too after that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album he beat mamma and demanded gold saying `` lady if you give us all the gold and money in your apartment we 'll let you live '' and mamma told them where the gold was he brought in the bag and opened it shook out the contents and everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it started knocking each other over and taking the gold from one another i 'm surprised they did n't kill one another right then mamma was still in control of herself she had been beaten up her face was black and blue from the blows and her eyes were filled with blood and she ran into the other room father was lying there tied up with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face there was a broken table on top of the pil- low mamma grabbed father and he could n't walk like me he was half dead halfway into the other world he could n't comprehend anything could n't see and was covered with black and blue mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth it was some sort of cloth i think it was a slipcover from an armchair the bandits were still in our apartment even in the room mamma pulled father out of led him out of carried him out of we had two armchairs in that room a small magazine table a couch a television and a screen three people were standing next to that screen and into their shirts their pants everywhere imaginable they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service -- mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye she said `` i was afraid to turn around i just seized father and started pulling him but at the threshold i could n't hold him up he fell down and i picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors '' mamma remembered one of the criminals the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her out of one eye she says `` i realized that my death would come from that person i looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing '' later they caught that scoundrel meanwhile mamma grabbed father and left i was alone igor had taken marina away mamma and father were gone karina was already outside i did n't know what they were doing to her i was left all alone and at that moment i became someone else do you understand even though i knew that neither mother and father in the other room nor marina and lyuda under the bed could save me all the same i somehow managed to hold out i went on fighting them i bit someone i remember and i scratched another but when i was left alone i realized what kind of people they were the ones i had observed the ones who beat karina what kind of people they were the ones who beat me that it was all unnecessary that i was about to die and that all of that would die with me at some point i took heart when i saw the young man from the next building i did n't know his name but we would greet one another when we met we knew that we were from the same microdistrict when i saw him i said `` neighbor is that you '' in so doing i placed myself in great danger he realized that if i lived i would remember him that 's when he grabbed the axe the axe that had been taken from my father i automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to take the blow of the axe although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery when he started getting ready to wind back for the blow someone came into the room the newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor 's axe froze in the air everyone stood at attention for this guy like soldiers in the presence of a general everyone waited for his word continue the atrocities or not he said `` enough let 's go to the third entryway '' in the third entryway they killed uncle shurik aleksandr gambarian this confirms once again that they had prepared in advance almost all of them left with him as they went picking up pillows blankets whatever they needed whatever they found all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot someone else had already taken the other four people remained in the room soldiers who did n't obey their general they had to have come recently because other faces had flashed in front of me over those to hours but i had never seen those three one of them kuliyev i identified him later a native of the sisian district of armenia an azerbaijani had moved to azerbaijan a year before he told me in armenian '' sister do n't be afraid i 'll drive those three azerbaijanis out of here '' that 's just what he said `` those azerbaijanis '' as though he himself were not azerbaijani but some other nationality he said with such hatred `` i 'll drive them out of here now and you put your clothes on and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut because they 'll be coming back from apartment '' that 's when i found out that they had gone to apartment before that the person in the eskimo dogskin coat the one who came in and whom they listened to the `` general '' said that they were going to the third entryway kuliyev helped me get some clothes on because l could n't do it by myself marina 's old fur coat was lying on the floor he threw it over my shoulders i was racked with shivers and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer he wanted to give them to me so that when he left i could nail the door shut but the door was lying on the floor in the hall i went out onto the balcony there were broken windows and flowers and dirt from flowerpots were scattered on the floor it was impossible to find anything he told me `` well fine i wo n't leave you here would any of the neighbors let you in they 'll be back they wo n't calm down they know you 're alive '' he told me all this in armenian then he returned to the others and said `` what are you waiting for leave '' they said `` ah you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her yourself no we want to do it to '' he urged them on but gently not coarsely because he was alone against them although they were still just boys not old enough to be drafted he led them out of the room and went down to the third floor with them himself and said `` leave what 's the mat- ter are n't you men go fight with the men what do you want of her '' and he came back upstairs they wanted to come up after him and he realized that he could n't hold them off forever then he asked me where he could hide me i told him at the neighbors on the fourth floor apartment we were on really good terms with them we knocked on the door and he explained in azerbaijani the neighbor woman opened the door and immediately said `` i 'm an azerbaijani '' he said `` i know let her sit at your place a while do n't open the door to anyone no one knows about this i wo n't tell anyone let her stay at your place '' she says `` fine have her come in '' i went in she cried a bit and gave me some stockings i had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders i burst into tears even though i was wearing marina 's old fur coat it 's a short one a half-length i was cold all the same i asked `` do you know where my family is what happened to them '' she says `` no i do n't know anything i 'm afraid to go out of the apartment now they 're so wild that they do n't look to see who 's azerbaijani and who 's armenian '' kuliyev left ten minutes later my neighbor says `` you know lyuda i do n't want to lose my life because of you or my son and his wife go stay with someone else '' during the butchery in our apartment one of the scum a sadist took my earring in his mouth -- i had pearl earrings on -- and ripped it out tearing the earlobe the other earring was still there when i 'm nervous i fix my hair constantly and then when i touched my ear i noticed that i had one earring on i took it out and gave it to her she took the earring but she led me out of the apartment i went out and did n't know where to go i heard someone going upstairs i do n't know who it was but assumed it was them with tremendous difficulty i end up to our apartment i wanted to die in my own home i go into the apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place to the fifth floor i had to do something i went into the bedroom where marina and lyuda had hidden and saw that the bed was overturned instead of hiding i squatted near some broken christmas ornaments found an unbroken one and started sobbing then they came in someone said that there were still some things to take i think that someone pushed me under the bed i lay on the floor and there were broken ornaments on it under my head and legs i got all cut up but i lay there without moving my heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town could hear it there were no lights on maybe that 's what saved me they were burning matches and toward the end they brought in a candle they started picking out the clothes that could still be worn they took father 's sport jacket and a bedspread the end of which was under my head they pulled on the one end and it felt like they were pulling my hair out i almost cried out and again i realized i was n't getting out of there alive and i started to strangle myself again i took my throat in one hand and pressed the other on my mouth so as not to wheeze so that i would die and they would only find me afterward they were throwing the burned matches under the bed and i got burned but i withstood it something inside of me held on someone 's hand was protecting me to the end i knew that i was going to die but i did n't know how i knew that if i survived i would walk out of that apartment but if i found out that one of my family had died i would die for sure because i had never been so close to death and could n't imagine how you could go on living without your mother or father or without your sister marina i thought was still alive she went to lyuda 's place or someone is hiding her i tried to think that igor would n't let them be killed he served in afghanistan he should protect her while i was strangling myself i said my good-byes to everyone and then i thought how could marina survive alone if they killed all of us how would she live all by herself there were six people in the room they talked among themselves and smoked one talked about his daughter saying that there was no children 's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter another said that he liked the apartment -- recently we had done a really good job fixing everything up -- and that he would live there after everything was all over they started to argue a third one says `` how come you get it i have four children and there are three rooms here that 's just what i need all these years i 've been living in god-awful places '' another one says '' neither of you gets it we 'll set fire to it and leave '' then someone said that azerbaijanis live right next door the fire could move over to their place and they to my good fortune did n't set fire to the apartment and left oh yes i just remembered while they were raping me they repeated quite frequently `` let the armenian women have babies for us muslim babies let them bear azerbaijanis for the struggle against the armenians '' then they said `` those muslims can carry on our holy cause heroes '' they repeated it very often reference for _the sumgait tragedy pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan volume i eyewitness accounts_ edited by samuel shahmuradian forward by yelena

buch of crap and you know it nagarno-karabagh has always been part of armenia and it was stalin who gave it to the azeris go back and review the history if a 'dog 's prayers were answered bones would rain from the sky did you know that the word 'karabag itself is a 'turkish name before before the russians and their 'zavalli kole armenians drove all the turks/muslims out it was a turkish majority town well anyway it is not surprising that armenians also collaborated with the nazis `` wholly opportunistic the dashnaktzoutun have been variously pro-nazi pro-russia pro-soviet armenia pro-arab pro-jewish as well as anti-jewish anti-zionist anti-communist and anti-soviet whichever was expedient `` john roy carlson arthur derounian 'cairo to damascus alfred a. knopf new york p. as a dear friend put it the tzeghagrons armenian racial patriots was the youth organization of the dashnaktzoutun it was based in boston where asala/sdpa/arf terrorism triangle is located but had followers in armenian colonies all over the world literally tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one 's race the architect of the armenian racial patriots was garegin nezhdeh a nazi armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with hitler in world war ii in he had been invited to the united states by the central committee of the dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the american-armenian youth nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local armenian youth groups in the tzeghagrons starting with chapters in the initial year the tzeghagrons grew to chapters and became the largest and most powerful nazi armenian organization nezhdeh also provided the tzeghagrons with a philosophy `` the racial religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity race above everything and before everything race comes first `` quoted in john roy carlson real name arthur derounian `` the armenian displaced persons '' in 'armenian affairs winter 1949-50 p. footnote now wait there is more the gruesome extent of february 's killings of azeris by armenians in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan about men women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four-year war over nagorny karabakh the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates the february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four-year campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief-stricken azerbaijan 's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2,000 dead the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of a 15-man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the `` hojali disaster '' said his figure of people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov the mayor of hojali an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may dead people named and more than bodies reported unidentified this figure of nearly dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of the international red cross in baku said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of bodies received at his mosque from hojali most of them civilians `` we did not count the bodies but the figure seems reasonable it is no fantasy '' mr zen ruffinen said `` we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead '' mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre `` do n't get worked up it will take several months to get a final figure '' the 43-year-old lawyer said at his small office mr rasulov knows about these things it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that people were killed and wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january those nationalists the popular front finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali an azeri town which lies about miles from the border with armenia fell to the armenians officially people have so far been certified as dead being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic 's forensic department `` this is just a small percentage of the dead '' said rafiq youssifov the republic 's chief forensic scientist `` they were the only bodies brought to us remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within hours '' of these people were women and were children under years old gunshots killed people shrapnel killed and axes or blunt instruments killed exposure in the highland snows killed the last three thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out according to professor youssifov's report those bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed mr rasulov said files from mr rasulov 's investigative commission are still disorganised lists of azeri militiamen are dead here six policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the names of corpses brought to be washed in just one day the most heartbreaking account from witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on february `` there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly 470-500 in hojali 650-700 people by the stream and the road and 85-100 visible around nakhchivanik village '' mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot `` people waved up to us for help we saw three dead children and one two-year-old alive by one dead woman the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return '' there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces the independent london 12/6/'92 serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks

18, document_id from nstramer supergas.dazixco.ingr.com naftaly stramer subject the hamas way of death the hamas way of death following is a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape made last summer by the qassam battalions the military arm of hamas an islamic palestinian group hamas figures significantly in the middle east equation in december israel deported more than palestinians to lebanon in response to hamas 's kidnapping and execution of an israeli soldier a longer version appears in the may issue of harper 's magazine which obtained and translated the tape my name is yasir hammad al-hassan ali i live in nuseirat a refugee camp in the gaza strip i was born in i finished high school then attended gaza polytechnic later i went to work for islamic university in gaza as a clerk i 'm married and i have two daughters the qassam battalions are the only group in palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad holy war our primary concern is palestinians who collaborate with the enemy many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the israeli security services since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration to do so we abduct collaborators intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure palestinians into collaboration in the first place in addition to that naturally we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them we do n't execute every collaborator after all about percent of them are innocent victims tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds the decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes if like many collaborators he has been recruited as an agent of the israeli border guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once he 's as dangerous as an israeli soldier so we treat him like an israeli soldier there 's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators i regard the `` isqat '' the process by which a palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator if someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat than it is our religious duty to execute him a third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics they work on direct orders from the security services to distribute drugs as widely as possible their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more they collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave the dealers must also be executed in the battalions we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators we ca n't afford to abduct an innocent person because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever we will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before if after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt then he is executed in many cases we do n't have to make our evidence against collaborators public because everyone knows that they 're guilty but when the public is n't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator and we accuse him people are bound to ask for evidence many people will proclaim his innocence so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed this proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession at first every collaborator denies his crimes so we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him we tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people even in the last moment of his life by confessing and giving us the information we need we say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim that kind of talk is convincing most of them confess after that others hold out in those cases we apply pressure both psychological and physical then the holdouts confess as well only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation in that case the collaborator had been seen working for the border guard since before the intifada and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend who disclosed the information to us in addition three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat with this much evidence there was no need to interrogate him but we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions in every case our principal is the same the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes a few weeks ago we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation an although we had hundreds of names still because of our fear of god and of hell we could not mark any of these men except for the one i just mentioned for execution when we execute a collaborator in public we use a gun but after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator we ca n't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations that 's why collaborators are strangled sometimes we ask the collaborator `` what do you think how should we execute you '' one collaborator told us '' strangle me '' he hated the sight of blood -- -- naftaly stramer intergraph electronics internet nstramer dazixco.ingr.com lookout

subject rejoinder questions to israelis to shaig think.com subject ten questions to israelis dear shai in the answer to my first question concerning the nonexistence of israeli nationality your answer conflicts with information i have received from other quarters according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying israelis citizenship ezrahut and nationality le'um the former is used on passports etc and the later for daily identification in israeli society i am told that people in israel have to carry their id cards at all times and present them at many public places almost every day these id cards make clear who the holder is a jew or an arab you maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided but do you really believe that this is the reason could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose a number of points you are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used true by law all residents citizens and tourists must carry a form of identification with them for citizens the standard id is the id card the purpose this serves on a daily basis wherein they are presented at public places is for the purpose of identifying the bearer this takes place in banks cashing checks post offices registered mail and such etc ... quite frankly it was rare that i ever had to present my id card for such activities more than once per week there is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their id cards in public furthermore none of the services i outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information the only case that i can think of in which the le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police based upon the scenario in general though arab citizens are clearly recognizable as are non-arabs your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially in the answer to my second questions concerning the fact that israel has no fixed borders you state that israel 's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace according to what i read the first zionists in the beginning of the century had plans for the jewish state to extend into what is lebanon and into transjordan jordan i also read that it was the express wish of ben-gurion to not declare israel 's borders when israel was established as this might restrict israel 's opportunities for later expansion israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that jews lived there years ago or that god promised the land to them but according to biblical sources the area god promised would extend all the way to iraq and what were the borders in biblical times which israel considers proper to use today finally if israel wants peace why ca n't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a base for negotiations having all the above facts in mind one can not blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism as a number of wars have proved i take issue with your assertions i think that arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from `` israeli expansionism '' militarily israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile armed and insurgent population for a sustained period of time as is the intifada is heavily taxing the israeli economy proof of this can be seen in the israeli withdrawal from lebanon israeli troops pulled back from the awali and later from the litani in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of katyusha missile fire public opinion in israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions the israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it with regards to borders let me state the following i may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position the arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders if israel were to state large borders the negotiations might never get under way if israel were to state smaller borders then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations i think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible your answer to my third question is typical of a stalinist public official i do n't think your answer is honest you refer me to vanunu 's revelations about israel 's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations now if he said the truth then why should he been punished and if he lied why should he be punished i would appreciate more honesty your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a `` center for policy research '' whether or not all of vanunu 's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were for disclosing `` state secrets '' after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public one should be punished as to which were and which were n't i am under no moral obligation to disclose that quite the reverse in fact he was taken to court tried and found guilty you may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of `` secrets of state '' something which every democratic govt has somebody provided an answer to the fourth question concerning 'hidden prisoners in israeli prisons he posted an article from ma'ariv documenting such cases it seems that such prisoners do exist in israel what do you think about that i noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist the clu noted which you evidently did not pay attention to that they know of no such reports or cases i am sorry to tell you but in a country of mill as tightly knit as israel even if the matter of the arrest was not made public within a relatively short time frame most people would know about it my own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of x hours this would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation you imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon israel such terms have often been used by the soviet union against dissidents they call the soviet union into disrepute if my questions are not disturbing they would not call forth such hysterical answers my questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts i would be very happy if you could convince me that what i am told about israel were just fabrications but alas you have failed to do so i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion this is a sign of weakness not of strength well i am sorry to say that your questions are slanted such questions are often termed `` tabloid journalism '' and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity such questions were often used during the mccarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then to use your own example these questions might have been lifted from the format used by stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture my answers were not any more `` hysterical '' than the questions themselves the problem is not that the q 's were provocative it was that they were selective in their fact seeking you fall into the same category of those who seek `` yes '' `` no '' answers when the real answer is `` of sorts '' i suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal no you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit a sign of strength is the ability to look you remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect the color blindness you exhibit is a true sign of weakness i hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth ditto -- shai guday stealth bombers os software engineer thinking machines corp.

______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april remarks by the president to law enforcement organizations the rose garden 2:52 p.m. edt the president good afternoon ladies and gentlemen two months ago i presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the american people their jobs and their economic future the federal budget plan passed congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country then the short-term jobs plan i presented to congress which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the house of representatives two weeks ago it now has the support of a majority of the united states senate all of these members of congress know it 's time to get the economy moving again to get job growth going again to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity unfortunately a minority of the members of the united states senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs bill when congress returns i ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at stake the issue is not politics it 's people sixteen million of them are looking for full-time jobs and ca n't find them these men and women do n't care about who 's up or down in washington they care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day 's work and supporting their families and drawing a paycheck they 're asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward i am prepared to do that and i have been working with the senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs plan i 'm willing to compromise so long as we keep the focus on jobs keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs our opponents have been asking for a smaller package today i ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the american people but even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller i believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of americans and one in particular and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime so i will ask even in this reduced package for an additional million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national recession together with a matching effort by local governments this could put as many as 10,000 police officers back on the job and back on the beat in communities all across our nation at a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments america can make and i ask both houses of congress to make that investment in our people 's safety and in their piece of mind i believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs make no mistake about it i will fight for these priorities as hard as i ever have i will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs their future and for fundamental change i want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that i had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police officers they came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the package and i want them to be free to talk about that they came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful future i say what i say today not just because it 's good for law enforcement but because it 's good for the people who live in these communities i have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they 're hired to protect it reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time these are the kinds of things that we are trying to do i promised in my campaign that i 'd do everything i could to put another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four years this makes a good downpayment on that this keeps in mind the core of the jobs package and this will help us to move forward so i ask the people in the senate who have blocked the jobs bill let 's work together i can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe streets i do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting prosperity for our people i have done my part now to end the gridlock i ask you to do yours i want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the american people -- beginning with janet reno the distinguished attorney general q mr. president can you tell us -- do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a vat tax at this point in the congressional dialogue the president not at all i think it should have -- they would n't have any relationship one to the other first of all i made absolutely no decision on that you should know that there 's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this economy but i have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax q do you personally believe that the american public is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care i mean apart from what business and labor leaders have said -- the president i 'm not going to speculate on that i will say this the real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the cost i mean that is -- everyone knows that if you do what we 're proposing to do if you streamline the insurance system if you fix the system so that there 's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain services if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it is n't now every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care system the real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security i have no idea the polls say that but i do n't know all i know is the polls that i see in the press that many of you have commissioned they say overwhelmingly the american people want the security of an affordable health care system but i do n't think that has anything to do with this stimulus and it certainly should n't have people want a job first and foremost they want that more than anything else q now that you 've announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable i assume summer jobs is one the president i want the summer jobs i want the highway program and i want the police program i still intend -- let me say this i still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill which did not pass the congress last year this is a supplement to that not a substitute for it in any way but i think we need to do that i think we need the ryan white funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with aids and there are several other things that i think should be done we have to do the agriculture department meat inspectors the safety of the public depends on that there are a number of other things that i do n't -- i do n't think any of it should be cut but i have given senator mitchell and senator byrd -- i talked to them and senator dole called me yesterday to discuss this and i told him that i would call him back i called him back last night in new hampshire and we discussed this and i basically asked them to talk today and said that i would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord so i do n't want to be any more specific than i have been already and let 's see if they can talk it out q when you talked to senator dole and senator mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also that million that you want that as part of the package the president i did -- i told senator -- i left word for senator mitchell last night about it when i talked to senator dole -- i do n't remember for sure -- i do not believe i mentioned it but i did tell him that i was prepared to reduce the package and i wanted to break the gridlock and i told him that i was working on a reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that i thought the american people wanted us to address and this is certainly consistent with that thank you end3:12 p.m. edt"

_____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april press briefing by george stephanopoulos the briefing room 1:04 p.m. edt mr. stephanopoulos good afternoon q could we do this on the lawn mr. stephanopoulos that would be nice let 's go out to the cherry blossoms we 'll do like the president q is the stimulus package dead mr. stephanopoulos absolutely not q can you tell us more about the dole talks you said it was a good visit but no compromise mr. stephanopoulos yes the president had a good talk with senator dole last night i think that as we said before there were no specific compromises on either side although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as well as you know the president first called senator dole i believe tuesday night to talk about the russian aid package they did not speak -- senator dole called him back wednesday morning -- when the president was out instead he spoke with tony lake and at the close of that conversation indicated that he wanted to speak to the president about the jobs and stimulus package they finally talked about that yesterday afternoon at the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night which they did when the senator was up in new hampshire and although there were no specific compromises made on either side they did say that they would continue to have some discussions and that 's where we are q well who is giving in where is it standing -- are both making concessions mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know that it 's at that phase no compromise has been made as the president has said consistently he intends to come forward with an adjusted package he believes in the package but he believes that if it 's going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it he 's willing to make those adjustments q on the subject of a vat -- mr. stephanopoulos oh boy q can we stay on this for one more minute mr. stephanopoulos sure q we have a problem with the five minutes -- q i know no decisions have been made but what would lead the health group to believe that a vat might be necessary mr. stephanopoulos sorry andrea i 'm not going to go down that road no decisions have been made as the president said this morning a number of groups a number of members of congress a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked at the working group is looking at it but no decisions have been made q to follow have they done that directly through him have labor and business groups been in touch with the president about it mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge although there 's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the vat but the president has not made a decision q at the meetings that he 's had with his own task force advisers have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think that that has been presented for a decision no q not for a decision but has it been discussed as an option mr. stephanopoulos again there are a lot of levels of briefing i do not believe that the vat has been presented to the president as okay this is something for you to decide on q you 're not saying he did n't know it was being considered though are you mr. stephanopoulos no he said it 's being considered q he knew that q but has he discussed that with his advisers that 's what i 'm asking mr. stephanopoulos the president has said it 's being considered i do not know what level of discussion there has been over the vat it is something the working groups are looking at i do n't even know that it 's -- q but he did n't say he was considering did he at this stage mr. stephanopoulos no he is not i think we 're getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here what is considered -- q well he is the one who said i have n't reviewed it mr. stephanopoulos that is true that is what i just repeated q george is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in february and the promise that if it were to be considered he 'd let us know and having it trickle out the way it did that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think so i mean it is now public knowledge that this is being considered q is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered and then to have it come out not from you people but -- mr. stephanopoulos well wait a second it came out from the administration what are you talking about q what i 'm saying is though that the president said he would let us know mr. stephanopoulos right q you people then said -- you said i believe that it 's not going to be on the program mr. stephanopoulos on march 25th q on march 25th mr. stephanopoulos circumstances change q well i understand but we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview mr. stephanopoulos rooting around -- i know you did do a very good job there to read the usa today article but this is -- laughter -- the deputy director of the omb and the secretary of health and human services i mean that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the clinton administration the headline is -- i 'll look at it right here and ap story -- `` clinton wants more money for spying '' q what about his remark that if it were being considered he 'd tell us about it mr. stephanopoulos and the administration 's concerned and he 'd let you know q and did he mr. stephanopoulos yes absolutely what did he say this morning q it had to be dragged out of you here yesterday mr. stephanopoulos it did n't have to be dragged out of me we had the deputy director of the omb we had the secretary of health of human services say it was being considered that is his administration that is his administration policy q were these authorized trial balloons or were they orchestrated leaks i mean what was the -- mr. stephanopoulos they were asked questions they answered the questions q you 're saying here that it did n't have to be dragged out that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering it mr. stephanopoulos absolutely i was very clear painfully clear q was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day mr. stephanopoulos no it was just this issue is being considered they were asked if it was being considered they answered that it was being considered q george the new york times -- q why do it yesterday mr. stephanopoulos they were asked q the new york times reports today that secretary reich and the chief economist at the labor department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last month 's unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the president 's job stimulus bill but which turned out to be totally false mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know if it was totally false but i think -- laughter -- the chief economist at the labor department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing and they say that q the question is is the president concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data and what 's he doing about it if so mr. stephanopoulos the chief economist has said that a mistake was made it wo n't happen again and that 's the end of the matter q is n't that the same information that goes to the president q if i could go back to the stimulus package -- mr. stephanopoulos there 's two separate pieces of information i think that 's where the confusion was q when did you all first learn about this mistake that was made mr. stephanopoulos i read the article this morning q and as far as you know is the president aware of it mr. stephanopoulos i think so q and was he aware of it before he read about it in the new york times mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know not to my knowledge q did you ever hear about it before this morning anything mr. stephanopoulos i did n't q was n't the president given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose for his speeches for his arguments mr. stephanopoulos well again i 'm not sure both statements are true what the labor department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence essentially was misleading they said it was a mistake they said they would n't do it again q did they drop it -- is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of mr. stephanopoulos whenever fewer people are out of work we 're gratified but that does n't take away from the need to get this jobs package going q if i could go back to the stimulus package for a minute you said that the president plans to come forward with an amendment is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment would be laid down on monday and voted on on tuesday or did he in the conversation with dole talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion mr. stephanopoulos i think at this point there 's no changes in the schedule at all i do n't know that they discussed the timing like that q do you believe that you 're closer or getting closer this week than you were last week mr. stephanopoulos again i believe that we 're going to pass a jobs package the president is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to happen i do n't know where the votes are on cloture at this particular time i do n't know what 's going to happen until we have a vote but the president believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done q has there been any indication that this situation has changed mr. stephanopoulos we 're going to continue to work on it we 'll know when the votes are taken q george last week you said that there are -- or various people in the administration were saying that you could n't go through dole you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept this week you 're talking to him is that because you 've realized that the peeling off effort was n't going to work mr. stephanopoulos that 's because senator dole wanted to talk to the president about the stimulus package q he initiated the conversation mr. stephanopoulos yes q secretary reich this morning said that in fact the president is not willing to compromise on this bill at all you say he 's making -- mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know that that 's exactly what he said i think he said he did n't have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise and the president does n't want to compromise and the president does n't want to compromise but if he has to make adjustments to get it through he will q officials here yesterday said that panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual vote mr. stephanopoulos it 's possible q today mr. stephanopoulos i 'm not sure exactly when that will happen but i think that it 's very possible that we 'll come forward with some sort of a different package or senate democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it passed q as we understood his conversations with dole the first one was some discussion of this and i 'll get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments or whatever the phrase is did he offer him some details or some adjustments mr. stephanopoulos i think it 's a question of how detailed i mean i think they had a general discussion about the package last night subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon i believe that there will be follow-up discussions today in the senate not necessarily between the president and senator dole and let me just reiterate neither side has made specific compromises at this date when we have something we 'll let you know and i 'm not suggesting that senator dole has accepted anything that we 've talked about or that we 've offered anything in a hard way q what are the follow-up discussions if not the president and dole mr. stephanopoulos i think senator mitchell is going to talk to senator dole q is that a threat laughter q did the president say to senator dole all right how about this number as an overall size or did dole say to the president i can go as high as this did they talk numbers mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think it was a negotiation in that respect it was more of a discussion about their positions q did they discuss actual numbers mr. stephanopoulos i 'm just not sure i know they talked about the basic outlines of the packages i think they talked about the programs they cared about i do n't know if they got to the level of this many x-billion dollars q does dole have to sign off before there is a package mr. stephanopoulos no of course not q did the white house have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in new hampshire today where senator dole was speaking was that in any way organized by -- mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge no q and has the president been in touch with senators kohl or feingold mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think he 's talked to them no q george is the president considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots and is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few with the haves having to pay for the have-nots mr. stephanopoulos the president believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income americans as he presented in his budget should go up and i think for the second half of your question i 'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday q george on the subject of accuracy in information you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in milwaukee apparently that is not true it 's actually waste water money mr. stephanopoulos it 's waste water money for wisconsin and some could go to milwaukee q but it would not affect the drinking water problem because it 's waste water money right mr. stephanopoulos it would affect the water treatment overall q but the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in milwaukee now would you agree that 's not the case mr. stephanopoulos i 'm not sure of the specifics i know that it goes to the overall water treatment in wisconsin q a leftover question from this morning which was when did the president find out that the task force was deliberating on a vat mr. stephanopoulos i 'm not sure exactly when i just do n't know i assume it came up over the last -- certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago q so sometime since march 25th mr. stephanopoulos i think that 's right i do n't know the exact date q george the president this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the vat tax apparently the national association of manufacturers talks about perhaps the vat tax being okay if it replaces the btu tax so does the president feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he 's proposed or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he 's already proposed mr. stephanopoulos i think we 've said all we have to say about the vat at this point i mean there 's just no -- this is being considered by the health care working groups and that is all the president has n't made any further decisions beyond that q but it would be to finance health care it would n't be to replace some other tax that finances -- it would n't replace the income tax for instance mr. stephanopoulos there have been no discussions on that q in terms of getting a vat tax through congress senator dole 's press release today said vat -- on tax day do you think -- does it have a chance of getting through congress would it have a chance mr. stephanopoulos i have no idea q is that a consideration whether you all put it forward mr. stephanopoulos that would become a consideration if the president were to decide to do it it 's not in consideration now q you said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the vat to now be under consideration mr. stephanopoulos yes what the president referred to this morning these groups came forward and said this is something that has to be considered q those are the circumstances that have changed that 's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered mr. stephanopoulos that 's what he said q is that true mr. stephanopoulos yes q was there in fact some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits mr. stephanopoulos i 'm not going to get into the deliberations q but george -- mr. stephanopoulos no what the consideration is as the president said groups came forward and said this is something you ought to consider the working groups are looking at it q is that the only thing that 's changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the vat mr. stephanopoulos yes q can you explain how those groups -- how that information got to him that groups wanted it was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations mr. stephanopoulos i think the groups -- as you know the health care task force has met with dozens of groups q but this is the president 's knowledge that these groups had come forward mr. stephanopoulos i think he was referring to what was coming to the working groups obviously there have also been published positions in the newspapers q have certain groups briefed him on the group 's presentations to them mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know if they 've briefed him -- i mean how detailed the briefings have been i know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these groups q what kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the president would change the position that he had enunciated previously mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know it 's just they 've had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health care q the president was n't aware of those longstanding positions mr. stephanopoulos he may have been at some level obviously he 's been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a vat tax q what we 're trying to figure out here -- you 're telling us that the only change the only thing that affected this change in the president 's attitude toward the vat between february and now -- mr. stephanopoulos the president 's attitude has n't necessarily changed i mean he has not made a decision q i know but the president said that it was off the table so did you and you 're saying that the only thing that 's changed is the positions of these groups except you 're also describing them as longstanding positions i do n't see the change if these groups have n't had any change in their position that 's been made to the president -- mr. stephanopoulos well they 've made the presentations to the health care task force q there 's no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in february that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance -- mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think he ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue q well he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health care mr. stephanopoulos he did say that i do n't know that he said anything to refute that q but in fact has the task force discovered that there would n't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits -- mr. stephanopoulos again i do n't think that the task force ever suggested that there would q george if he advocated a vat tax would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs mr. stephanopoulos i ca n't comment on a hypothetical situation q but does that promise -- would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a vat tax mr. stephanopoulos the president has made no decisions on the vat tax when he does we 'll tell you and we 'll explain the implications then q which specific groups can you cite -- business labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration mr. stephanopoulos i do n't have the specific i just do n't have that q george can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives for instance the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are mr. stephanopoulos no as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said they are looking at a wide variety of options i think that ira magaziner said that there are different options under consideration but i 'm not going to comment -- q what 's the scope -- mr. stephanopoulos i 'm just not going to comment on them no q what 's the scope of the need how much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the -- mr. stephanopoulos that 's what the health care task force is looking at q since there 's not going to be any briefing on the miyazawa visit two questions one generally what does the president hope to use that meeting for but more specifically is his task complicated by the japanese anger over the vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference mr. stephanopoulos the vancouver note q does no mean yes q yes and no mr. stephanopoulos well i do n't know i saw the prime minister 's press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the question the questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the prime minister and the president there is obviously a trade imbalance between japan and the u.s. that we want to do something about q also in those comments the prime minister made he suggested that the united states should come down heavy on him in terms of trade are you going to oblige mr. stephanopoulos i think the president will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very clearly i do n't necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the prime minister 's comments q that we need specific export targets specific numerical targets -- is that what he 's going to discuss with miyazawa mr. stephanopoulos they 're going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issues i do n't want to get into those specifics until after the meeting q why q that 's the crux of the issue right whether or not -- does the president believe that without specific numerical targets it is really as he said in his press conference sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much mr. stephanopoulos the president believes that we must have pressure on japan to turn the trade imbalance around i do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be done q but does the president believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance mr. stephanopoulos i think first the president wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from prime minister miyazawa himself and then he 'll make the comment on it q how about the russian aid package there seems to be some confusion about how the u.s. views that secretary christopher saying -- or bentsen saying the japanese may need to do more the japanese saying that that 's not what they heard mr. stephanopoulos again we 're going to continue to work with all our allies in the g-7 and we 're going to continue to press for help for russian reform russian democratic reform and i think that so far we had a very good announcement out of tokyo and we 're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral packages q do you think the japanese need to do more mr. stephanopoulos we 're going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we can q secretary christopher was asked today on the today show this morning what he thought of margaret thatcher 's comments on the bosnia policy and he said `` it 's a rather emotional response '' mr. stephanopoulos over an emotional issue q right -- to an emotional problem does the white house condone that kind of remark mr. stephanopoulos i think that secretary christopher 's remarks speaks for itself the president believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that we 're trying to find answers for q but that specific -- `` rather emotional response '' -- specific term mr. stephanopoulos no it speaks for itself q in connection with that does n't it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment is it good american policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help boris yeltsin win a referendum mr. stephanopoulos for example q to take stronger action to take military action -- air strikes anything that can be done mr. stephanopoulos the president believes that what must be done now is to push harder for sanctions he is also -- as you know the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo he believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this time q what is your response to the critics who would say that the u.s. is now stymied by trying to help boris yeltsin retain the presidency mr. stephanopoulos they 're wrong we 're pressing hard for the serbs to come to the negotiating table we 're pressing hard for increased sanctions and we 're talking to our allies about the arms embargo q you were putting great store in vance and owen getting people to agree to that now vance and owen have both said that military force to some extent would be acceptable does that change your thinking mr. stephanopoulos clearly we 're going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say but at this point the president is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms embargo q a follow-up on a dee dee comment this morning she said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in bosnia are you going to be able to do that or do you have anything -- mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think that 's what she said q that 's exactly what she said mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think that 's true but what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in bosnia obviously if there are connections between the bosnian serbs and the serbs in belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the serbs in belgrade that will have an effect over time i do not know day by day minute by minute what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has been but clearly we are slowing the shipment of goods into belgrade we are having an effect on the serbs there what kind of effect that will eventually have on the bosnian serbs i do n't know but one thing i would say is if it were having no effect at all i do n't know why they 'd be fighting it so much q are the first lady 's tax returns going to be released mr. stephanopoulos i think there 's a joint tax return and it will be probably later today q is the president considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think there 's any proposal for that at this time not that i know of q it 's something that the president promised during the campaign that he would do mr. stephanopoulos i have not seen any -- i do n't think it 's anything that 's on his plate right now q is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know about on this issue i assume that he 'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and communities q do you know if that 's scheduled -- mr. stephanopoulos it 's probably going to be tomorrow q probably going to be tomorrow laughter q it 's a good thing you asked q who 's probably going to be there laughter mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know q how long -- mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know that 's all i know q do you know if it 's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow laughter mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know what time it is i do n't even know for sure if it 's going to be tomorrow q environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some kind is that going to happen do you know mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know if they 've asked but i think the president has always planned as he did last year to give a speech on earth day and i expect that he will if it 's not exactly on earth day it might be a day before or something like that q is he planning to sign or announce the signing of the biodiversity treaty in connection with earth day mr. stephanopoulos again i do n't know the specific timing of something like that but it 's certainly something under discussion and something we 've been working on q campaign finance reform mr. stephanopoulos we 're working on it q do you think it will be next week mr. stephanopoulos i 'm just not sure q the biodiversity treaty is something you 're working on i missed the question mr. stephanopoulos yes something we 're working on he asked if it was ready to be signed and i said i did n't know anything about that but it 's something we 've certainly been working on q do you know what organizations might be represented in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups mr. stephanopoulos i do n't q do you know if he is going to reconsider being out of town on the day of the march mr. stephanopoulos he 's got to be at the senate meeting in jamestown and i believe he 's also going to be giving a speech to the american association of newspaper publishers in boston on sunday as he did last year q would you have told us if she had not pressed you on the question mr. stephanopoulos on what q on the gays mr. stephanopoulos when we went through the president 's schedule for the day certainly q george what day is the publisher 's speech is that sunday mr. stephanopoulos i think it 's a sunday q and saturday he 'll be in jamestown mr. stephanopoulos yes q so you 're just going to be in jamestown for one day mr. stephanopoulos no i 'm not sure i do n't know how long the senate thing goes it might go overnight i just do n't know q you would have made the gay meeting public right mr. stephanopoulos i 'm certain if we had the meeting -- i do n't know about open to the press but we would have told you about it q i mean because it is as far as i can tell the first time in history a president has met in the oval office with -- mr. stephanopoulos i did n't say it was going to be in the oval office laughter but i did n't -- i 'm not say that it 's not but i did n't say that it was laughter q at the white house in the bush administration gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the white house had to repudiate having done that so i just wanted to make sure -- mr. stephanopoulos well the president would n't do anything like that q certainly not q what marching orders did the president give to general vessey mr. stephanopoulos they had a very good discussion for about half an hour today he wanted -- the most important thing was he had a full accounting for american pows and mias he will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document the president stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy towards vietnam he 'll be looking at vietnam 's response to the questions raised by the document and he 'll also look into investigations on discrepancy cases increased efforts on remains implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to military archives and ambassador toon also briefed the president on the activities of the joint commission and on the document q vietnam says it 's a fake what is the dod analysis at this stage mr. stephanopoulos it 's not completed yet and it 's also the first thing that general vessey will bring up with the vietnamese q a number of defense officials have been saying that they think that the or so prisoners referred to are in fact non-americans that the vietnamese had captured who they referred to as americans from time to time do people -- mr. stephanopoulos we do n't have any final determination we 're going to wait for the complete review when we have it we 'll make a judgment q i know you do n't have any final determination but given all of the intense public interest in this do you think that that 's a likely possibility mr. stephanopoulos i just do n't want to characterize it in any way until the review is complete q george was there a topic scheduled for the speech in boston mr. stephanopoulos no q is the president going to have a press conference tomorrow with miyazawa mr. stephanopoulos i think so but i 'm not positive yes i expect yes q was toon in with vessey mr. stephanopoulos yes q he was in on the meeting mr. stephanopoulos yes q what was the question mr. stephanopoulos was ambassador toon in with vessey and the answer is yes q do you have any response to the wall street journal report this morning the president 's distressed about some of his press clippings and that perhaps he 's distressed with you about that mr. stephanopoulos no well i do have a response i think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied that the president has had restricted access to the press i would point out that he 's answered questions on occasions more than any of his predecessors i would also point out it also -- q how many questions mr. stephanopoulos three hundred fifty-eight on occasions q how many were while he was jogging mr. stephanopoulos well no that 's actually a very good question andrea and i would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered at tightly controlled photo opportunities which is just patently false he 's had press conferences in either the east room the oval office or the roosevelt room or the briefing room in addition to questions taken at photo opportunities and that is only the -- q oval office press conference -- when was that mr. stephanopoulos he 's answered questions in the -- east room he 's had five in the east room he 's had one in the oval office he 's had one in the rose garden he 's had one or two in the roosevelt room and this is just to the white house washington press corps in addition to that he 's had interviews with local television anchors he 's met with the editorial board of the portland oregonian he 's had an hour-long interview with dan rather he 's had interviews with local press from california florida and connecticut -- q can you address the question of the attitude the article implies that he does n't -- q why does n't he like us laughter q did you really get blamed for that post story q the story is that you -- are you held responsible for it mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think i 'm going to comment about this q are you denying that the president has shown displeasure publicly mr. stephanopoulos i am not commenting on the discussions between the president and myself q did the president write that letter to chris webber mr. stephanopoulos what q the letter to the university of michigan basketball player mr. stephanopoulos oh yes q that is an authentic letter mr. stephanopoulos yes q since the president first talked about the vat in february he said at the time that he thought there probably should be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing does he still hold that position given the impact it could have mr. stephanopoulos again i just ca n't comment on a proposal he has n't made q george does the president have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow mr. stephanopoulos well i think it will just a general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about including aids and other issues -- civil rights q the military issue mr. stephanopoulos i 'm certain it will come up q is he using this event to name the aids -- mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think so q george what specifically is the president doing to prepare for tomorrow 's meeting with the prime minister miyazawa mr. stephanopoulos he 's had briefing memos he 's had general discussions with members of the treasury department the trade representative and others q report yet mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know if he has the report referred to in the times but ambassador kantor was here to brief him today q he was mr. stephanopoulos yes q does he intend to use any of these instances that -- mr. stephanopoulos again i do n't know that the report 's been presented but obviously the president will press hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred q in terms of the wall street journal the thrust was that there 's a real schism here -- a hostility do you think he feels that way mr. stephanopoulos not at all as i said on the record in the article i think the president likes reporters again i think that the thrust of the article was still misleading the thrust of the article was that in some way some attitude which the president may or may not have is affecting access when in fact he has the most open accessible administration than have any in recent history q can we come up to your office laughter mr. stephanopoulos if you 're invited the press thank you end 1:34 p.m. edt 57-04/15

19," document_id from gld cunixb.cc.columbia.edu gary l dare subject re eight myths about national health insurance pt ii harelb math.cornell.edu misc.activism.progressive co-moderator writes f o cus/health eight myths about national health insurance pt ii an office visit that 's in seattle is in vancouver canada that 's because among other things they 've given their government power to bargain with doctors and hospitals over fees the difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in canada along with france and germany without hmo 's -- the nyt has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to american doctors also minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple early march part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the french and germans do hey why do n't they criticize france and germany is it because too many people take french and german in college to make the accusations stick was to preserve the doctors independance since the provincial wings of the cma are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like britain 's national health service '' you 've got to remember you 've got a waiting list as well but it 's not as obvious if you 're poor and you do n't have insurance you do n't go to a surgeon in the states you ration by ability to pay '' for non-life threatening things market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand i have md friends who can't make a living as specialists back in manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they wo n't get enough customers -- the cma medical monopoly 's grip on doctors licencing as in the us aside -- so they must move to larger places however this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent and routine care as has been done in the u.s. by consumers reports health policy studies cited by prof. dennis e. shea on usenet cnn nyt etc doug fierro has posted a nyt article from weeks ago about canada's health insurance approach on talk.politics.medicine there is one small error in the article not all of our hospitals are private would n't national health insurance mean that americans who are now fully insured might have to settle for less in canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private hospital rooms -- so many canadians do end up buying some private insurance a policy to cover all of these things runs about to a month of course the one thing to note is that in the canada/france/germany case private insurance offloaded the basic coverage to the public sector they realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms vs. ward accomodation dental glasses etc for corporate or personal benefits they 'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care at that point they would n't even consider a `` voucher '' approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff would n't free care encourage people to run to the doctor for every ache and pain people who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospital about a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical bills still canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor 's -- have a lower per-person health bill than we do it is `` free '' in that there are no deductibles nor copayments two things which i advocate to make the canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is i know that when working in alberta ontario and quebec i was aware that i was paying for health insurance e.g. in toronto ohip fees were listed on my pay stub manitoba did not collect at paycheque time but only annually at income tax time built into the tax rate only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it 's free along with the canadian left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda the french do have copayments though france magazine 's summer edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage including a sample chart of copayment percentages for 1-30 days you 're covered for of the public hospital rate afterward with extra private insurance you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate the public insurance covers beyond days or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance over 2/3rds of french have some form of extra private insurance so the other of health costs in europe are out of private funds not gleaned from other taxes the gdp figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14 figure for the u.s. is n't the private health insurance industry just too big and powerful to kill dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be '' politically thorny '' in the quiet words of one advocate for a national plan some 1,200 firms now sell more than billion in health insurance they 'd put up a hard fight not only has the industry grown eightfold since canada shut down its own health insurers but our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does canada 's parliamentary system health insurance does exist in canada and in western europe its just that it does n't cover basic care you can opt out in canada and germany but you 'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so -- i.e. no market when private insurance realized how much money they 'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance e.g. neurosurgery versus deluxe amenities e.g. having to call granada tv to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone 's private hospital room they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility in quebec last spring a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan gld --

utkvm1.utk.edu veal utkvm1.utk.edu david veal writes if the senate was less powerful than the house of lords than we 'd almost have to state that the house of representatives was also in fact they both were because the british government had much greater power than did the american system in principle no in practice yes in principle no that they had less power of that they should have had less power the british parliament in principle has absolute power so does the monarch much of the stability of the system rests on what is not defined clearly in the case of a clear abuse by one side or the other the other side can act to remedy the situation two institutions with absolute power cute let 's talk practicality shall we if the monarch tried to do something what would happen if they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current '' no state subsidy motto '' they would be better placed as it is there is plenty of state money being handed out the problem is that it is distributed on the basis of power in congress and not on the basis of actual need bingo the higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters because political power can be concentrated at higher levels while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness that was not my point but you illustrated the problem very well in order to set up a school project in new york state you have to pay off the other states with pork defense contracts agricultural subsidies etc or to be precise of the states since you need to beat the filibuster then why not simply leave new york 's education to new york i remain unconcinved that there is any state in the union which is not capable of educating its own children if that 's what they want to do the point is of redistribution of cash from the poor areas of the ecconomy to the rich ones i am contending that there is no state in the union which does not have ample wealth if they choose to spend it to run a perfectly acceptable education system i further contend that the amount of money being spent now is more then sufficient but is being spent badly or vice versa if you are n't a republican so tell me phill were the republicans also responsible for some of the huge increases in social programs or were they only responsible for what you do n't like i contend it is congress which is to blame democrat and republican alike if society simply writes off any areas of the country that is ecconomically weak you end up with a basket case ecconomy there are inevitable cycles in any business some of these act in phase to produce the `` business cycle '' others are countercyclic localities can experience boom to bust cycles outside the national trend to produce a strong ecconomy you need to ensure that the bust areas do not fall bellow the level where they can not be ecconomically rebuilt most of our worst areas are still better off than most of europe in any case we 're talking about education if the industry in an area collapses the us as a whole still has a responsibility to ensure that the children in that area get a good education in some areas of the us schools are closing halfway through the year for lack of money yes i live in once such area you 're woefully ignorant of the situation at the same time some of tennessee 's school districts are closing down the governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial celebration license plats in almost the same breath he wanted to raise unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it i do n't know about the rest of the country but our education problems stem directly from two problems neither of which are a lack of money in the state btw tennessee is considered a `` tax heaven '' and our economy is one of the strongest in the country i see a correlation what money we spend goes primarly to administration the average administrator makes two and a half times what the average teacher makes and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue and the governor is making a concerted effort to create an `` education crisis '' in order to push for his pet income tax some of the most idiotic programs get funded like state funds for new art in the county seat while schools are closing it 's not a lack of funds it 's an unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate education is the parental hot-button education is always the first to but cut because it 's easier to get people to pay for their children than ugly art the u.s. constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document the delcaration of independence was the high-brow reasoning there are a couple of other examples though such as the reasoning for the power to tax and the reasoning for the power to grant permits both in article i section the declaration on independence cam a decade earlier and has not a line of justification for the us constitution you could argue that it went into the broad concepts but little more it spoke very eloquently on government being based on the consent of the governed in fact it is little more than a protracted whinge more to do with the price of tea than the design of a government it would be a pretty daft idea for a bunch of guys to sit arround designing the structure of the new government while the little matter of the british army remained to be settled they did it anyway the continental congress had its own set of bylaws it was n't quite a government but a means of making decisions had to be created however low george washington 's opinion of them were to a certain extend i do believe the veto has become something it was n't intended however i also believe it is inevitable considering the congress own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say unlike most people i think we should n't be worrying about the veto which is fine but of the problem in congress which almost necessitates its abuse the congress is the most democratic body in the whole system allow me again to speak heresy against the holy democratic orders so what the government was built with a very non-democratic presidency with fairly broad powers including the veto it has not only the fairest system of election but the two year term means that the members have always got a recent mandate yes and the senate was intended to act as a balance to this too much democracy was intentionally avoided it was considered a good thing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action on the other hand if the period of election were to be made years in antiphase to the presidential cycle there would be much less dependence on fund raising from special interests than there is at present so long as congress has something to sell people will pay for it most congressmen rake in more money than they need why not what is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action historically governemnt action in the u.s. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful when you 're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority in other words david thinks that the reactionaries should need only votes while progressives should need no if the `` progressives '' do n't want the `` reactionaries '' to move backward they get the same benefit of the states is a lot of people and historically laws with that sort of minority arent' very effective especially since it is usually geographically concentrated when wielding the federal big stick i do n't see why they shouldn't have to make a better argument than `` more people than not '' agree now we know why nobody calls the republicans democrats i 'm not a republican i 'm a republican and no i 'm neither a democrat nor a democrat now i 've asked several times and all you 've done is answer '' it is n't democratic '' which i knew before i said it why should it be

______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april remarks by the president secretary of education richard riley and secretary of labor robert reich in goals satellite town hall meeting chamber of commerce building washington d.c. 8:30 p.m. edt secretary riley good evening and welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of april you know today is april 13th in thomas jefferson was born years ago i think that 's appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been of course a person who has been one that we 've all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country the success of our democracy according to jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system his philosophy of government his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening tonight we 're so pleased to have with us president clinton he 's come over from the white house to join us in the chamber of commerce studios mr. president it 's good to have you we thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening also we have with us secretary of labor robert reich and bob it 's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also i have some questions for our two guests and i 'm sure many of you do too so please call us if there 's something that you 'd like to ask the number is 1/800/368-5781 or in washington d.c. the number is 202/463-3170 or i believe the president has a few words that he might want to share with us and mr. president i 'll ask you to do that at this time it 's great to have you the president thank you very much mr. secretary i 'm glad to be here with my friends dick riley and bob reich -- also members of my cabinet -- at the headquarters of the chamber of commerce to support the effort that the chamber is making along with its center for work force preparation to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place i want to compliment the chamber on all their efforts recognizing that without an educated work force we ca n't grow this economy or remain competitive and recognizing that we all have to work together -- business and government labor and educators -- to make things happen this satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together and if you 'll forgive me a little home state pride i want to say a special word of thanks to the wal-mart corporation headquartered in bentonville arkansas for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight i appreciate that a lot as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you i have tried as hard as i could to move toward constructive change for this country secretary riley talked about this being thomas jefferson 's 250th birthday if thomas jefferson believed in anything he believed in these three things first in education second in real personal liberty freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of association freedom of the press and third in the absolute imperative of changing as times change if you go to the jefferson memorial here in this beautiful city which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms you will see jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times for us here in america that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world we 're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better unless we do that none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government even to bring the budget into balance even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs will last in the long run we also have to have people who can carry their load and in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime it 's not just important what you know but what you can learn and if i might i 'd like to close just by emphasizing we 're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the labor department and the education department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition and we 're trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time dick i think i ought to stop there that 's a good place we can begin i think the discussion secretary riley thank you so much mr. president each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals and tonight we 'll focus on goal five and how communities such as yours can prepare students for this world of work this week the education department and the labor department are hosting a conference here in washington d.c. called summer challenge a program of work and learning to america 's youth the aim is to use some special funds from president clinton 's proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country mr. president let 's talk a minute -- you alluded to it somewhat -- about the summer youth challenge your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs and why in your words is that so important the president i think it 's important for two reasons first of all a lot of the young people we 're trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning and while we want them to have a good experience with a real job we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime and that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before secondly we want to help these young people progress not only in terms of work but in terms of learning we want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners and we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school or at work or in college as they go on secretary riley well i think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids -- that gap that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year is really even greater secretary reich of course you have training programs throughout the year and i wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training secretary reich well what we 've learned mr. secretary is that for many young people whether it 's for the summer or for the year actually on-the-job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning many young people for example have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning geometry but when they actually are there building something or working on something and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry they understand what it 's used for and a lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly terribly important it 's important during the summer but it 's important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer secretary riley thank you mr. president you 've called for a youth apprenticeship program school-to-work transition and i wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing the president well first of all let 's talk about why it 's important most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four-year college degree but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma if you look at the last years the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade the young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade because they were n't productive they were n't more valuable to their employers so we think america has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but do n't go on to college make a transition to work which includes two years of further training either in a community college a vocational setting or perhaps on the job and what i have done in this budget as you know is to give you and secretary reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community based on the needs of the economy in any given area it could revolutionize long-term the quality of the american work force and the earnings of american workers secretary reich i should add mr. president -- i think you know this from your experience in arkansas -- and many of the people watching this program -- that the business community and educators labor groups are already in many of our communities many of our states building a school-to-work transition program in fact there 's an awful lot of ferment a lot of excitement the people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that and more power to them secretary riley and i are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there secretary riley bob we 're going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep the co-op learning career academies and what features all those programs that deal with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of these school-to-work programs might have that are important secretary reich well one thing that we 've seen -- and you and i have been working at this for a long time and you much longer than i -- we 've seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential and i 'm so delighted that we 're doing this in the headquarters of the chamber of commerce the chamber of commerce of the united states is committed to doing these kinds of programs -- training education retraining -- and we 've aimed to work very closely with the chamber the business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators community colleges technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future communities have got to come together i mean this is one of the most important things you 've got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together you know too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here labor groups over here and everybody is talking but they 're not really working together in a common strategy and the third and final ingredient i would say dick would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence this is not a tracking program we 're talking about for kids who are not going to make it this is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for if they want to go on beyond that to four-year college that 's fine that ought to be permissible but we 're talking about the foundation of learning about jobs the foundation skills for on-the-job learning and again those are the critical components it 's already being done the president i think -- if i might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home -- the business community has a critical role to play not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here 's what ought to be taught but also in monitoring that excellence if you have the right sort of partnership there the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them so i think that 's very important and when we try to if you will fill in the blanks at the federal level trying to set some standards and provide some funds one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs because that 's really what 's going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile secretary riley that 's great we 've been talking of course about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall but let 's talk just a moment about long-term school reform it 's something especially close to me mr. president i wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on goals legislation that i think will be coming forth before too long the president well as you know back when you and i were both governors we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize i had a hand in writing the national education goals that the governors drafted along with representatives of president bush 's administration back in and what we 're going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners too meet those goals -- making sure that when -- by people show up for school ready to learn that we get a percent on-time high school graduation rate that children at the 4th 8th and 12th grades are confident in the subjects they 're supposed to know that they are second to none in math and science that are schools are safe disciplined and drug-free and of course the fifth goal -- i took them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of life-long learning in this country and each one of those goals there 's a national role a state role a school role school district role and a private sector role and what you 've attempted to do in this bill you 're going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is and then to give the rest of america a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we 're actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet it 's very exciting so far as i know nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job i 'm really excited about it secretary riley well i am too and i think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts all driven by high standards that 's the point bob let me ask you one question and then we 'll get to the telephone calls it 's about the same subject we have of course skills standards that are going to be part of goals and i wonder if you would comment on that secretary reich well you know we have percent of our young people who do n't graduate from college very often they do n't have very many alternatives they do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs everybody does n't have to go to college other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical preprofessional skills we can do it in this country if you do n't go to four-year college you 're not a loser and we want to develop those national skill standards we 're going to be working with the states with the education department with a lot of private industry in developing those standards and i think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around as well as our business community secretary riley well that 's great why do n't we go ahead and go to the telephone we have a call i see -- mayor bruce todd of austin texas q yes mr. president and mr. secretary reich and riley we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today we have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative let me simply say amen to some of the comments made already we agree with much of the tone that the clinton administration has taken and are very supportive we have been successful here in austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years we expect to have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime perhaps as much as 3,500 with the federal assistance much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments so we must be thinking alike but the question essentially involved what initiatives after labor day would be appropriate we know summertime is important year-round is even more important and what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis and perhaps more importantly how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative that 's something that we believe is very important to success in this effort secretary riley mr. president the president i think i 'll give everybody a chance to answer the question bruce but let me first thank you for calling and thank you for all the great work that you 're doing in austin i 've seen some of it and i 've always been very impressed first with regard to the summer program we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector too we hope that -- secretary reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer and we 're working on that secondly in the program that i have presented to the congress over the next five years what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that 's quite substantial for job training programs for school-to-work programs all of which give heavy heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year-round basis and i will say again to echo what secretary reich said a moment ago to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning an awful lot of young people actually have quite high iqs but actually learn so much better when they 're doing than when they 're reading or just listening so we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent and we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have budget cuts and more than actually in the budget -- and some revenue raisers and some new money for education and training that we 'll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question bob do you want to say anything secretary reich well you took most of the words out of my mouth mr. president as usual but let me just add one thing and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college in addition to the school-to-work program simply is the availability of jobs and we 've got to get this economy moving again obviously it 's terribly important to get this recovery program to get the economy back on track that 's sort of the prerequisite to everything else if we do n't get the economy back on track -- we have -- i think this is the 16th -- correct me if i 'm wrong mr. president -- i think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater this is a jobless recovery a lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in june and even if we did everything right they would have a very very hard time getting jobs secretary riley thank you both of course goals will be a permanent long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year it will involve if passed -- and we certainly hope it will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways and then the state with all the various school districts a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement and i think everybody will see a great energy out there once we get that moving the next call is dr. harry heinemann new york doctor q good evening mr. secretary it is a pleasure to be on with you this evening as you may know bridging the school and work has been central to la guardia 's educational program since its inception in the 1970s and that includes the college the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus and the linkages we have forged with the local schools we have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy and over the years we 've come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work and these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace with providing all students early exposure to careers as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills and lastly the critical role of the liberal arts particularly in the development of high performance competencies my question then is how can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience and what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration secretary riley well thank you very much i think -- and we 'll get a response from you all on that and very interesting work going on there we 're going to have three people our next guests on the program this evening that will be some specialists in that area that you 're speaking and i 'll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later you all care to comment -- any comments you might have the president i 'd just like to say if i might one thing i want to reemphasize this and i do n't think i 'm being as clear about it as i 'd like although i think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than i. i think this whole concept of applied academics is very important and i think that we have to basically abolish what i consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning i think we should keep the liberal arts going i think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program secretary reich it seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students they 're important for all students it 's not just a special group of students that needs them some of the experiments that i 've seen around the united states -- dick i 'm sure you 've seen them as well -- are mainstream experiments they 're mainstreaming all the students at 11th and 12th grades they 're giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program and again the kids can either go on to college if they want they can go on to technical community they can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and career directions but we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom within our schools secretary riley thank you very much i think that 's going to be the last call that we have time for mr. president i think you 've got to move on to another matter and i want to thank you and secretary reich for being here we appreciate your time and your ideas and it 's been a tremendous help to us end9:00 p.m. edt"

gary l dare writes ... i heard about a guy in alberta who came down with some rare eye disease that he had to take repeated trips to seattle to get treated well what american private insurance plans cover travel expenses well it was n't just the travel expenses it was the whole treatment when you buy insurance where you live it is based on the local rates tourists coming from say utah will find that there is a difference in what their insurance will cover fob provo and what they get stuck with at lenox hill or mount sinai if they fall ill in the big apple but to what extent does it affect the system and why is an urgent care list necessary in the first place it 's worth thinking about it 's regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get at what facilities do n't americans have to arrange in advance for operations too i think that there are two standards being applied here and that canada ca n't give beverly hills-style treatment to everybody it 's not a big brother list ... it 's more like calling around town for a table for dinner ... but americans need far less advance time to book operations it would depend on where you live downtown toronto or mile british columbia just like cheyenne wy vs. boston ma again geography rears its ugly head since our health care providers are private they depend on an adequate market size in order to sustain enough business since our health care professionals have equivalent take-home pay to their american cousins it 's not that they 're being paid too little to provide services whether canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own health services catering toward americans who would be willing to pay more than they do is another issue entirely it must be noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants from the province were getting smaller if those grants are so insubstantial why the need to attract foreigners to make up the difference you answered the question yourself ... `` private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow '' and i think that it 's about time that they acted like the private hospitals that they are personally i 'm fed up with canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance that 's one at you bob rae true but i was thinking ... does/can anybody compete with the provinces to offer basic health coverage i remember reading that that sort of private health insurance is actually illegal in canada i have only hear americans say that it 's illegal ... but i could be wrong just have never heard it from a canadian source our private insurance has recently balked in quebec when the liberals proposed privatizing some aspects of routine care ... also our insurance was put in place when no ndp labour governments were in power in any province to derail the effort 'cos they wanted real socialized medicine you 're not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one insurance plan no it is optional ... as it is optional for doctors to accept it there are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for exemptions and one e-mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verified for me that it is indeed negative option i guess that you can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance but so far i 've not come across that up north ... and i take pains to keep tabs with news from home and that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an effective cartel-they do n't really need to compete because as you put it they 're in a `` win-win '' situation and they 're guaranteed to turn a profit believe me they probably had orgasms when they figured that out and according to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to the point of ungraciousness at chamber of commerce luncheons interesting side note-have any new insurance companies started up-from scratch-since medicare became standard in canada i actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since ww i ... no scratch that ... there are a few in western canada and quite a few in quebec as part of the post-1980 quebec miracle out with the nationalism in with the french capitalism la groupe des cooper- antes built a new tower by the eaton 's store at les terraces and if you were able to catch urban angel on cbs 's crimetime you 'd see it as the well-lit one with double-turrets at the top as for ontario which still dominates and anchors business up north ... canada is a very old-money kind of place and the free trade agreement saw a lot of odd alliances labour unions and establishment old money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one side and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and professionals on the other the final trudeau administration and the first mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux riches who knew what it was like to make your own money and that motivated the mcdonald commission under trudeau which set up brian's initiative macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count of his caucus after the election it 's not really insurance if you do n't have alternatives well you have to realize that in our society that 's like saying that `` it 's not really national defence '' because you ca n't hire your own rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist btw there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their portion of taxes but never people arguing over health insurance alternatives ... and we 're talking about a press that is hostile to whomever is in government regardless of party one of their few redeeming characteristics it seems also in the april globe and mail there was a letter from the director of trauma services at st. michael 's hospital in toronto responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in california and canada in which some canadian doctor worried that american analysts would seize on the results as proof that canada rationed vital services the doctor i ca n't recall his name said that canada is rationing vital services `` as any physician can plainly see '' he said that a system in which people are refused treatment because they ca n't afford it is no different from a system in which people are refused treatment because the government can't afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health insurance plan in fairness he did say that both the us and canadian systems are in the same situation the only way to hit at the canadian system is transient periods of high demand which is more a function of the doctors monopoly 's tight fist on the licencing an obvious difference is that in such a transient period the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling over cabbage patch dolls^tm as we 've seen recently as opposed by rationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a transient situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the california health infrastructure the same would result -- rationing among the insured population with smaller markets there is much less flexibility when dealing with our insured population than california which by the way has 1/3rd more people than canada in a much more dense area so he is correct in that the resources are fixed for a particular time window or as a function of the doctors monopoly licencing according to the market steady state in either case as for being `` refused treatment '' the government of the day would be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen canadians can be geographically bad too not realizing that their health care is private while only their insurance is n't ... too many people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized medicine i know i know the monopoly power of canadian doctors often leads them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more money from the government another case of businessmen once scratched becoming socialists right as i 've pointed out above ... but has n't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place to the other it has n't really solved it either way the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp in the light of disasters e.g. chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart disease a doctor needs 4-6 years of training plus internship and specialty training people too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their insurance when they really do n't need to that 's why i 've argued for deductible and copayments rather than education which is what most canadian fiscal conservatives are arguing for the leftists `` ah just let 'em spend '' -- yeah right also note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions under some high dollar threshold ... in most it 's your private insurance that covers it just like in the u.s still it all adds up in the oecd measures in fact buffalo may be the only place in the us where people get don cherry jokes we get the sabres feed as a replacement game on espn tonight the devils local metro ny coverage supplants the main espn game the ndp cleaning up a tory spending mess and just when i thought i understood canadian politics yeah it 's a sad story and saskatchewan tory leader grant devine has been on a nonstop pr campaign to save his sorry butt the sask ndp have taken a neo-conservative turn like hawke gonzalez and mitterand did has anybody considered following singapore 's example and going to a system where the company and the state buys basic and catastrophic coverage for everybody and then you also have an ira sort of thing to which you and your employer can can contribute for medical expenses only it would tend to discourage you from overusing it the medical ira would have limited use as you 'd need a lower catastrophic threshold else there 'd still be a drain on the public purse if someone exhausts their ira also singapore has a much more autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses if singaporeans that i 've met are any indication ... i don't mean any disprespect here where they 'd let you just die one of the good things about being the last country to create a national health care system should we decide to is that we have everybody else 's mistakes to learn from that 's true ... the question is how much leeway is there between the u.s. approach and the second-most capitalist approaches of canada france and germany seriously there are few areas that have sufficient population for a two/more-tiered system like what the french have ... a health policy prof d.g shea has cited studies in the nejm that indicate having a population of 500,000 is necessary for adequate competition ... and in canada there are only four cities west of the great lakes with that population or larger but there are many cities in the us with that kind of population yes many ... and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too far from a bigger town just take a look at a detailed atlas ... or better take a flight from pittsburgh or rochester to toronto my first time across lake ontario to nyc i was amazed by the increase in density ... and the toronto region is the densest in all of canada there was one about a group of doctors in calgary who have opened canada 's first us-style mri clinic as an alternative to the provincially owned one it 's about time i 've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they do n't invest in their own private practices ... in the end it 's their money but they choose to spend it on america 's cup pipedreams and that 's none of my business as for `` provincially owned '' ... for sure it 's against the law in canada for governments to be directly involved in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser- vations what that term actually means is that the facility gets by on public grants to meet shortfall from lack of use ... no kidding medical practice itself is much more conservative up north my own best friend did two clerkships at the mayo clinic in rochester mn and is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first there were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of two-tiered health care and that it might violate the canada health act no it 's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have private practices ... and always have they can all take cash anyways ... so why not have a particular facility the canadian big government mentality often imagines government where it does not even exist ... since the french and germans have become more entrepreneurial and less laidback without sacrificing their culture and values then canadians can do the same as i 've pointed out above the law states that it is illegal for the government to provide any health services except for the military and natives look nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the mri ... nobody stopped them when they bought it nobody seems to be stopping them from using it either much ado about nothing thank goodness that hockey playoffs have started ... while it seemed currently unjustified there was one anecdote told by the head of the partnership to demonstrate the mri he showed an image of an injured knee which happened to belong to the manager of the bank who approved the loan he said that without it the guy might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial mri then another length of time for treatment after which the muscles would have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder if that is n't the first whiff of two tiers i do n't know what is i 'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere because the gao study of canada cited often on usenet did not find access to mri to be a problem i 'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened to american trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit there are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without relying on mri ... unfortunately i 've had a few and i 'm not a

dscomsa.desy.de hallam dscomsa.desy.de phill hallam-baker writes in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered children and ordered the suicide/murder of his other followers according to the account given the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the koresh/gun supporter claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up if the aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns for all practical purposes they were unarmed the b-d followers had automatic weapons ... the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this is simply rationalisation it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through i must object to the characterization of those opposed to the government 's handling of the waco situation as `` gun supporters '' your argument tries to paint the batf critics as right-wing gun nuts and just mixes up two issues i am one of the batf/fbi critics and yet i am a liberal and just as anti-gun as you are i just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights even religious crazies they 're all human beings not some nest of wasps that you 're trying to exterminate the batf created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original raid it was well known that koresh regularly went jogging outside his property he could have been served with a search warrant then he could have been arrested if he had refused to comply instead officers armed with grenades invaded the property this escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both sides those were the first two mistakes the bad judgment of asking for a no-knock warrant and the bad and probably illegal way the already-unwise warrant was served at this point the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis that 's when the government started covering their traces sealing the warrant revising their reported history of the incident etc things were already building up to disaster now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and waited but according to janet reno that option had `` never been seriously considered '' so supposedly because the agents were `` frustrated and fatigued '' and because there supposedly were no backups they felt they had to go in yes the govt handled it in the rambo hollywood type style with extreeme machismo perhaps thats not the way to handle it it is a completely different thing to start asserting as many have done that the government is primarily to blame the comparisons with the nazis in particular are purely gratuitous since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your post desreves to be taken seriously peter nelson also made some very good points about how a low key approach might have been more effective the point is though that you learn through mistakes the govt played the wrong card and lost thats not a big deal they had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they just were not prepared for wuite this situation who could be if the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps be able to castigate the govt if they used the same tactics and failed in the same way as it is i ca n't say that i would not have made the same mistake maybee i would n't because i do n't as a rule go in for a confrontational situation if i can avoid it maybee i would because with all those press about its very difficult not to try the macho stuff the fbi had information from within the compound we had no access to they may have calculated that the b-d followers resolve was cracking based on their listening devices within the compound they knew that koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt this may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have been a weapon for breaking his resolve again in panama they had used the heavy rock music to great effect during bush 's invasion funny that few of the koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the death of several thousand pananmanian civilians while the us govt attempted to arrest their former ally and please let 's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun discussion anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government agents and koresh 's civil rights exist whether his guns were legal illegal illegal-but-should-have-been-legal or whatever koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired on the police helicopter no matter whether the warrant was or was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out thought that it was thus the assault on them was completely inexcusable no matter

19, document_id from pa146008 utkvm1.utk.edu david veal subject re re fillibuster in article c5jpl7.5cz dscomsa.desy.de hallam dscomsa.desy.de phill hallam-baker writes in article 1993apr12.002302.5262 martha.utcc.utk.edu pa146008 utkvm1.utk.edu david veal writes come to that under the original plan there was n't meant to be anything much for the federal government to do except keep the british out that 's also untrue but at least we 're wandering a little closer toward reality that the articles of confederation fell apart is enough proof it was there for just a tad bit more well yes and no the federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what maddison etc were up to from them there are a couple of ways to look at them one is `` we want you to support this constitution so we 'll say anything that we think will appeal to you '' or the more straightforward `` this is why we think what we 've suggested in this constitution is a good idea '' you clearly consider the former to be the primary situation they certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position well i know hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist and probably the authoritarian extreme to jefferson 's democratic impules but what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we do n't consider what they wrote about the government and is writing in support of something automatically `` propoganda '' to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what they do n't believe and like the house of lords which it is copied from it was given pretty wide powers unfortunately they started to use them and thus the gridlock set in i was n't aware the house of lords had `` wide powers '' i was under the impression is was pretty powerless compared to the house of commons and certainly did n't have almost equal their powers the senate is restricted only that it may not introduce bills relating to raising revenue the senate was less powerful than the house of lords in the period in question if the senate was less powerful than the house of lords than we 'd almost have to state that the house of representatives was also in fact they both were because the british government had much greater power than did the american system my reading of the constitution and other writings gives me absolutely no reason to believe the senate was n't intended to make use of their law-making powers in fact grid-lock appears to have been designed into the system with the senate being a more deliberative body to act as a check on the more-often elected house the system is meant to be slow to react the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow i disagree the system is not too slow it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle as somebody in washington put it whose name i forget `` congress has become everybody 's city council '' congress is more than capable of quick action and has more than enough power and time on its hands if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy it is not a case of the system of government they created failing but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid namely a concentration of power it would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either house in some attempt to grease the wheels all you 'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things it would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level on what basis do you suggest that the senate was supposed to be some sort of rubber-stamp for the house you 'll note that while the president 's veto may be over-ridden the house ca n't do anything about a `` veto '' by the senate the preside n't veto was meant to be entirely separate until bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation please explain to me how bush abused the veto in an `` extraordinary '' manner the veto was clearly regarded as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive i fail to see where any restrictions implied or otherwise were placed on the veto it could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise in the executive's opinion policies there is no limit in the constitution to the president 's veto power regarding what a bill is for previous presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons most usually having something to do with their agenda i am really curious how you single bush out as the president who abused vetos the senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body it is meant as a check on unrestrained legislation that is the extra measure built into the constitution in favour of the status quo of the representatives of the states is not a reasonable restriction why is it not a reasonable restriction because senators is the magic holy number upon which laws must be based if senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster is n't that enough to indicate there 's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it why one earth should be sufficient to enact a law which covers million people in very very diverse places and living in radically different conditions why should n't a super-majority be required any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority will be ignored i do not see this as a positive thing and for all that i 'm sure the republicans are looking for pork as much as the democrats they 've got some legitimate objections to the legislation in question -- -- -- -- --

know what phill really means because he 's obviously using arguments designed to convince i make no secret of what i am up to i have stated explicitly in posts that i am a political propagandist on numerous occasions anyone posting to this group who is not probably has the wrong group for example i have on numerous occasions stated quite clearly that i beleive that certain factions of the gun lobby are the worst possible advocates of their cause and i am prepared to do anything in my power to provide them with a platform because they can convince people far better than i could hope that many people with a fixation on lethal weapons are dangerous and derranged if you happen to know a political position which does not have people advocating it who do more harm than good please point it out some people have even accused me of inventing such advocates purely for the purpose of having them trash a set of political views in fact this would be a futile tactic because i could never hope to invent a character as dangerous as sybok.athena.edu a man who i quite seriously believe to be mentaly ill and a potential psychopath unfortunately the local sherifs office have informed me that they are unable to act untill he attacks someone one of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof on the part of the government before they may take action against citizens and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should be available so if you were to ask me what is the point that i am trying to make from this current argument on the absolute sanctity of the us constitution what would i answer we are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the u.s. constitution in fact the fillibuster we 're talking about isn't in the constitution i objected to your suggestion that the senate was n't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given firstly i see that the current us political scene like the uk political scene has become tied to special interests rather than chase the convenient caricatures put about by the media and polititians themselves for this gay rights cmapaigners environmentalists zionists i.e jews `` foreign lobbyists '' whatever voting power they have etc i sugest that you look at who is really benefiting the inevitable conclusion is that it is the major corporations owned by the ultra-wealthy that have benefited regan and bush created what can only be described as a welfare state for the rich i 'll point out again that reagan only had a republican majority in the senate during his first term and his coalition in the house came apart at about the same time bush never had any real support in congress the real point is that everybody everywhere got their pork from the big corporations to the guy i saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk-food he 'd bought with food stamps he spent more in food stamps on junk than i make in a week and i 'm not on government assitance money was diverted from programs addressing social needs and poured into the weapons industry in the form of cost plus profits contracts lessee let 's pull out the old almanac in total u.s. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion dollars in est they were 1.4754 trillion dollars an increase of approx billion dollars in national defense cost 133.9 billion dollars in it was billion dollars and increase of billion dollars that leaves an increase of billion dollars unaccounted for this represented an increase of in income security which includes retirement programs housing assitance and unemployment benefits and i believe welfare cost 86.5 billion dollars in it was billion dollars or more than national defense started this represented an increase of in the federal government spent billion dollars on medicare in they spent billion dollars an increase of in the feds spent billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like in it was billion in health care services and research was billion dollars in it was billion dollars agriculture up billion to billion science up billion to billion resource conservation up billion to billion education up billion to billion veteran benefits up billion to billion trasnportation up billion to billion about the only things i see which was seriously decreased was under the energy category primarily under `` supply '' and `` community development '' in the area of `` disaster relief '' and between the two of them represent a loss of less than billion dollars where was this huge diversion in order to rectify this situation there must be constitutional revision not that 's a stretch if the current government was pushed by the president to create this mess would n't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone secondly the form of this revision must take account of the changed circumsatnces of the role of the federal government only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue i see very little positive about it the constitution can not be used to frustrate the democratic process the constitution was designed to frustrate the democratic process so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened nor do i see putting the brakes on the `` democratic process '' an inherently bad thing califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse if the peoplr want to have welfare spending by the federal government they will have it sometimes or perhaps most of the time the people should be told `` no '' and pointed to their local government attempting to prevent this through constitutional trickery only leads to the constitution being brought into disrepute phill would you do me the very great favor of repeating that in talk.politics.guns methods will always be found to bypass such provisions and once the government gets used to bypassing those provisions they will bypass the others up to the first ammendment cute we can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating the law this is a major reason why the right to own guns should be excluded the implication that this right is equal to the right to free speech is dangerous free speech alone is dangerous phill people know that mass ownership of lethal weapons causes thousands of murders a year the dangerous conclusion they may reach is that the first ammendment may also be the same dangerous mistake ok phill all you got ta show me is a clear pattern of reduction in homicide rates across several countries and that'll be it not current mind you reduction note however that this is not the slippery slope argument it is because the right freedom of speech has been chained to the privilege to own weaponry that the danger arises the advocates of this pivilege must not be allowed to chain freedom of speech to their cause such that if they fall freedom of speech falls as well such actions are not the actions of people genuinely interested in freedom who 's chaining anything to freedom of speech by calling it a freedom thirdly and most importantly i want to discover a mechanism wherby i can engender intellectual debate as opposed to totemic debate i consider the grave threat to civilisation to be the loss of the ability to reason about the political debate at anything other than the superficial level the objection i raise to your basing your case entirely on the assertion of the supremacy of the us constitution is that the currency of your argument is limited to the currency of the totem upon which it is based the danger of totems is that they can be reinterpreted in different ways by different people phill you 're a master of subtly changing the subject i haven't based my argument against raw democracy on the constitution i've tried to explain why it is n't a good idea the only time i 've referred to the constitution is to point out it does n't contain the restrictions on the veto and the senate you appear to believe were `` meant '' but just did n't make it in there the constitution does n't contain the fillibuster rule i only believe that the rule is a good idea you c n't dismiss that as

could install grass on a macintosh which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for satellite data grass is public-domain and can run on a high-end pc under unix it is raster-based has some image-processing capability and can display vector data but analysis must be done in the raster environment i have used grass v.3 on a sun workstation and found it easy to use it is best of

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- intergraph based in huntsville alabama sells a wide range of gis software/hardware microstation is a base graphics package that imager sits on top of imager is basically an image processing package with a heavy gis/remote sensing flavor feature description basic geometry manipulations flip mirror rotate generalized affine rectification affine 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th order models as well as a projective model warp an image to a vector map or to another image rgb to ihs and ihs to rgb conversion principal component analysis classification k-means and isodata fourier xforms forward filtering and reverse filters high pass low pass edge enhancing median generic complex histogram/contrast control layer controller manages up to images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a band image or create color images by combining various individual bands etc the package is designed for a remote sensing application it can handle very large images and there is all kinds of other software available for gis applications host configuration requirements it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci -- a company called pci inc. out of richmond hill ontario canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different `` industry standard '' formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms-dos unix workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the `` pci software '' consists of several classes/groups/packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common `` pci database '' disk file the `` tape i/o '' package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape formats into or write those formats out from the `` pci database '' file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci-supported third-party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer e.g an epson-type dot-matrix graphics printer you might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo- gram and fourier analysis equalization user-specified operations e.g `` multiply channel by add channel and store as channel '' and god only knows what all else -- there 's a lot i do n't have and don't use these so ca n't say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application/interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight `` parameters '' read from a common `` parameter file '' which must be in vms anyway in your `` default directory '' some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm-pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility executions in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure there's also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from/write to the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r-s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance the tape i/o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi-band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls `` raw '' data from tape in a number of different `` interleave '' orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic-arts industry 's `` ct2t '' format would probably i have n't tried handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you 're doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it 's worth noting that the pci `` database '' file is designed to contain not only `` raster '' image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land-use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote-sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci `` database '' i _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third-party display systems the name gould/deanza seems to come to mind one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci `` database '' file to a peritek vct-q q-bus 24-bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be `` overkill '' in your case it seems designed for the very `` high end '' applications/users i.e those for whom a mac/pc largely does n't suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time it's probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which does a lot of its land/resource management via remote sensing i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas spam spectral analysis manager -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- back in jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis manager which got a fair amount of use at the time that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data pixels across by lines by bands a modified version has since been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer which uses much larger images spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement stretching spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering the original spam uses x or sunview to

jay-peg '' is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of `` natural '' real-world scenes it does not work so well on non-realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black-and-white 1-bit-per-pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is `` lossy '' meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details are n't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine-analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you do n't mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a mbyte full-color file down to kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software does n't support jpeg directly you 'll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg-capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time/space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it 's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information bits/pixel million colors instead of or less or fewer colors if you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though 8-bit gif will look as obsolete as black-and-white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full-color or gray-scale images of `` realistic '' scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you do n't have 24-bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg ca n't squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single-color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small-size overlaid text do n't jpeg it computer-drawn images ray-traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi-realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black-and-white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray-scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray-scale images of up to levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full-color original if you start from a gif you 've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you 'll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 6b file size in bytes comments ship.ppm original file in ppm format no compression bits or bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship.ppm.z ppm file passed through unix compress compress does n't accomplish a lot you 'll note other text-oriented compressors give similar results ship.gif converted to gif with ppmquant -fs ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves bits/pixel not see sec ship.jpg95 cjpeg -q highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship.jpg75 cjpeg -q default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on-screen at once ship.jpg50 cjpeg -q this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it 's been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship.jpg25 cjpeg -q jpeg 's characteristic `` blockiness '' becomes apparent at this setting djpeg -blocksmooth helps some still i 've seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship.jpg5o cjpeg -q -optimize -optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 in this case jpeg can make a file that 's a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the -q file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full-color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes what are good `` quality '' settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings `` quality '' does not mean `` keep of the information '' as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it 's not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting -q is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try -q first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above -q saying -q will produce a file two or three times as large as -q but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to -q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default -q is about right for compressing 24-bit images but -q to is usually better for converting gifs see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a -q setting in the range of to is about right -q or so may be amusing as `` op art '' note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs do n't even provide a numeric scale just '' high '' '' medium '' '' low '' -style choices where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you do n't know how to use ftp see the faq article `` how to find sources '' if you do n't have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article that article appears regularly in news.answers or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server rtfm.mit.edu with '' send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources '' in the body the `` anonymous ftp list faq '' may also be helpful -- it 's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answers archive 6a if you are looking for `` canned '' software viewers etc the first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you do n't see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows john bradley 's free xv version 2.00 and up is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats it 's available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu the file is called 'xv- .tar.z where is the version number currently 2.21 it is located in the 'contrib directory on export or the 'pub/xv directory at upenn xv reduces all images to bits internally which means it 's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display you 'll still get only 8-bit color also you should n't use xv to convert full-color images to jpeg because they 'll get color-quantized first but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other 8-bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier be sure to check the `` save at normal size '' checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy 's free imagemagick package also available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/imagemagick.tar.z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1 the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays ms-dos this covers plain dos for windows or os/2 programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel 's free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version 2.4a is available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca 129.97.50.50 file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either or 386/486 machines the user interface is not flashy but it 's functional another freeware jpeg/gif/tga viewer is mohammad rezaei 's hiview the current version 1.2 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip hiview requires a or better cpu and a vcpi-compatible memory manager qemm386 and 386max work windows and os/2 do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there 's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier-looking although personally i find it harder to use -- more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is 2.1 available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you do n't have one look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built-in vesa driver so do n't try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i do n't know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time the well-known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision 8.60a however cshow 's jpeg implementation is n't very good it 's slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays too bad ... it 'd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you ca n't get any of them to work you 'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi-color hardware do n't use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa-capable viewer instead vpic5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays the independent jpeg group 's free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip or jpeg4386.zip if you have a and extended memory these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 6b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools gif2jpg/jpg2gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you ca n't get 24-bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi 's proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet-standard jfif format since hsi-format files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability version 2.0 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware get it from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on non-pc platforms handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note below file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip note about simtel20 the internet 's key archive site for pc-related programs is simtel20 full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil 192.88.110.20 simtel20 runs a non-unix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg `` msdos/graphics '' at simtel20 that really means '' pd1 msdos.graphics '' if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20 there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel20 archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead a popular usa mirror site is oak.oakland.edu 141.210.10.117 which keeps simtel20 files in eg `` /pub/msdos/graphics '' if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel20 by e-mail see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is microsoft windows there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip requires windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode this is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway at least for previewing ... jview is freeware fairly fast has good on-line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it ca n't create new jpeg files and it does n't view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it's an excellent basic viewer the current version 0.9 is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu 129.79.20.84 file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive.wustl.edu winjpeg shareware displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow the current version is 2.1 available from simtel20 and mirror sites see note above file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip this is a slow 286-compatible version if you register you 'll get the 386-only version which is roughly faster colorview is another shareware entry this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version is 0.97 available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in full-screen mode not in a window os/2 the following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu 128.123.35.151 note check /pub/uploads for more recent versions -- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free ijg conversion programs version /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit

0.84 jpeg/gif/bmp viewer gif viewing very fast jpeg viewing fast if you have huge amounts of ram otherwise about the same speed as the above programs strong 24-bit display support shareware macintosh most mac jpeg programs rely on apple 's jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a or better cpu and you need to be running system 6.0.7 or later if you 're running system you must also install the 32-bit quickdraw extension this is built-in on system you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx as of 11/92 this file contains quicktime 1.5 which is better than qt 1.0 in several ways with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 1.5 mac users should keep in mind that quicktime 's jpeg format pict/jpeg is not the same as the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format see section for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict/jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version 2.0 is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu 36.44.0.6 file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx requires system and quicktime on 8-bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it's the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some do n't overall jpegview 's user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware image viewer/converter supports jfif and pict/jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is 2.3.2 get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx requires system 6.0.5 or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg/gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it 's faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v0.6 a jpeg gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple 's free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats you can get pictpixie from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer 's tool and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it 's even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology 's picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer/converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need 32-bit quickdraw so really old machines can't use it you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run 32-bit quickdraw a mac

the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you 'd like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join what 's all this hoopla about color quantization most people do n't have full-color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full-color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called `` color quantization '' this is something of a misnomer `` color selection '' would be a better term we 're stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full-color format converting a color jpeg image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg 's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets `` smeared '' into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output incidentally because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as `` 256-color jpeg '' this tells me that the poster a has n't read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray-scale just like photographs but number of colors just is n't a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format does n't allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients do n't have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you 're stuck with the sender's quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re-quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image furthermore if the sender did n't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm you 're out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines do n't match the sender 's display hardware jpeg 's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user 's display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you 're stuck forevermore with what was sent it 's also worth mentioning that many gif-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it's also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones finally an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already 15-bit `` hi-color '' pc displays true 24-bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it can not represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all-around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine-independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article 's long enough already so i 'm not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp.compression faq this is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part 1-3 if you need help in using the news.answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there 's a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i.e. one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying `` -q '' to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v4 free jpeg code you can also say '' -sample 1x1 '' to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations can not cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum-loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we ca n't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to '' do their own thing '' and as a result their programs are n't compatible with anybody else 's the closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format is some work that 's been coordinated by people at c-cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg-based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a `` low-end '' format that transports pixels and not much else tiff/jpeg aka tiff 6.0 an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a `` high-end '' format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it 's not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg-related products it 's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff/jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported `` lowest common denominator '' tiff/jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple 's quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif-compatible format wrapped inside the mac-specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 6a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software 's programs gif2jpg/jpg2gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non-hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the -j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi-format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non-pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wo n't read it 's likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg-based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif-standard file will start with the characters hex ff d8 ff e0 followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by 'jfif if you see ff d8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a `` raw jpeg '' file this is probably decodable as-is by jfif software -- it 's worth a try anyway hsi files start with 'hsi1 you 're out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they wo n't decompress properly with non-hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg-compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for 'jfif strip off everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it anything else it 's a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d8 try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is '' begin '' line m_ c_x ... whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with '' begin '' line m '-i ... if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different `` back end '' modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file-size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you can not legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the `` fair use '' doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings is n't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i.e. you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation if you 're wondering why it 's because the pixel-block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that 's a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full-color data the gif was made from it 's far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon-type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors do n't convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high-visual-quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation do n't waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don't expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through jpeg files would be i.e. shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts `` ghost '' edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv 's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg 's default q setting of is appropriate for full-color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually `` dithered '' to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise and jpeg ca n't compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to `` smooth '' the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you 'd get without smoothing with the v4 free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try `` -smooth '' or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high-quality gifs heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you do n't want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg 's built-in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol ... the upshot of all this is that `` cjpeg -quality -smooth '' is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you 'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the

p0.f18.n104.z1.fidonet.org bill carlson writes since everywhere i look zoroaster is suggested as being a probable descendant of daniel suppose you prove he was n't ref encyclopedia of religion mircea eliade magi sneak preview later still eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeo-christian religions as can be seen in the famous _oracles of hystaspes_ a work whose iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the christian era probably the second century ce widengren the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant was the basis for the story of the coming of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ 2:1-12 the old persian word magu rendered in greek by magos is of uncertain etymology it may originally have meant `` member of the tribe '' as in the avestan compound mogu-tbish `` hostile to a member of the tribe '' this meaning would have been further resticted among the medes to `` member of the priestly tribe '' and perhaps to `` priest '' benveniste boyce the term is probably of median origin given that herodotus mentions the `` magoi '' as one of the six tribes of the medes for a variety of reasons we can consider the magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of median origin in western iran among the persians they were responsible for liturgical functions as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult most likely the supremacy of the median priesthood in western iran became established during the time of the median monarchy that dominated the persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century bce until the revolt of cyrus the great bce the persians were indebted to the medes for their political and civil institutions as well even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period boyce we must still maintain that they were of median origin this is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of gaumata the magian mentioned by darius i 522-486 bce in the inscription at bisutun iran as well as by greek sources indeed herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the medes against the persians through the conspiracy of the magi the fact that the magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions this seems to be attested by the elamite tablets at persepolis there is a theses put forth by giuseppe messina that denies that the magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood a priesthood of purely zoroastrian origin this thesis is untenable on the other hand the hypothesis that their name is related to the avestan term magavan derived from the gathic maga vedic magha `` gift '' is not without foundation mole the meaning of maga can probably be found in conformity with the pahlavi tradition within the context of the concept of purity or separation of the `` mixture '' of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter the maga which has been erroneously interpreted as `` chorus '' from the root mangh which is said to mean `` sing the magic song '' nyberg and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision in any case though there may be a relation between the old persian term magu and the avestan terms magavan and maga we must maintain a clear distinction between the magi and the avestan priesthood the avesta ignores the median or old persian term despite a recent hypothesis proposed by h.w bailey old persian inscriptions ignore the avestan term for `` priest '' athravan vedic athravan even if this is perhaps present in an achaeminid setting in the elamite tablets of persepolis gershevitch the term magu has been present in zoroastrianism throughout its history the pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation the latter in particular derives from an older form magupati `` head of the magi '' during the sasanid period third to seventh centuries ce which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church the title mobadan mobad `` the high priest of high priests '' came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy the magi practiced consanguineous marriage or khvaetvadatha av pahl. khwedodah they also performed a characteristic funeral rite the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it the corpse was not supposed to decompose lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction this practice later became typical of the entire zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in iran and among the parsis in india stone towers known as dakhmas were built especially for this rite during the time of herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the magi the persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax then buried it the practice was widespread however among the peoples of central asia the magi were the technicians of and experts on worship it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a magus during the performance of a ritual sacrifice the magus sang of the theogony the magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the avesta and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future the magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful or `` ahrimanical '' animals khrafstra such as snakes and ants they dressed in the median style wearing pants tunics and coats with sleeves they wore a characteristic head covering of felt gr tiara with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath boyce the color of these caps in conformity with a tradition that is probably of indo-european origin according to georges dumezil was that of the priesthood white in all likelihood during the achaemenid period the magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine and it is probable that they gradually adopted zoroastrianism they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism nonetheless they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of zorastrian traditions by virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes the wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the `` magic of zarathushtra son of horomazes '' and thus the `` cult of the gods '' magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just courageous and master of himself during the achaemenid period the magi maintained a position of great influence although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of gaumata the magian in which according to herodotus who calls himself smerdis the persians killed a large number of magi to avenge the usurpation the magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in media in persia and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the persian civilian and military administration no priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the magi they were renowned as followers of zarathushtra zoroaster as the teachers of some of the greatest greek thinkers pythagoras democritus plato as the wise men who arrived guided by a star at the manger of the newborn savior in bethlehem and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in india but they were also known as the chaldeans the priesthood of babylon known for its occultism this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in greek like `` goes '' `` expert in the magic arts '' bidez and cumont indeed the chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts especially astrology and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge to understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views it is necessary to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the so-called western magi who were later hellenized in the achaemenid period both must have been at least in part zoroastrian but the western magi those of the iranian diaspora in asia minor syria mesopotamia and armenia who came in contact with diverse religious traditions must have sooner or later and in varying degrees been influenced by syncretic concepts the greeks were familiar with both kinds of magi and depending on their varying concerns would emphasize one or the other aspect of them classical historians and geographers including herodotus and strabo document their customs while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines dualism belief in the hereafter magian cosmology and cosmogony and their theology and eschatology those sources most interested in the doctrines of the magi even speak of zarathushtra as a magus in doing so they are repeating what the magi themselves said from the median and achaemenid periods when they adopted zoroastrianism at that time they embraced zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die it has been said quite often in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the magi in the zoroastrian tradition that the vendidad from vi-daevo-data `` the law-abjuring daivas '' part of the avesta should be attributed to them this collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices nonetheless the hypothesis is hardly plausible since the first chapter of the vendidad a list of sixteen lands created by ahura mazda the supreme god of zoroastrianism but contaminated by an attack by ahriman pahl gathic-avestan angra mainyu the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering does not mention western iran persia or media the land of ragha mentioned in the text can not be median raghiana furthermore it has been noted gershevitch that if the authors had been magi the absence of any reference to western iranian institutions including their own priesthood would be very strange the magi were above all the means by which the zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the avesta have been transmitted to us from the second half of the first millennium bce on this has been their principal merit we can attribute directly to the magi the new formulation that iranian dualism assumed known to us especially from greek sources and in part from the pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries ce according to this formulation the two poles of the dualism are no longer as in the gathas spenta mainyu `` beneficent spirit '' and angra mainyu `` hostile spirit '' but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu gershevitch see ahura mazda and angra mainyu this trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religious world in this new dualism which was that later known to the greeks aristotle eudemus of rhodes theopompus and others we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within zoroastrianism to which we give the name zurvanism see zurvanism thanks to their adherence to zoroastrianism the magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of zarathushtra 's treachings as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the iranian diaspora the greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them xanthus of lydia hermodorus aristotle theopompus hermippus dinon even writing treatises on the persian religion of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived in the hellenistic period the magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom and writings on magic astrology and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as zarathushtra ostanes and hystaspes forming an abundant apocryphal literature bidez and cumont later still eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeo-christian religions as can be seen in the famous _oracles of hystaspes_ a work whose iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the christian era probably the second century ce widengren the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant was the basis for the story of the coming of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ 2:1-12 see saoshyant the sasanid period saw the magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of iran concerned to win back the western magi de menasce and eager to consolidate zoroastrianism as the national religion of iran the priests of iranian sanctuaries in media and persia were able to establish a true state church strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures the leading figures in the development of a state religion and of zoroastrian orthodoxy were tosar and kerder the persecutors of mani in the third century saoshyant the avestan term saoshyant `` future benefactor '' mpers. soshans designates the savior of the world who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind the concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of zoro- astrianism together with that of dualism it appears as early as in the gathas zarathushtra zoroaster as the prophet of the religion is himself a sao- shyant one who performs his works for the frashokereti the end of the present state of the world when existence will be `` rehabilitated '' and `` made splendid '' see frashokereti later zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological myth and expanded the number of saoshyants from one to three all the saviors are born from the seed of zarathushtra which is preserved through the ages in lake kansaoya identified with present-day lake helmand in seistan iran protected by 99,999 fravashis or guardian spirits the greatest of the awaited saoshyants the victorious astvatereta `` he who embodies truth '' the son of the vispataurvairi `` she who conquers all '' is the third who will make existence splendid he appears in yashts upon his arrival humankind will no longer be subject to old age death or corruption and will be granted unlimited power at that time the dead will be resurrected and the living will be immortal and indestructable brandishing the weapon with which he kills the powerful enemies of the world of truth that is the world of the spirit and of asha astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and render it imperishable he and his comrades will engage in a great battle with the forces of evil which will be destroyed the name astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation kellens as are those of his two brothers ukhshyatereta `` he who makes truth grow '' and ukhshyatnemah `` he who makes reverence grow '' the names of the three virgins yashts who are impregnated with the seed of zarathushtra when they bathe in lake kansaoya and give birth to the saoshyants are equally speculative each of these saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a millennium initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind the doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the archaemenid period sixth to fourth century bce it was not perhaps the principal element in the formation of the messianic idea but it was certainly a determining factor one that enjoyed great success in the hellenistic period beyond the confines of the iranian world a similar concept that of the future buddha maitreya was most likely indebted to it and christian messianism can trace its roots to the same source"

20, document_id from brian lpl.arizona.edu brian ceccarelli 602/621-9615 subject re is it good that jesus died in article bskendigc5rbvn.aai netcom.com bskendig netcom.com brian kendig writes and i maintain some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters because they fear it they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own terms and so by their own choice they will remain in darkness sort of like bugs under a rock however some people but not many will not like the darkness sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable these people will crawl out from under the rock and although blinded at first will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth and after a while now that they can see things for what they really are they will also see the heights which they can reach and the places they can go and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes are you your own master do you have any habits that you can not break for one you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the bible seems that ignorance has you mastered how about sexual sins got ta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of do you dehumanize women when they walk past you do you degrade them to a sex object in your head are you the master of that kind of thinking do you insult people unknowingly then regret it later yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself are you truly the master of yourself i have admitted that i am not the master of my thought life at all times that i sometimes say things i do want to say and then repeat my mistake unwantingly i have admitted to myself that i can not control every aspect of my being there are times i know i should n't say something but then say it anyway there are times i simply forget a lesson i in fact am not my own master i need help jesus promised me this help and i took him up on his offer i have willfully let jesus be my master because jesus knows what is better for me than i myself do and why not does not the creator know his creation better than the creation does toyota know what 's better for the corolla than the corolla do you see my point i think you 're the one under the rock and i'm getting a great tan out here in the sunlight my life has improved immesurably since i abandoned theism -- come and join me it will be a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscles for the long hike but it 's well worth it then i guess ignorance is bliss for you because brian you enjoy not having a clue about the bible do n't you see i 'm not going to accept anything that i ca n't witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses especially not something as mega-powerful as what you 're trying to get me to accept surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good reason to do n't you can you witness motherly love with your senses how does caring and concern for you register with your senses if nothing registers to you other than what you can see taste smell hear and touch then you better become a vulcan and fast you better get rid of your emotions and i do have a good reason to believe what i do when did i say that i say that i would rather cease existing instead of being subject to the whims of a deity but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who i am then so be it the topic was about my god and your lack of knowledge about what my god says my god says that you will not cease existing you have life forever you can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever or can choose to live it in paradise with god that is what my god says and that was the issue your made-up theism is what it is -- made up it's wishful thinking nope -- most people are christian most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect of believing that the world is an undesirable place of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again of doing just as their priests tell them like good little sheep you enjoy darkness and you 're proud of it is this the religion of kendigianism most people are not christian most people including christians are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect is `` the world an undesireable place '' a doctrine of kendigianism it has nothing to do with my god does kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship mine does n't does kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again mine does n't does kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep mine does n't is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being ignorant of the bible brian following christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of kendigianism you would find any of your doctrines in the bible i do n't follow kendigianism i follow christ also to try to again show you your ignorance of christ and the bible in regards to `` priests '' have you not read about the sole melchizedek priest in hebrews and have you not read what the purpose is of the old testament levitical priesthood and why there should not be priests today yes guess what the catholics messed up i do not follow catholicism or any `` ism '' i follow christ nope you make decisions enjoy your successes and accept your failures then you die if you are content with the life you 've led as you reflect back on it in your final moments then you 've led a good life why would you want to live a good life to you you die and that 's it do n't contradict yourself you have no reason to live a good life it does n't do you any good in the end your life does n't do anybody else any good either because everyone dies anyway so you have no reason to lead a good life leading a good life is meaningless why do you do such a meaningless thing i 'm sorry i do n't feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god i 'd worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case it 's not really all that important has the resurrection sunk in jesus is alive jesus is not dead jesus was sacrified to fufill the old testament sacrificial system in its every detail jesus 's death was like a seed he needed to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root did you miss the entire john passage as well forget the bible for a minute forget quoting verses forget about who said what about this or that show me picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop and convince me that you 're right forget that i am a person forget that i know how to type forget that i know how to put a sentence together forget that i know how to send e-mail forget my existence proove to me that i exist be honest

20," document_id from pharvey quack.kfu.com paul harvey subject daniel v. zoroaster was the jewish discomfort with jesus in article 1746.2bd37a66 paranet.fidonet.org bill.carlson p0.f18.n104.z1.fidonet.org bill carlson writes since everywhere i look zoroaster is suggested as being a probable descendant of daniel suppose you prove he was n't zoroaster is far older than daniel if anything one could claim that in a sense daniel is a descendant of zoroaster as daniel though being hebrew has assimilated into zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the tanakh of judaism however the majority of the book is in hellenistic aramaic not babylonian aramaic and only has kethuvim or writing status ref encyclopedia of religion mircea eliade daniel or in hebrew daniyye l hero of the biblical book that bears his name daniel is presented as a jew in the babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion 's pit he also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of israel's restoration to national-religious autonomy as a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court described in daniel 1-6 written in the third person daniel per- forms his interpretations alone while as a visionary-apocalyptist in daniel 7-12 written in the first person he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future it is likely that the name daniel is pseudonymous a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition ez 14:4,28:3 the authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in hebrew whereas daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in aramaic the language division parallels the subject division daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations 7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies the overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances daniel 2-7 is chiliastically related suggest an attempt at redactional unity after the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion a chronological ordering is discernable a sequence from king nebuchadrezzar to darius is reported dn 7-12 much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic for example daniel speaks of nebuchadrezzar 's transformation into a beast a story that is reported in the qumran scrolls of nabonidus belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of babylon although he was never king and darius is called a mede who conquered babylon and is placed before cyrus ii of persia although no such darius is known the medes followed the persians and darius is the name of several persian kings presumably the episodes of daniel 2-6 depicting a series of monarchical reversals episodes of ritual observances and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the seleucid period late fourth to mid-second century bce in order to reinvigorate waning jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith the visions of daniel 7-12 reporting events from the reign of belshazzar to that of cyrus ii but actually predicting the overthrow of seleucid rule in palestine were collected and published during the reign of antiochus iv prior to the maccabean revolt for it was then beginning in bce that the jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to judaism and their ancestral traditions and many refused to desecrate the statues of moses and endured a martyr 's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion all of the visions of daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways for example via images of the enthronement of a god of judgment with a `` son of man '' invested with rule this figure was interpreted by jews as michael the archangel and by christians as christ in chapter via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations as in chapter or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies especially those of jeremiah 25:9-11 as found in daniel 9-12 the imagery of the four beasts in chapter paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin is one of the enduring images of the book it sur- vived as a prototype of jewish and christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the middle ages the role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete isaac abravanel the scientist isaac newton and the philosopher jean bodin and among the fifth monarchy men of seventeenth century england for example is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups the schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent the encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of isaiah 52:13-53:12 regarding the suffering servant of god not as all israel but as the select faithful neither the opening stories about daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt they rather advocate a stance of piety civil disobedience and trustful resignation victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel michael and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto-pharisaic group of hasidim or pietists the themes of resistance to oppression freedom of worship preservation of monotheistic integrity the overthrow of historical dominions and the acknowledgement of the god of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour zarathushtra founder of the religion know as zoroastrianism or mazdaism from mazda or ahura mazda the name of the god prophesied by zarathushtra the etymology and history of zarathushtra the avestan and oldest form of the name as uncertain both in various iranian languages and in related forms else- where there may have been an old persian form zara-ushtra from which the greek form zoroastres may be derived and there may have existed an old iranian form zarat-ushtra to which may be linked the middle iranian zrdrwsht several middle persian forms such as zrtwsht and the new persian zardusht we can state with certainty only that the second half of the name ushtra means `` camel '' the form zoroaster derived from the greek zoroastres was used traditionally in european culture until the eighteenth century when zarathustra closer to the original and as found in nietzsche came into common use after the rediscovery of the avesta the collection of sacred books of zoroastrianism and the resulting studies in iranian philology see avesta notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of zarathushtra even in western culture the sources available to us are few extremely fragmented and heterogeneous our principle sources are the five gathas `` songs '' attributed to zarathushtra himself and included in the yasna section of the avesta gatha ahunavaiti yasna 28-34 gatha ushtavaiti yasna 43-46 gatha spentamainyu yasna 47-50 gatha vokukhshathra yasna and gatha vashishtoishti yasna the last of which was probably written after the prophet 's death other sources of considerable albeit varying importance are the younger avesta and the remaining zoroastrian religious literature in particular the pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures ce although the achaemenid inscriptions sixth to fourth centures bce never mention zarathushtra he is mentioned by some greek sources of the time not however by herodotus who seems unaware of him the avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of zarathushtra but the text is useful in an indirect way as it clearly implies that the environment in which zoroastrianism arose was not that of iran under the medes or the persians the greek sources on the other hand do provide some information concerning the time of zarathushtra although from a historical point of view they are unreliable some place him six thousand years before the trojan war xanthus of lydia eudoxus of cnidus hermippus hermodorus aristotle plutarch diogenes laertius and pliny the account by xanthus of lydia however has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred rather than six thousand years before the expedition of xerxes against greece this interpretation is favored by diogenes laertius who makes reference to xanthus but although a few scholars a. s. shabazi helmut humbach have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts it is generally rejected although the historical value of the greek sources is negligible they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in iran by the achaemenid period as the above account would seem to demonstrate they also show that by this time zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure one from an extremely distant past all of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with or even close to that of the achaemenids later zoroastrian sources the pahlavi texts do provide an absolute chrono- logy for zarathushtra one that was also accepted by some arab authors accord- ing to these sources zarathushtra lived or years before alexander again scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification the most convincing arguments however seem to support the latter position the figure of years is accurate only on the surface because it represents in fact the more general one of which was employed by sasanid propagandists to locate zarathushtra 's lifetime roughly around the beginning of iranian domination for a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the iranian chronology there was also a desire on the part of the sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat in this context zarathushtra whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos converted vishtaspa at the age of forty-two and vishtaspa 's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium thus explaining the double date of and years before alexander given the unreliability of the few available sources we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements principally on the contention that zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before cyrus the great cambyses and darius as there is no mention in the avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western iran in the middle of the first millennium bce nor is there any mention of the history of that period which was to lead iran to a position of such predominance at the same time for a number of reasons going back much further in history would not be justified consequently the traditionally accepted theory of placing zara- thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium bce appears to be the most legitimate as to zarathushtra 's land of origin many scholars agree on the basis of valid arguments that he must have come from eastern iran some have held that he was a mede largely because of a late iranian tradition linking zarathushtra with azerbaijan but also because of linguistic reasons based on the language of the avesta this hypothesis however should be discarded as we can suppose both on historical and linguistic grounds that zarathushtra came from the east even though we do not know precisely from which region there is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter including the improbable view that he came from chorasmia or present-day khorezm or from a wider chorasmian region reaching as far as the oases of merv and herat most likely however zarathushtra 's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the hindu kush mountain range to the more southern regions of bactria and arachosia modern qandahar as well as drangiana the area of lake helmand it would thus be located in what is now afghanistan or in the border regions of iran zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste yasna 33.6 he was a zaotar cf sanskrit hotr that is a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry even in the so-called younger avesta he is described as an athravan yashts 13.94 a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste to enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training which he used to lend dignity as in the gathas to the contents of his new message the product of a great and original ethical mind zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition linking india to iran in another way by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan or `` possessor of asha '' that is the one who as in the vedic rtavan seeks truth and masters it thus becoming ashavan in this life almost an initiate and blessed after death any good follower of such teachings seeks the `` vision of asha '' just as those chosing the right path in vedic india aspired to the '' vision of the sun '' a manifestation of rta behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of `` aryan mysticism '' that is of indo-iranian mysticism zarathushtra 's greatness however does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition rather it lies in the innovation and strength of his message which was in itself a break in the tradition one that force- fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas dualistic monotheism the wise lord who fathers two twin spirits the beneficent and the evil and the expectation of a transfiguration av. frashokereti pahl. frashgird of life and existence see frashokereti both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate zarathushtra 's teachings from the indo-iranian tradi- tions of his upbringing they exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil because of his basic tenets zarathushtra who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi- tion can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures another original facet of zarathushtra 's message one that is not easy to understand but which however holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the gathas is the doctrine of the amesha spentas the `` beneficent immortals '' these are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought best truth desirable power bounteous devotion wholeness and immortality all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue see amesha spentas other than the names of his father pourushaspa `` possessing gray horses '' and of his mother dughdova `` one who has milked '' we know almost nothing of zarathushtra 's life a late pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers according to tradition zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty and at thirty he was subject to a revelation both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision only after ten years had passed however did he succeed in converting a cousin of his maidhyoimah to his beliefs he was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis karapans and usijs priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices this hostility caused him to leave his region yasna 46:1 and to seek refuge at the court of kavi vishtaspa a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife hutaosa when the prophet according to tradition was forty-two years old we also know the name of a son isat vastra `` desiring pastures '' and of three daughters born of his first wife as well as the names of two more sons urvatatnara `` commanding men '' and hvarecithra `` sun-faced '' born of his second wife hvovi a member of the influential hvogva `` possessing good cattle '' family two other figures belonging to the hvogva family are mentioned frashaoshtra and jamaspa the former as hvovi 's father and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet pouruchista `` very thoughtful '' whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the gathas yasna again according to tradition zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven he was assassinated by a karapan a priest of the old religion who belonged to the tuirya tribe and was called tur i bradres his name is known only in the pahlavi form the paucity of information on the prophet 's life is compensated by a tradi- tion rich in legendary detail that arose through the centuries in zoroastrian communities the main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the denkard a pahlavi work dating from the ninth century ce as well as passages from other pahlavi texts and a new persian work from the thirteenth century the zarathusht-nama book of zarathushtra written by zaratusht-i bahram-i pazhdu mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about zarathushtra which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man zarathushtra 's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the renaissance until the enlightenment during the classical and hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man a typical representative of an `` alien wisdom '' a master of the secrets of heaven and earth a seer astrologer psychologist and wonder worker pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of zarathushtra on pythagoras himself and the academicians always openly admired the persian thinker who founded the school of the magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism earliest christianity viewed zarathushtra as a precursor of the christian faith one who not only prophesied as had the biblical prophets the advent of the messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming the star that was to appear in the east and guide the three magi to the manger in bethlehem see magi this christian interpretation is derived from the zoroastrian doctrine of the saoshyant the savior of the future see saoshyant later however religious struggles arose during the sasanid empire in persia third to seventh centuries ce which linked the spread of christianity with the roman empire zarathushtra 's popularity in the christian world began to decline the iranian prophet who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by mani as one of the three great messengers from the past was now seen instead as a leader of imposture and heresy a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery but during the renaiss- ance and the enlightenment european cultures reverted to the image of zara- thushtra that had come down through classical and hellenistic antiquity he was viewed once again as a great and wise man as the author of the _chaldean oracles_ and probably inventor of qabbalah as a teacher of astrology as a possible bridge between christianity and platonism and at times as in voltaire as a symbol of non-christian wisdom after western philology rediscovered zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries friedrich nietzsche in an intentional paradox gave the name zarathustra to the hero of his work _also sprach zarathustra_ 1883- nietzsche saw the iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things that is the

20," document_id from kilroy gboro.rowan.edu dr nancy 's sweetie subject re food for thought on tyre there has been a lot of discussion about tyre in sum ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt as there are a lot of people living there it would appear that ezekiel was not literally correct this does n't bother me at all because i understand the language ezekiel used differently than do so-called biblical literalists for example it sometimes happens that someone says `` my grandson is the cutest baby '' and then turns around and sees the granddaughter and says `` oh is n't she the cutest thing '' this person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for first rather he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented because this example is one that is common to many people nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements the bible however is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true for those people the existence of tyre is a problem for me it is not turning to the latest person trying to defend ezekiel we read this from john e king the prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the area no it implies nothing of the kind if you had nothing but the prophecy from ezekiel and you were told you interpret it literally you would never say '' oh he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff like that '' you would read `` i will make you a bare rock '' and `` you will never be rebuilt '' and you 'd conclude that tyre would be a bare rock the only way to get from fishing nets to houses and buildings and a medium-large population is if you know that all that latter stuff is there in other words your answer means that ezekiel misled everybody who read the prophecy at the time it was written there is no way that given a literal reading they could read this passage and conclude `` medium-size city '' you seem to feel that `` never be rebuilt '' means `` be rebuilt '' -- maybe so but it is hardly a clear implication mr king also writes so far i 've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000 let 's assume the latter one is correct by modern standards we are talking about a one-horse town well no that 's only a bit less than the population of annapolis where i'm from you know the naval acadamy the state capital george washington resigned his commission in the statehouse annapolis may not be new york but it 's at least a two-horse town but supposing 22,000 people is a `` small town '' -- it 's still 22,000 people more than ezekiel predicted and you 've said nothing about the other problem in chapter ezekiel predicts that nebuchadnezzar will will destroy tyre and loot all their valuables however nebuchadnezzar did not destroy tyre and in chapter ezekiel even quotes god as saying `` he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against tyre '' let 's ignore alexander for a moment and just pay attention to chapter ezekiel says n. would destroy tyre and n. did not destroy tyre ezekiel says that n. would plunder their valuables but n. did not plunder their valuables regardless of what you think about tyre _now_ the fact is that n. died before the place was destroyed ezekiel said n. was going to do it and n. did not this post is of course pointless inerrantists have an amazing ability to rewrite the bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say for example i expect mr king to respond to the comments about ezekiel by pulling some `` clear implications '' out of hat when ezekiel said that n. would `` demolish your towers '' that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers used to be and when ezekiel said that n. would `` demolish your fine houses and throw your stones timber and rubble into the sea '' that clearly implied that n. would never set foot on the island and when ezekiel wrote that n. would `` build a ramp up to your walls '' that clearly implies that n. would spend years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the walls see a few `` clear implications '' that are totally contrary to the text and you can reconcile anything you want darren f provine kilroy gboro.rowan.edu '' do you know why i 'm the enabler because you demand it '' -- cliff claven"

20, document_id from trajan cwis.unomaha.edu stephen mcintyre subject theists and objectivity can a theist be truly objective can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning i 've often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wondering about god and his scriptures i've seen it in the christian the jew the muslim and the other theists alike all assume that their mothers and fathers were right in the aspect that a god exists and with that belief search for their god occasionally the theist may switch religions or aspects of the same religion but overall the majority keep to the belief that some `` creator '' was behind the universe 's existence i've known muslims who were once christians and vice versa i 've known christians who were once jewish and vice versa and i 've even known christians who become hindu yet throughout their transition from one faith to another they 've kept this belief in some form of higher `` being '' why it usually all has to do with how the child is brought up from the time he is born the theist is brought up with the notion of the `` truth '' of some kind of scripture -- the bible the torah the qur'an etc he is told of this wondrous god who wrote or inspired the scripture of the prophets talked about in the scripture of the miracles performed etc he is also told that to question this as children are apt to do is a sin a crime against god and to lose belief in the scrip- ture 's truth is to damn one 's soul to hell thus by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself the belief in its `` truth '' is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course but it does n't stop there once the child is able to read for himself there is an endeavor to inculcate the child the `` right '' readings of scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant readings to gloss over the worse ones and to explain away the unexplainable with `` mystery '' circular arguments `` self-evdent '' facts and `` truths '' unreasoning belief and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of every day to doubt of course means wrath of some sort and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concerns god all of this has some considerable effect on the child so that when he becomes an adult the superstitions he 's been taught are nearly impossible to remove all of this leads me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when questioning god hell heaven the angels souls and all of the rest can he for a moment put aside this notion that god does exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view obviously most theists can somewhat especially when presented with `` mythical gods '' homeric roman egyptian etc. but can they put aside the assumption of god 's existence and question it impartially stephen _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ atheist _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ libertarian _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ pro-individuality _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ pro-responsibility _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ jr. and all that jazz ... --
20, document_id from rcanders nyx.cs.du.edu mr. nice guy subject no-knock was re who 's next mormons and jews isaackuo skippy.berkeley.edu isaac kuo states in reply to deleted article about no-knock searches arrests hmm the police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn clearly marked as officers and yelling `` police '' repeatedly this is used every day to bust drug houses the idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight as for not knocking it 's a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight usually this strategy works if it did n't then it would n't be used so commonly now would it in general no-knock raids are to preserve evidence like drugs which can be flushed down the toilet they are not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber if there is no need to search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and order the suspect to come out with her hands up if the suspect does not come out tear gas will be used comment on the bd omitted i merely point out that it is a valid strategy which is used every day furthermore we do n't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects do you suggest it is not a method to apprehend criminals that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers 's badges just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects how far can they reasonably go to identity themselves what do you suggest they can do which ca n't be faked by the '' competition '' it is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way it is the most dangerous way to arrest anyone the cops are charging into a room and they do n't know what is in it it is much safer to surround the place and announce yourself even if you 've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops that's not an excuse to murder police in the case of the bd 's there was almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops cops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works if they are arrested they call their lawyer post bail and hope for a plea bargain if they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid drug dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other criminals not to shoot cops cops are shot on no-knock drug raids because the criminals are n't aware that they are cops no-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to end in disaster mom and pop citizen _know_ that they have not committed any crime they know that anyone breaking into their house can not be a cop because they have done nothing wrong if they have the means to defend themselves they may because they know that the housebreakers are criminals not cops cops and homeowners may die the first reports from waco stated that the atf had a warrant to search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapons were found in this case the no-knock warrant was not called for it is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet the atf could have surrounded the compound a marked police car could have driven up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and served the warrant usual way it this had happened and and koresh refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of the t.p.g folks would have kept quiet -- rod anderson n0nzo `` i do not think the united states government boulder co is responsible for the fact that a bunch of rcanders nyx.cs.du.edu fanatics decided to kill themselves '' satellite n0nzo on ao-16 slick willie the compassionate

20, document_id from mcelwre cnsvax.uwec.edu subject the divine masters the divine masters most christians would agree and correctly so that jesus christ was a divine master and a projection of god into the physical world god incarnate but there are some very important related facts that christians are completely ignorant of as are followers of most other world religions first jesus christ was not unique john 3:16 notwith- standing there is always at least one such divine master god incarnate physically alive in this world at all times a continuous succession throughout history both before and after the life of jesus the followers of some of these masters founded the world 's major religions usually perverting the teachings of their master in the process christians for example added threats of `` eternal damnation '' in hell and deleted the teaching of reincarnation secondly and more importantly after a particular master physically dies and leaves this world there is nothing that he can do for anybody except for the relatively few people that he initiated while he was still physically alive that is simply the way god set things up in the universes therefore all those christians who worship jesus and pray to jesus and expect jesus to return and save them from their sins are only kidding themselves and have allowed themselves to be duped by a religion that was mostly manufactured by the romans and emotional `` feelings '' are a totally deceiving indicator for religious validity these things are similarly true for followers of most other major world religions including islam thirdly the primary function of each master is to tune his initiates into the `` audible life stream '' or `` sound current '' referred to as `` the word '' in john 1:1-5 and as `` the river of life '' in revelation 22:1 and to personally guide each of them thru the upper levels of heaven while they are still connected to their living physical bodies by a `` silver cord '' true salvation which completes a soul 's cycles of reincarnation in the physical and psychic planes is achieved only by reaching at least the `` soul plane '' which is five levels or universes above the physical universe and this can not be done without the help of a physically-living divine master one such divine master alive today is an american sri harold klemp the living `` eck '' master or `` mahanta '' for the `` eckankar '' organization now headquartered in minneapolis p.o box zip another divine master is maharaj gurinder singh ji now living in punjab india and is associated with the `` sant mat '' organization one of the classic books on this subject is `` the path of the masters '' radha soami books p.o box gardena ca written in by dr. julian johnson a theologian and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in india studying under and closely observing the sant mat master of that time maharaj sawan singh ji several of the eckankar books including some authored by sri paul twitchell or sri harold klemp can be found in most public and university libraries and some book stores or obtained thru inter-library loan the book `` eckankar -- the key to secret worlds '' by sri paul twitchell is another classic many christians are likely to confuse the masters with the `` anti-christ '' which is or was to be a temporary world dictator during the so-called `` last days '' but the masters do n't ever rule even when asked or expected to do so as jesus was people who continue following christianity islam or other orthodox religions with a physically-dead master will continue on their cycles of reincarnation between the psychic planes and this miserable physical world until they finally accept initiation from a physically-living divine master re-incarnation the book `` here and hereafter '' by ruth montgomery describes several kinds of evidence supporting reincarnation as a fact of life including hypnotic regressions to past lives about accurate the subconscious mind sometimes makes things up especially with a bad hypnotist spontaneous recall especially by young children some of whom can identify their most recent previous relatives homes possessions etc dream recall of past life experi- ences deja vu familiarity with a far off land while travel- ing there for the first time on vacation the psychic read- ings of the late edgar cayce and even supporting statements from the christian bible including matthew 17:11-13 john the baptist was the reincarnation of elias and john 9:1-2 how can a person possibly sin before he is born unless he lived before always use the `` king james version '' later versions are per-versions strong interests innate talents strong phobias etc. typically originate from a person 's past lives for example a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having drowned at the end of a previous life and sometimes a person will take an immediate dislike to another person being met for the first time in this life because of a bad encounter with him during a previous incarnation the teaching of reincarnation also includes the law of karma galatians 6:7 revelation 13:10 etc. people would behave much better toward each other if they knew that their actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the future or in a future incarnation `` 2nd comings '' if a divine master physically dies `` translates '' before a particular initiate of his does then when that initiate physically dies `` translates '' the master will meet him on the astral level and take him directly to the soul plane this is the one and only correct meaning of a 2nd coming it is an individual experience not something that happens for everyone all at once people who are still waiting for jesus `` 2nd coming '' are waiting in vain planes of existence the physical universe is the lowest of at least a dozen major levels of existence above the physical plane is the astral plane the causal plane the mental plane the etheric plane often counted as the upper part of the mental plane the soul plane and several higher spiritual planes the soul plane is the first true heaven counting upward from the physical the planes between but not including the physical and soul planes are called the psychic planes it is likely that esp telepathy astrological influences radionic effects biological transmutations see the book with that title and other phenomena without an apparent physical origin result from interactions between the psychic planes and the physical plane the major planes are also sub-divided for example a sub-plane of the astral plane is called `` hades '' and the christian hell occupies a small part of it created there less than years ago by the early catholic church by some kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a threatening manner the christian `` heaven '' is located elsewhere on the astral plane good christians will go there for a short while and then reincarnate back to earth sound current vs blind faith the christian religion demands of its followers an extraordinary amount of blind faith backed up by little more than good feeling which is totally deceiving if a person is not hearing some form of the `` sound current '' `` the word '' `` the bani '' `` the audible life stream '' then his cycles of reincarnation in this miserable world will continue the `` sound current '' manifests differently for different initiates and can sound like a rushing wind ocean waves on the sea shore buzzing bees higher-pitched buzzing sound a flute various heavenly music or other sounds in eckankar members start hearing it near the end of their first year as a member this and other experiences such as `` soul travel '' replace blind faith for

20, document_id subject re who 's next mormons and jews from `` casper c. knies '' isscck byuvm.bitnet isaac kuo saackuo spam.berkeley.edu writes in article 93109.231733isscck byuvm.bitnet `` casper c. knies '' isscck byuvm .b gedaliah friedenberg friedenb maple.egr.msu.edu writes as a latter-day saint i found john 's statement not at all ludicrous ... please allow me to explain myself in the governor of missouri governor boggs issued his so-called `` mormon extermination order '' the only crime `` illegal activity '' the latter-day saints had committed was their religious affiliation their anti-slave stance missouri still allowed slave practices and their growing numbers/influence in missouri i guess the mormons `` got what they deserved '' because they refused to bow to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities this `` disobedience '' brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from their lands and settlements ... it is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by '' average '' people and that at the time almost all americans were pretty homogeonously christian it was largely the mainstream christian 's disgust at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred true but that is exactly the `` problem '' the mormon extermination order was issued not just by a christian it was allowed under the constitution of the united states which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this `` order '' from occurring in the first place ... as i indicated in an earlier posting your `` irrational hatred '' is clearly evidenced by individuals like robert weiss who could have been gov boggs lieutenant he would have fitted right in drewling et al and seems a modern-day occurrence based on results slander persecution misrepresentation lies denying mormons representation in their own user group etc etc in intent and purpose what really has changed the situation is not entirely different today many irrational feelings and beliefs are justified through religion i do n't think most of them are started because of religion but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages critical thought true as evidenced by numerous examples as i am sure you 're aware in any regard mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities and i do n't even discuss how uthan 's were suckered into allowing part of their lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds ... is far from being trusted or righteous have things really changed for the better i may be a born cynic but i have no reason whatsoever that such has been the case in the early 1980s i believe the late president kimball lds church leader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the mx- '' peace keeper '' missile maze from being built in utah yet another `` inspired '' decision from secular authorities fortunately his opposition was influential enough for the feds to back off do you mean that the `` secular authorities '' are some continuous group of people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the mormons do you honestly believe that the main reason for using utah for nuclear testing etc .. was to `` get them thar mormons '' and what about the majority of uthan 's who are n't mormons you seem to be searching for enemy ^^^^^^^^ correction the majority of utahn 's are mormon 60-70 i believe up to a in many cities and settlements throughout the western states conspiracies it is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly must have been done primarily for that purpose what i mean is that secular authorities are to be watched as we believe that satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth judgment and justice in addition we believe that the adversary has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous greed for money would be a good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression and evil combinations as an intelligent being do n't you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power as far as utah is concerned what i pointed out were some horrible examples of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities which have brought death disease i.e the `` downwinders '' and environmental contami- nation i am hardly `` paranoid '' i am just not `` expecting '' too much from a secular government that may not share our values and faith and which indeed as gov boggs et al may be out to harm and destroy us as a matter of fact prophecies in my church indicate that in future years global persecution against mormons will so increase in intensity and scope that paraphrasing `` all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to zion '' zion the `` pure in heart '' will be re-established in those days and it ai n't our current secular authorities who will rule over it ... ... david koresh did not pose a great threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and with john i too wonder who or what 's next ... i personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the life of even one person sure he did not pose a threat to the security of this nation but he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers that much is definite hmmm `` definite '' by whom -- until such has been established beyond reason- able doubt this alleged `` threat '' may have been less than the `` threat '' imposed upon him and his followers by the batf and fbi ... who killed who what constitutional right did the atf officers have to invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound what really caused the `` murder '' of the little children could it be that the atf/fbi presence has any bearing upon the events how would you interpret the mt masada events -- blame the jews what the heck did the romans do there anyway what business did the atf/fbi has in waco texas the branch davidians never posed any threat to society this is like asking who really caused the deaths of the israeli olympic team in in that case the police botched the job as well but to lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake i think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case certainly if david koresh chose any peaceful option the atf and fbi would have complied the responsibility is more his than the authorities come now at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise peaceful stand-off `` let 's get it over with and `` force '' david koresh to come out '' -- by gassing them were they naive or what they played right into the hands of an apocalyptic-thinking individual he had prepared his people for this eventuality for years and not one firetruck or plan was in place to deal with this scenario i feel that the authorities had `` some '' responsibility to protect their own citizens even if they were religious zealots and guilty of ... not paying a gun license has the batf become an extension of the local tax-collectors david koresh no doubt will be described as the `` evil '' guy by the executioners while the actions of all those `` valiant and brave '' officers characterizing the atf/fbi as executioners is inaccurate and unfair in order to be an executioner the least one must have done is have the intent to kill que -- intrusion into private property with semi 's loaded with life ammunition is n't that implicit `` intent or at least `` prepared '' to kill '' i ask you would the batf warrant stand up in a civil court of justice i do not mind if criminals such as dangerous drug

'' you ca n't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant the bible states that lucifer was created the bible states that jesus is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same ra your point that we all are brothers of jesus and lucifer is also ra heretical since we are not innately brothers and sisters of christ ra we are adopted `` for ye have not received

symbolic term in the new ra testament mormons believe that we are `` adopted '' into the house of ra israel through baptism and faith in christ although some have expressed ra belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one matthew 13:38 i speak that which i have seen

life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent '' ra john 17:3 life eternal is to know the only true god yet the ra doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly ra different jesus a jesus that can not be reconciled with the jesus of ra the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim ra one as being true denies the other from being true according to the ra bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination ra ra ra robert with all due respect who died and left you chief arbiter of ra correct biblical interpretation i do n't mean to be snotty about this ra but the fact is that the bible is so differently interpreted by different ra groups of biblical scholars what do you think of the jehovah's ra witnesses for example that to make reference to the `` jesus of the ra bible '' is simply ridiculous whose `` jesus of the bible '' do you mean this is really a red herring it does n't address any issue raised but rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read something into the bible does n't change what the bible teaches for example the fact that the jehovah 's witnesses deny the deity of christ does not alter what the bible teaches `` looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ '' titus 2:13 '' simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ '' peter 1:1 on the deity of christ we first look to the bible to see what it teaches to discount or not even address what the bible teaches because there are some groups that have differing views is self-defeating to see what the bible teaches you have to look at the bible ra `` our lord 's mortality was essential to his own salvation '' _the ra promised messiah_ p. `` he had to work out his own salvation by ra doing the will of the father in all things '' ibid. p.54 `` he had ra to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom '' _mormon ra doctrine_ p.71 ra ra welcome to the wonderful world of mormon paradoctrine robert the ra above books are by the late bruce r. mcconkie a former general authority ra of the lds church those books were not published by the church nor do ra they constitute `` offical doctrine '' they consist of his opinions now ra does that mean that what he says is not true not at all i 'll have to ra think about the idea of christ 's personal salvation before i come to any ra conclusions myself the conclusions i come to may seem `` heretical '' to ra you but i 'm prepared to accept that i find this rather curious when i mentioned that the mormon belief is that jesus needed to be saved i put forward some quotes from the late apostle bruce mcconkie the curious part is that no one addressed the issue of jesus needing to be saved rick comes the closest with his `` i have my own conclusions '' to addressing the point most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine i don't think that it matters if mcconkie 's views were canon that is not the issue were mcconkie 's writings indicative of mormon belief on this subject is the real issue the

c5wia1.4hr apollo.hp.com goykhman apollo.hp.com red herring writes the fbi claims on the basis of their intelligence reports that bd 's had no plans to commit suecide they btw had bugged the place and were listening to bd 's conversations till the very end koresh 's attorney claims that based on some hours he spent talking to his client and others in the compound he saw no indication that bd 's were contemplating suecide the survivors claim it was not a suecide it 's not clear that more than one of the survivors made this claim it is clear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim that bd members had started the fire no this is far from clear we only have the word of the fbi spokepeople that a survivor made this claim we have the contradictory word of the lawyers who spoke with the survivors individually that all of them agreed that they did not have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire in the absense of any more evidence i do n't see how we can decide who to believe furthermore its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else with the state of the area now we may never know what happened bd 's were not contemplating suecide and there is no reason to believe they committed one no reason how about these two some of the survivors claimed that bd members poured fuel along the corridors and set fire to it the speed at which the fire spread is not inconsistent with this claim again we have only the word of the fbi on this claim the lawyers who have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim there was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound there is a very very good possibility that the fbi did not start this fire this is a good reason to believe that the bd 's did i will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities its more likely that the bd 's started the fire than did the fbi but there is currently no way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence which is nearly none even if the bd 's were not contemplating suicide it is very possible that david koresh was convinced and thus convinced the others that this was not suicide it was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort there are three possibilities other than the bd 's self destruction a they are not dead but escaped via bunker etc from reports of the inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found i would rate this as highly unlikely b the fire was started by an fbi accident this is possible but it would be foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it sure it 's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern which started the fire why was there a lit lantern in the middle of the day near the edge of the complex it 's anecdotal evidence that has been contradicted by other escapees c. the fire was started on purpose by the fbi this has been suggested by some on the net and i would rate this possibility as utterly ludicrous this is what we in `` sci.skeptic '' would call an '' extraordinary claim '' and wo n't bother refuting unless someone gives any good evidence to back it up d. the fire was an started accidentally by the bds i am truely amazed that i have heard or read of no one suggesting this possibility with all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adults wearing gas masks it had to have been chaotic inside i can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over with the winds it would have quickly gotten out of control so we are left with two reasonable possibilities that the fire was an fbi accident and that the fire was started by the bd i find the latter more likely based on the evidence i 've seen so far no i think that d is also quite reasonable i personally ca n't really asses any relative probablities to either of these probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue i would probably take an accident either fbi or bd over intential setting of the fire i would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds the coroner was on the today show this morning and categorically denied that they 've reach any such conclusions he pointed out that under intense heat sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports i 've read and heard in short there 's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on monday we should remain skeptical until more

'' cf `` kermit '' thread on what exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call `` orthodox '' who is that `` holds that '' luke meant what you said he meant whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to `` look at the bible '' in order to see the truth but what of those who see biblical things differently from you are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it rick i think we can safely say robert is not the only person who understands the bible and the leadership of the lds church historicly never has let 's consider some `` personal interpretations '' and see how much trust we should put in `` orthodox mormonism '' which could never be confused with orthodox christianity in one of his attacks on christians the mormon apostle bruce r. mcconkie said they `` thrash around in ... darkness in trying to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised messiah '' he also said christians are wrong to believe `` that jehovah is the supreme deity god the father '' and that christ `` came into mortality '' as his `` only begotten '' son mcconkie then stated what mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter he said that `` elohim is the father '' and `` jehovah is the son '' `` being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists have gone in defining their three-in-one god it comes as no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised messiah some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity whose son came into mortality as the only begotten as with their concept that god is a spirit this misinformation about the gods of heaven is untrue the fact is and it too is attested by holy writ that elohim is the father and that jehovah is the son who was born into mortality as the lord jesus christ the promised messiah promised messiah p. notice that mcconkie said the christians are as wrong about their `` three-in-one god '' and their belief that `` god is a spirit '' as they are in their understanding of who `` elohim '' and `` jehovah '' are before examining mcconkie 's attack and its validity we shall read a few more statements by mcconkie and other mormon sources concerning the words '' elohim '' and `` jehovah '' mcconkie stated `` ... the chief designation of christ that has been preserved for us in the old testament as that ancient work is now published is the exalted name-title jehovah promised messiah p. `` _elohim_ plural word though it is is also used as the exalted name-title of god the eternal father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being god above all gods mormon doctrine p. agreeing with mcconkie on the question of who `` elohim '' and '' jehovah '' are the apostle james e. talmage stated `` _elohim_ as understood and used in the restored church of jesus christ is the name-title of god the eternal father whose firstborn son in the spirit is _jehovah_ -- the only begotten in the flesh jesus christ jesus the christ p. `` a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve '' apostles of the mormon church states that `` god the eternal father ... is designate d by the exalted name-title 'elohim ... '' articles of faith p. `` ... christ in his preexistent antemortal or unembodied state ... was known as jehovah ... '' articles of faith p. today mormon leaders teach that `` elohim '' in the ot refers to god the father and `` jehovah '' refers to christ mcconkie attacked christians for saying `` jehovah '' can refer to the father he stressed that these two '' name-titles '' should not be changed around so that christ is called '' elohim '' and the father is called `` jehovah '' `` ... the father ... is elohim not jehovah .... jehovah is christ and christ is jehovah they are one and the same person '' promised messiah p. in the ot of the kjv of the bible the hebrew word `` elohim '' is used to refer to the true god false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel when referring to the true god `` elohim '' is translated with a capital `` g. '' when referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel it is translated with a small `` g. '' it is translated four times as `` judges '' exod 21:6 22:8-9 once as `` judge '' sam 2:25 twice as `` mighty '' gen. 23:6 exod 9:28 once as `` angels '' ps 8:5 once as `` godly '' mal 2:15 once as `` great '' gen. 30:8 and once as '' very great '' sam 14:15 the word `` jehovah '' is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel points taken from the word '' adonai '' many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was yahweh or yahveh however since `` jehovah '' rather than yahweh is the word used by mormonism this section will also use '' jehovah '' instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of mormon leaders regarding that name `` jehovah '' unlike `` elohim '' is never used of false gods it is the personal name of the triune god of the bible in the kjv `` jehovah '' is rendered primarily `` lord '' sometimes '' god '' and rarely `` lord '' now that we understand something about the words `` elohim '' and '' jehovah '' and their use by mormon leaders we shall consider the apostle mcconkie 's attack on christians for believing the father is `` jehovah '' in trying to prove that `` jehovah '' refers exclusively to christ mcconkie cited several verses from the bible some of these verses and mcconkie's interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right remember mcconkie said the father is not `` jehovah '' he is only '' elohim '' the first example we shall consider involves mcconkie's interpretation of ps 110:1 of this verse he stated `` of whom spake david when his tongue was touched by the holy spirit and he testified `` the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool '' ps 110:1 two lords are here involved one is speaking to the other one is greater than the other one is making provision for the triumph and glory of the other who are they and what message is contained in this messianic prophecy `` what think ye of christ '' our lord asked certain of his detractors toward the end of his mortal ministry `` whose son is he '' is christ the son of god or of someone else is he to be born of a divine parent or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father that he was to be a descendant of david was a matter of great pride to all the jews and so they answered `` the son of david '' david 's son truly he was but he was more much more and so our lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture asked `` how then doth david in spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool if david then call him lord how is he his son '' that is if he is only the son of david how is it that the great king acting under inspiration calls him lord and worships him as such and we might add _who is the other lord the one who spake unto david 's lord can there be any question as to how jesus is interpreting the words of the psalm he is saying that it means '_the father said unto the son elohim said unto jehovah_ sit thou on my right hand until after your mortal ministry then i will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever promised messiah pp 101-102 emphasis added agreeing with the above statement by mcconkie the following remark in the mormon pamphlet _what the mormons think of christ p. reads `` the lord elohim the father said unto my lord jehovah the son ... '' brackets in original mcconkie clearly stated that it is `` elohim '' the father who is speaking to `` jehovah '' the son in this psalm however when one looks at the hebrew word translated `` lord '' it becomes apparent that either the first `` lord '' is not the father or else the father is `` jehovah '' either way mcconkie is wrong the psalm reads `` the lord jehovah said unto my lord adon sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool ps 110:1 the first `` lord '' in this verse is `` jehovah '' who mormonism says is christ not the father the second `` lord '' is the hebrew word `` adon '' singular for `` adonai '' meaning master or lord if the first `` lord '' is the father and the second `` lord '' is the son then the father is '' jehovah '' and the son is `` adon '' however if the father is not `` jehovah '' as mcconkie claimed then the first `` lord '' is `` jehovah '' the son but who then is `` adon '' obviously the father is `` jehovah '' in this psalm and his son is `` adon '' another example involves isa 42:6 about which mcconkie stated the following `` i the lord have called thee in righteousness '' _isaiah quoted the father as saying of christ_ `` and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles '' isa 42:6 promised messiah p. emphasis added mcconkie said the father was speaking of christ in this passage which reads `` i the lord jehovah have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles isa 42:6 according to mcconkie `` i the lord '' refers to the father and '' thine '' and `` thee '' refer to christ however the `` lord '' who is speaking is `` jehovah '' which means either mcconkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the father is `` jehovah '' another example involves ps 22:7-8 of these verses mcconkie stated `` the same psalm says `` all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him '' ps 22:7-8 _the fulfillment as jesus hung on the cross_ is found in these words `` the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he can not save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth '' matt 27:41-44 promised messiah pp 530-531 emphasis added ps 22:7-8 reads as follows `` all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord jehovah that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him mcconkie said these verses had their fulfillment `` as jesus hung on the cross '' that means the person who was scorned in these verses was christ who then was the `` lord '' in whom he trusted it was `` jehovah '' the father another example involves ps 31:13 and ps 41:9 regarding them mcconkie stated the following `` with reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our lord 's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was `` they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life '' ps 31:13 as to the role of judas in those conspiracies the psalmist says `` mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me '' ps 41:9 promised messiah p. apostle mcconkie said these psalms refer to christ 's `` arrest and judicial trials '' we shall first consider ps and then ps while mcconkie only quoted verse of ps verse will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter `` for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life but i trusted in thee o lord jehovah i said thou art my god elohim ps 31:13-14 mcconkie said verse referred to jesus christ verse goes on to tell that he christ trusted in the `` lord '' who is called his '' god '' or `` elohim '' mormonism teaches that the god above jesus is '' elohim '' the father verse however reveals that the `` elohim '' of the man jesus is `` jehovah '' the father in ps mcconkie only quoted one verse however two verses will be considered in this examination `` yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me but thou o lord jehovah be merciful unto me and raise me up that i may requite them ps 41:9-10 mcconkie stated above that verse referred to judas role in christ 's death since it was judas who was the `` familiar friend '' who '' lifted up his heel '' the pronouns `` mine '' `` i '' `` my '' and `` me '' in verse must refer to christ notice that at the beginning of verse there is a change of pronoun to `` thou '' which refers to the `` lord '' jehovah then the pronouns `` me '' and `` i '' which refer to christ are used again that means christ was speaking to `` jehovah '' the father in these verses another example involves mcconkie 's following remark about ps 110:4 `` one of the great messianic prophecies spoken by the mouth of david says `` the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek '' ps 110:4 promised messiah p. mcconkie admitted this is a messianic prophecy involving christ the question is what in this verse refers to christ `` the lord jehovah hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek ps 110:4 does the `` lord '' which is `` jehovah '' refer to christ if mcconkie is right and jesus is `` jehovah '' but the father is not then the `` lord '' would have to refer to christ but who then is the one addressed as the `` priest forever after the order of melchizedek '' the bible reveals that the one referred to is jesus christ heb 5:8-10 6:20 therefore the `` lord '' jehovah in ps 110:4 is the father another example involves isa 53:4-12 of these verses mcconkie stated `` of the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah isaiah said ... the _lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all .... it pleased the _lord_ to bruise him ... promised messiah p. emphasis added mcconkie rightly said these verses refer to `` the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah '' however what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the father is `` jehovah '' verse reads `` all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord jehovah hath laid on him christ the iniquity of us all '' and verse reads `` yet it pleased the lord jehovah to bruise him christ ... '' obviously the `` lord '' who laid on christ `` the iniquity of us all '' and who bruised him is god the father who is called `` jehovah '' in these verses remember mcconkie stated that `` some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity '' and that christ `` came into mortality '' as his `` only begotten '' son he called this concept '' misinformation '' that is `` untrue '' to prove that it is mcconkie who is misinformed and believing untruth two scriptural references sam 7:14 ps 2:7 will be examined mcconkie stated the following regarding these scriptures `` in the midst of a passage that is clearly messianic the lord says of the seed of david `` i will be his father and he shall be my son '' sam 7:14 in the second psalm the whole of which is also clearly messianic occurs this statement `` thou art my son this day have i begotten thee '' ps 2:7 paul quotes both of these statements in hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that christ would come as the son of god promised messiah p. mcconkie cited heb 1:5 to show that sam 7:14 and ps 2:7 refer to christ who `` would come as the son of god '' since mcconkie first referenced sam 7:14 this examination will too however along with verse verses 11-13 will also be included `` and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the lord jehovah telleth thee that he will make thee an house and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever i will be his father and he shall be my son sam 7:11-14 these verses teach that the `` lord '' jehovah would have a son the messiah in the second example mcconkie cited ps 2:7 this examination will include verse notice that it is the `` lord '' jehovah who says '' thou art my son this day have i begotten thee '' `` i will declare the decree the lord jehovah hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession mcconkie said these verses of scripture are `` clearly messianic '' and he acknowledged they teach that `` christ would come as the son of god '' what he is not willing to acknowledge however is that these scriptures also teach that the father is `` jehovah '' and that the '' sectarians '' who believe `` jehovah is the supreme deity whose son '' is jesus christ `` the only begotten '' are right in their belief another example involves mic 5:4 of this verse mcconkie stated the following `` and so truly did our lord act _during his mortal ministry truly this is he of whom it is written_ `` he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord in the majesty of the name of the lord his god ... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth '' mic 5:4 promised messiah p. emphasis added according to mcconkie the pronoun `` he '' at the beginning of mic 5:4 refers to christ `` during his mortal ministry '' who then is the '' lord his god '' mic 5:4 reads `` and he christ shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord jehovah in the majesty of the name of the lord jehovah his god elohim ... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth obviously the `` lord '' of jesus christ is `` jehovah '' the father who is referred to as `` jehovah his elohim '' another example involves ps 2:2 and isa 61:1 of these verses mcconkie stated the following `` a number of messianic passages speak of `` the lord and ... his anointed '' ps 2:2 signifying that the chosen one was consecrated and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his _jesus applied these passages to himself_ by quoting isaiah 's prophecy `` the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek '' isa 61:1 and then saying `` this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears '' luke 4:21 promised messiah pp 182-183 emphasis added the first source mcconkie quoted -- ps 2:2 -- reads as follows `` the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord jehovah and against his anointed mcconkie said the `` anointed '' one was christ if that is true who was `` jehovah '' if `` jehovah '' is always christ who was the `` anointed '' one obviously `` jehovah '' is referring to god the father and the '' anointed '' is indeed referring to christ the second source mcconkie cited is isa 61:1 which states `` the spirit of the lord adonai god jehovah is upon me because the lord jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound the one who was anointed to preach bind up proclaim and open was jesus christ who then was the one who anointed him this verse says the `` lord '' jehovah did the anointing again we face the same problem if `` jehovah '' does not refer to the father but only to christ then jesus anointed someone but who as mcconkie pointed out `` jesus applied these passages to himself '' therefore the `` jehovah '' who anointed christ is god the father other examples could be cited to show that mcconkie and other mormon leaders are wrong when they say god the father is not `` jehovah '' however these should be enough to expose their error now what about mormonism 's claim that jesus is `` jehovah '' but he is not `` elohim '' it is true that jesus is `` jehovah '' the following scriptures prove this fact `` thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god isa 44:6 jesus said ... i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead ... rev 1:17-18 `` ... saith the lord jehovah ... they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son ... zech 12:1,10 behold he christ cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him ... rev 1:7 `` ... i am the lord jehovah thy god the holy one of israel ... isa 43:3 ... ye denied the holy one christ and the just ... acts

under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts 4:10,12 `` behold the lord god jehovah will come with strong hand ... his reward is with him ... isa 40:10 ... behold i christ come quickly and my reward is with me ... rev 22:12 `` ... the lord jehovah my god shall come and all the saints with thee zech 14:5 `` ... at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints thess 3:13 ``

come to seek and to save that which was lost luke 19:10 `` for i am the lord jehovah thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour ... isa 43:3 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ tit 2:13 see also jer 42:5 and rev 1:5 mal 3:6 and heb 13:8 kin 8:28,39 and john 2:24-25 isa 25:8 and tim 1:10 ps 107:24,29 and matt 8:26 prov.3:12 and rev 3:19 while mormons are right when they say jesus is `` jehovah '' they are wrong when they say he is not `` elohim '' the bible reveals that '' jehovah '' is the only true `` elohim '' there is all others are false remember `` jehovah '' is the personal name of the triune god who has revealed himself in the bible before we consider biblical quotes which show that `` jehovah '' and '' elohim '' are not two separate gods as mormons claims let us first note that not only are both god the father and christ addressed as `` jehovah '' and `` elohim '' but so is the holy spirit `` whereof the _holy ghost_ ... _said_ ... this _is_ the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more heb 10:15-17 emphasis on `` holy ghost '' and `` said '' added behold the days come _saith the lord_ jehovah that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah ... i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god elohim and they shall be my people .... i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more jer 31:31,33-34 emphasis added `` for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the _holy ghost_ pet 1:21 emphasis on `` holy ghost '' added `` the spirit of the lord jehovah spake by me and his word was in my tongue sam 23:2 see also heb 3:7-11 with ps 95:6-11 let us now continue with the biblical quotes which show that '' jehovah '' and `` elohim '' are not two separate gods as mormons claim `` and when the lord jehovah saw that he moses turned aside to see god elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i .... bruce r. mcconkie acknowledged that `` it was '' christ 's `` voice that spoke to moses in the burning bush ... '' promised messiah p. and the lord jehovah said ... and moses said unto god elohim behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god elohim of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god elohim said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you and god elohim said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord jehovah god elohim of your fathers the god elohim of abraham the god elohim of isaac and the god elohim of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations exod 3:4,7,13-15 `` and god elohim spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord jehovah exod 6:2 `` i am the lord jehovah and there is none else there is no god elohim beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me isa 45:5 `` but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim he is the living god elohim and an everlasting king ... jer 10:10 `` thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god elohim isa 44:6 `` therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus saith the lord jehovah whose name is the god elohim of hosts amos 5:27 `` behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lord's jehovah 's thy god elohim the earth also with all that therein is deut 10:14 `` wherefore thou art great o lord jehovah god elohim for there is none like thee neither is there any god elohim beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears sam 7:22 `` and he said unto them i am an hebrew and i fear the lord jehovah the god elohim of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land jon 1:9 `` for who is god elohim save the lord jehovah or who is a rock save our god elohim ps 18:31 `` blessed is the nation whose god elohim is the lord jehovah ... ps 33:12 see also ps 144:15 `` hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god elohim the lord jehovah the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding isa 40:28 `` the mighty god elohim even the lord jehovah hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof ps 50:1 `` sing unto god elohim sing praises to his name estol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name jah and rejoice before him ps 68:4 regarding the word `` jah '' bruce r. mcconkie stated `` jah hebrew yah is a contracted form of jehovah jahveh or yahweh -- all of which names have reference to christ the god of israel '' mormon doctrine p. `` and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god elohim whose name is called by the name of the lord jehovah of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims sam 6:2 `` ... the great the mighty god elohim the lord jehovah of hosts is his name jer 32:18 `` o my god elohim make them like a wheel as the stubble before the wind .... fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o lord jehovah .... that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art the most high over all the earth ps 83:13,16,18 the bible clearly teaches that `` jehovah '' is `` elohim '' in fact he is the only `` elohim '' there is he is the `` true '' the `` living '' the '' mighty '' the `` great '' and the `` everlasting elohim '' he is the `` elohim '' of israel of all the kingdoms of the earth and of the heavens he is the creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon `` jehovah 's '' name is `` elohim of hosts '' amos 5:27 not only is `` jehovah '' `` elohim '' but `` elohim '' is `` jehovah '' the bible reveals that `` elohim 's '' name is `` jah '' ps 68:4 `` jehovah '' ps 83:18 and `` jehovah of hosts '' sam 6:2 jer 32:18 the nation whose `` elohim '' is `` jehovah '' is blessed ps 33:12 clearly this is not the `` jehovah '' and `` elohim '' of the mormons another mormon error regarding `` elohim '' and `` jehovah '' is the belief that `` elohim '' not `` jehovah '' is the father of all the spirits including jesus in the articles of faith by apostle james e. talmage '' a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve '' apostles states that `` god the eternal father ... 'elohim is the literal parent of ... the spirits of the human race '' p. this `` doctrinal exposition '' also states explicitly that `` jesus christ is not the father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth for he is one of them he is the son as they are sons and daughters of elohim '' p. the apostle talmage stated that `` _elohim_ ... is the name-title of god the eternal father whose firstborn son in the spirit is _jehovah_ -- '' jesus the christ p. the apostle bruce r. mcconkie stated the following about this matter `` ... jehovah-christ ... did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof _but when it came to placing man on earth there was a change in creators_ that is the father himself became personally involved all things were created by the son using the power delegated by the father except man _in the spirit and again in the flesh man was created by the father_ there was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned '' promised messiah p. emphasis added mormon leaders claim that `` jehovah-christ '' did not create either man 's spirit or his body they maintain that the mormon `` elohim '' who is the father created man both in spirit and body the bible reveals the truth about who created man `` and moses spake unto the lord jehovah saying let the lord jehovah the god elohim of the _spirits of all flesh_ set a man over the congregation num 27:15-16 see also 16:20-23 emphasis added `` ... the lord jehovah which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and _formeth the spirit of man within him_ zech 12:1 emphasis added `` ... the lord jehovah ... made us this soul ... jer 38:16 `` for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the _souls which i have made_ .... ... saith the lord jehovah ... isa 57:16,19 emphasis on `` souls ... i have made '' added `` behold i am the lord jehovah the god elohim _of all flesh_ ... jer 32:27 emphasis added `` thus saith the lord jehovah thy redeemer and he that _formed thee from the womb_ i am the lord jehovah that maketh all things ... isa 44:24 emphasis added `` thus saith the lord jehovah ... i have made the earth and _created man_ upon it ... isa 45:11-12 emphasis added `` ... god elohim created man upon the earth ... unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord jehovah he is god elohim there is none else beside him deut 4:32,35 `` thus saith god el the lord jehovah ... he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein isa 42:5 `` ... thus saith the lord jehovah of hosts the god elohim of israel ... i have made the earth _the man_ and the beast that are upon the ground ... jer 27:4-5 most emphasis added the bible reveals that it is `` jehovah '' who is the `` elohim of the spirits of all flesh '' and `` of all flesh '' itself that it was he who '' formed the spirit of man within him '' that he `` made us this soul '' and '' formed us from the womb '' he did indeed `` create man '' if mormon leaders are right when they say jesus is `` jehovah '' then they are wrong when they say he did not create man if they are right when they say the father is the one who created man then they are wrong when they say he is not `` jehovah '' although mormon leaders teach that jesus did not create man mormon scriptures teach that he did the bom states the following `` behold i am jesus christ i am the father and the son .... and never have i showed myself unto _man whom i have created_ for never has man believed in me as thou hast .... behold this body which ye now behold is the body of my spirit and _man have i created_ after the body of my spirit ... eth 3:14-16 emphasis added `` for it is i that taketh upon me the sins of the world for it is _i that hath created them_ ... mos 26:23 emphasis added `` ... the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob ... is that same god who created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them are behold _he created adam_ ... mor 9:11-12 emphasis added d c 93:10 states that `` the worlds were made by him christ _men were made by him_ all things were made by him and through him and of him '' emphasis added another error by bruce r. mcconkie involving `` jehovah '' and his creation is the belief that `` jehovah '' had `` many '' pre-mortal spirits helping him create included in this alleged group was joseph smith jr. `` that he christ was aided in the creation of this earth by `` many of the noble and great '' spirit children of the father is evident from abraham 's writings unto those superior spirits christ said `` we will go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell '' abra 3:22-24 michael or adam was one of these enoch noah abraham moses peter james and john joseph smith and many other `` noble and great '' ones played a part in the great creative enterprise doctrines of salvation vol pp 74-75 mormon doctrine p. the bible reveals the truth about this matter `` thus saith the lord jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord jehovah that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself isa 44:24 `` which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea job 9:8 `` jehovah '' by himself created all things he had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting him regarding the mormon 'elohim '' the apostle mcconkie stated '' elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted name-title of god the eternal father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being god above all gods '' mormon doctrine p. he also stated that `` jesus ... is above all save the father only '' promised messiah p. the bible states that the one who is god above all so-called gods is the triune god `` jehovah '' `` for the lord jehovah is a great god el and a great king above all gods elohim ps 95:3 `` for thou lord jehovah art high above all the earth thou art exalted far above all gods elohim ps 97:9 `` now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all gods elohim ... exod 18:11 see also ps 135:5 deut 10:17 if mormon leaders are right when they say `` jehovah '' is god the son and `` elohim '' is god the father these verses from the bible would be teaching that the mormon son is above his father however as mcconkie clearly stated mormons believe `` elohim '' the father not `` jehovah '' the son is the `` god above all gods '' -- that jesus is above all except the father yet the bible teaches that `` jehovah '' is above all `` elohim '' at a byu dev on march bruce r. mcconkie made the following remark about praying to jesus `` another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed .... this is plain sectarian nonsense our prayers are addressed to the father and to him only .... ... perfect prayer is addressed to the father in the name of the son it is uttered by the power of the holy ghost ... our relationship with the lord pp 19-20 mcconkie states on p. of his book promised messiah that the mormons `` pray to the father not the son ... '' on p. of the same book mcconkie states that `` christ the son is jehovah '' this is important to remember because although mcconkie said prayer is not to be offered to the mormon christ who is `` jehovah '' the bible states repeatedly in the ot that people prayed to `` jehovah '' and he not only heard those prayers but he accepted them as valid requests the following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to `` jehovah '' `` in my distress i called upon the lord jehovah and cried unto my god elohim he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears ps 18:6 `` and the lord jehovah said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually kin 9:3 `` and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the lord jehovah thy god elohim even for all this remnant ... jer 42:2 `` o lord jehovah i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name ... neh 1:11 `` and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord jehovah he arose from before the altar of the lord jehovah from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven kin 8:54 `` he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the lord jehovah kin 4:33 `` go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord jehovah the god elohim of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years isa 38:5 `` i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord jehovah and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found ... ps 32:5-6 notice above in ps 32:6 that the `` godly '' pray to `` jehovah '' according to mcconkie and other mormon leaders that is christ the very one to whom mcconkie said people should not pray the bible reveals there is only one true `` elohim '' and his name is `` jehovah '' all other `` elohim '' are false they are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true `` elohim '' and idolatry `` for the lord jehovah is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods elohim for all the gods elohim of the nations are idols but the lord jehovah made the heavens ps 96:4-5 `` thou shalt have no other gods elohim before me exod 20:3 `` now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all gods elohim ... exod 18:11 `` and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god elohim and walk after other gods elohim and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish deut 8:19 `` thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods elohim they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me for if thou serve their gods elohim it will surely be a snare unto thee exod 23:32- `` take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods elohim and worship them deut 11:16 `` that ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods elohim nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them josh 23:7 `` ... neither walk after other gods elohim to your hurt jer 7:6 `` but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim he is the living god elohim ... jer 10:10 `` and they forsook the lord jehovah god elohim of their fathers which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods elohim of the gods elohim of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the lord jehovah to anger jud 2:12 `` shall a man make gods elohim unto himself and they are no gods elohim therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the lord jehovah jer 16:20-21 `` and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord jehovah choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods elohim which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods elohim of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord jehovah and the people answered and said god elohim forbid that we should forsake the lord jehovah to serve other gods elohim josh 24:15-16 these verses teach that the only true living `` elohim '' in heaven and on earth is `` jehovah '' -- the triune god who made heaven and earth and all therein `` jehovah '' is greater than any `` elohim '' because all other '' elohim '' are idols the reality behind them is demonic deut 32:17 '' jehovah elohim '' has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false `` elohim '' he told his people not to have any `` elohim '' but him he told the people that if they left him for the false `` elohim '' those `` elohim '' would be a snare to them and they would be hurt and would perish he warned the people to `` take heed '' that their `` heart be not deceived '' into worshiping serving swearing by and making covenants with false `` elohim '' `` jehovah elohim '' told his people he would eventually judge all false `` elohim '' and their followers despite these warnings and guidelines `` elohim 's '' covenant people forsook him and believed in and worshiped the false `` elohim 's '' of the people they came in contact with ju 10:6 states that `` the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord jehovah and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods elohim of syria and the gods elohim of zidon and the gods elohim of moab and the gods elohim of the children of ammon and the gods elohim of the philistines and forsook the lord jehovah and served not him '' this examination has shown that the `` elohim '' of mormonism like the `` elohim '' in ju 10:6 is not the true `` jehovah elohim '' therefore the people who leave the true `` elohim '' for the mormon `` elohim '' will do '' evil ... in the sight of the lord jehovah '' although mcconkie attacked christians for their belief in a triune god who is spirit and for their belief that god the father jehovah sent his son into the world these beliefs are true god is triune he is spirit he is `` jehovah '' and he did send his son into the world to redeem mankind it is obvious from this examination that it is not the christians who `` thrash around in ... darkness '' about who `` elohim '' and '' jehovah '' are one wonders what `` holy writ '' mcconkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that `` elohim is the father and that jehovah is the son '' he certainly did not mean the bible which teaches that the father son and holy spirit are all the one `` jehovah elohim '' he apparently did not mean the d c either because chapter verses 1,4,9-10 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the father as '' jehovah '' summary obviously joseph fielding smith 's statement that the mormons '' have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of god '' doctrines of salvation 1:279 is not accurate the mormon gods are not the true god as mormonism claims but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against god and idolatry in answer to jesus question `` but whom say ye that i am '' mormons say jesus is someone different from the jesus who is revealed in the bible and whom the apostles preached therefore anyone trusting in the mormon jesus is believing in `` another jesus '' whom paul warned about bernard p. brockbank of the first quorum of the seventy admitted in the may issue of the ensign a mormon publication that the mormon jesus is different from the christian jesus he stated that '' it is true that many of the christian churches worship a different jesus christ than is worshipped by the mormons or the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints '' p. the people who believe in the mormon jesus are committing adultery against god and idolatry they do not have the son therefore they do not have the father and they do not have eternal life as the apostle bruce r. mcconkie rightly stated `` salvation comes only by worshiping the true god '' promised messiah p. mcconkie also rightly stated that `` the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living god '' because the `` true names of deity '' can be applied to `` false concepts of god '' mormon doctrine p. remember that the apostle stephen l. richards admitted that joseph smith jr. gave `` a new conception of god and the godhead '' contributions of joseph smith p. it is important for the people who have left the true triune god revealed in the bible to repent and return to him they must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in mormonism the bible says `` ... all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the lord jehovah the fountain of living waters jer 17:13 `` and it shall be if thou do at all

4, document_id from wlsmith valve.heart.rri.uwo.ca wayne smith subject re ide vs scsi in article c5lkev.hpj feanor.xel.com shaw feanor.xel.com greg shaw writes why do n't you start with the spec-sheet of the isa bus first you can quote scsi specs till you 're blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bus capability then what 's the point who said isa was necessary eisa or vlb are the only interfaces worth investing thousands of dollars e.g a new pc 's worth of money in then do n't complain maybe it was n't you that scsi was so expensive on pc 's because all we 've had until a year or two ago was the isa bus ie no one buys scsi for isa because isa is slow are you saying that scsi on an isa bus is not an automatic winner when compared to ide you did n't read to carefully vlb-ide uses the same connection mechanism as standard ide if transfer rate is limited by ide whether it's interfaced to isa eisa or vlb matters not i get different transfer rates out of my ide when i change my isa bus speed on mine for one thing scsi blows ide out of the water hands down if ide has better throughput why is n't it used on workstations and file servers ide is just a variant of the old ibm- mfm at controller at least that's how it looks from a software point of view it was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms is there any argument that ide can or ca n't transfer data from the ide drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data are scsi versions of ide drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their scsi interface because of a higher rpm platter different arrangement of heads etc given the original question scsi used only as a single hard drive controller is it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least maybe megs/sec for the scsi choice to make any sence what does a 200-400 meg megs/sec scsi drive cost no that 's the nice thing -- on a multitasking os scsi can use both drives at once i 've got unix loaded on one of my pcs along with windogs and the os can only use one of the two ide drives at one time it 's pretty ugly if data is going from one drive to another and if scsi has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the cpu or main memory then yes that is the optimal way to do it as far as i know ide ca n't do that but when the cpu wants data from both drives data to be stored in main memory are you saying that scsi can grab data from both drives at the same time and store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time working off irq and dma channel on an isa or whatever bus i just bought at quantum for my mac at home i paid for it i have n't seen ide drives cheaper a friend of mine just got a maxtor meg ide drive for that 's million bytes or mega-bytes with the basic interface he gets close to meg/sec transfer on his 286-20 does your figure include a few hundred for scsi drivers no actually we 're talking about scsi being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the pc if they had a common read easily implemented method of adding scsi to a pc like as in a sun or mac then you 'd find scsi the connection medium of choice so you 're saying that scsi would have been the default interface type considering that the vast majority of pc 's do n't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc that most pc 's only have or had hard drive and run dos that scsi hard drives cost a lot more than mfm or rll drives at the time and how common were scsi drives under megs to years ago there 's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented scsi from becoming the connection medium of choice i wo n't argue that the scsi standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bus when it comes to multi-tasking os 's when managing data from a single scsi hard drive on a single drive scsi is more expensive but on that point is it faster this is what all this is about do you get more performance for the money for all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system regardless of the os will the scsi choice really give them more performance than ide but you bought your pc for expandibility so you 'd want to add more drives or whatever true but expandibility can also start on the bus which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards you can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently no argument this is always held up to the first time scsi buyer as the best reason but how many scsi devices will the first time scsi buyer eventually acquire again does it make sense to go scsi for a single hard drive system a scsi device works on many different machines i have a mac and a pc at home and moving hard drives between them is very nice with scsi -- hook them up and away they go with all the postings on the scsi i or ii specs are you really sure that pc and apple scsi hard drives are compatible and even if they are is the data accessible from either machine ie are there no formatting/ partitioning or file table differences is it really plug'n'play scsi devices work together better than ide devices for instance recently i added an older connor meg ide to a maxtor meg ide the connor must be setup as the slave it will work no other way on scsi you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it goes so the c drive on the connor becomes a logical d drive to dos is this really a problem i have a problem with ide 's mutual exclusion i notice that the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c to drive d is quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c to d on a scsi system under a multitasking os this is very noticable as many things can be going on at once after having two ide drives in my system for temporary file transfers i have never seen any differences when switching between drives nor have i ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to/from the same drive one neat thing that i 've noticed lately a fringe benefit has been the ability to add older almost dead drives as storage on a scsi system with little problem -- we 've got a bunch of almost dead meg drives that i've added to my pc i 've now got the interface full but it does allow me to have meg drives meg drive tape drive and meg drive all on the same card that is nice as long as the power supply can keep up i do believe that there is the possibility for up to ide drives on a pc simply put scsi is handier than ide no mysterious jumpers to figure out but what about `` mysterious '' and expensive drivers to figure out at least ide does n't require drivers that consume precious conventional dos memory

'' this is so you know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource if you go to vol it says `` likewise if a modifier is specified there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well for example the translation shift key q quit will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as the shift key and the q key this is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs it 's not true for menu accelerators if you 're a motif implementor i 'd suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics changed to support the feature i described above otherwise change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations because menu accelerators are not the same thing as translations is it possible to supply accelerator for a menu entry if you mean `` menu accelerator '' no it 's not possible that 's according to the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you ca n't use xtinstallaccelerators i ca n't think of a reason why not how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case what i want is ctrl+o and ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one menu entry i find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing if i were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators i would have one resource called `` accelerators '' that took a translation table period i would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed as soon as the end-user specified one it would be active and automatically installed to get multiple accelerators on a single menu item i 'd do something like menuitem.accelerators override    ctrl key m fire    shift key l fire   the accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a `` ctrl m '' show up in your menuitem object why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different special cases depending on what type of widget you 're dealing with there has to be some reason sorry for the political tone of this message ... -- tom lastrange toml boulder.parcplace.com

8, document_id from nathanp sco.com nathan subject re ford probe opinions centered around the gt '' jeremy g. mereness '' zonker+ cmu.edu says can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ... ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i am considering the mx-6 probe accord corolla and the 240sx the probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions but every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value btw the 240sx is rear-wheel drive and is due for a re-design for thanks in advance while i do n't read normally read this group i was looking for valentine radar information sigh maybe in the faq and came across your posting .. i bought a '93 probe gt with the pep 263a last july now at miles after debating over the sentra se-r/nx2000 mx6 mr-2 stealth prelude and celica check this month 's consumer reports for previous probe records my criteria a `` fun '' car with abs airbag over 130hp and less than 25k i thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out the tri-star cars eclipse/talon/etc were out since they do n't have an air bag ditto for the mustang also no abs the se-r/nx2000/m20 fell into the pocket-rocket category a good used car buy the mx-6 was almost there but rolled more than i liked i did n't like the prelude dash/instrumentation at all too weird for me the mr2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than i needed so out that went the celica was `` ok '' but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat overpriced too in non-turbo form i never considered the 240sx since it did n't have an airbag i did look at it for its rwd virtues but that 's it the corolla never entered my mind i should have looked at the mitsubishi vr4/dodge stealth more since my list was exhausted i bought the probe the car design is different than earlier years so it 's too early to see its reliability so far for what it 's worth my comments my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal headlights have `` stuck '' up a few times weather air conditioning broke ~4000 miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container does n't drain completely crammed engine little hope for do-it-yourselfers typical parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic does n't like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not stitched properly hopefully just a fluke ford only gives key with the car c'mon ford spend an extra few pennies rear hatch has no padding on corners when up i 'm waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car my likes engine design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque -- definitely handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the '90 sho i drive stability at 100+mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather abs/air bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes still tires 225/55vr16 goodyear eagles left hoping for 30k as you can see i 'm primarily interested in the engine while it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum value 2.5 liter engine the overall car is a good buy for the money that market segment has n't changed much since july prelude vtec honda del sol i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probe 's suspension does n't like potholes when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable if you have 3+ passengers by all means bring them along too they 'll find that they have no room in the back and you 'll find that the car rides differently if that 's `` better '' is up to you also there 's a lot of glass around you which i was n't expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat i 've heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine leather and the keyless entry system were n't available when i got the car so i ca n't comment on them i got the car before it was officially announced i prefer cloth to leather anyway i would n't want this car in the snow the suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes tires are n't meant for snow and the seats assume that you 're not wearing lots of thick clothing rain is much better water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable and i barely hydroplaned once with the eagles and i was really trying there is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places the gt has map holders below the speakers in the door but they 're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or cd 's max the center console/storage bin/arm rest has cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth `` pouch '' but that 's it no change holders quite a let-down from the sho and the probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car lastly do n't store wet car covers in the back the foam will soak the water up and the result will not smell pleasant nathan nathan sco.com

8, document_id from eliot lanmola.engr.washington.edu eliot subject re improvements in automatic transmissions an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy it switches to '' sport '' mode when the electronics figure it not when the driver sets the switch .. which is the proper way to do it imo so what does `` sport '' mode entail several things revving to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy delayed upshifts i.e if you lift off briefly it will remain in the low gear this is handy if you are charging through corners and would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's another curve approaching part throttle downshifts based on the speed at which the pedal is depressed rather than the position of the pedal modern electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough also i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick all else being equal .. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation .. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear of a speed how many of people who drive manuals really know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation i 'm sure there will be some who know but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in rom is likely to do better i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout ... high gear low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear high revs and small throttle opening the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it but not that obvious at first sight eliot

welcome to rec.autos === this article is sent out automatically each month and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups and some suggested guidelines for discussions the keywords monthly posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities this article is posted to all autos groups but followups are directed only to if you don't understand what this means ask your system administrator for help or at least for copies of the newuser documentation failing that please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there introduction to the rec.autos newsgroup hierarchy rec.autos.tech is intended for technical discussions of automobiles their design construction diagnosis and service other discussions are largely inappropriate especially for sale ads rec.autos.sport is intended for discussion of legal organized competition involving automobiles technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles discussion from either of two viewpoints spectator and participant is encouraged arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate as are most other discussions for sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment discussions of illegal events are marginal one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law remember the fbi reads usenet rec.autos.driving is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles also if you must discuss vs. or radar detectors or insert your pet driving peeve boneheads do it here rec.autos.vw is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen this includes vws audis seats etc it was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful it should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such as a mailing list rec.audio.car is not properly part of the hierarchy it is however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so is mentioned here rec.autos.antique is intended for the discussion of older cars usually more than years old although this is not a hard-and-fast rule alt.hotrod is not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the reader it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles alt.autos.rod-n-custom also not part of the official hierarchy devoted to that peculiar american hobby of customizing older cars alt.autos.karting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics crossposting crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the newsgroups line in the article header such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on usenet you should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience this distinction is subtle but important radar detector articles for example are more-or-less appropriate in they are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is not adequate justification for posting to either group crossposting between any or all of the groups is usually inappropriate if you find yourself doing so consider whether or not it is truly advisable before sending your article consider setting followup-to to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost crossposting between and misc.consumers is chancy at best in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us and/or the use of radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio could n't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups and followup-to lines of articles before posting a followup in particular be wary of posting to misc.test rec.arts.startrek or talk.bizarre or any combination of these three the life you save may be your own distribution there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to partially control where the article goes it is called the distribution field it may be very useful for many reasons it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system the distribution of is fairly extensive as of this writing the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe australia new zealand and some locations in japan with this in mind i offer the following hints about use of the distribution field in your article headers and on article content please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason likes mavericks but only 4-door mavericks at that when posting technical questions please include the market for which your car was manufactured for example there are a number of differences between a european-market ford escort and a us-market escort likewise all 1750cc and early 2000cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel injection european market cars usually got carbs often webers these differences can be important to your readers make your situation clear failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values whereas europe is almost entirely on the metric system a future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that reaches this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it use the distribution field to limit where your article goes when possible within north america the values na north america can canada and usa may be used in addition the two-letter state abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases e.g if i wanted to send an article only to new york and new jersey i could put '' ny nj '' in a distribution field note that multiple comma-separated values are legal these distribution fields vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area the dangers of overgeneralization to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars tires etc what is true for a buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a honda with a 1200cc engine headlight laws in sweden are decidedly different from those in idaho the need for adequate specification when you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information e.g. if you have a question about your honda please specify year model engine size etc otherwise most answers to your question may be quite useless concerning lemons at one time or another every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two even honda admits to this please do n't waste everyone 's time by announcing to the world that your brand x automobile is terrible so all brand x automobiles are terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x company such articles are worse than useless because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information concerning flames as much as we might wish it a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory do n't imagine for a minute that including the words no flames will work it wo n't and you 'll get exactly what you deserve if you 're going to flame you 're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference no one is likely to believe bald unsupported assertions be careful about who you choose to insult consider not insulting anyone asking the question it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please send email i do n't read this group it is a much better idea to end the question with please send email if there is sufficient interest i 'll summarize the results in a later posting i may miss posted responses to this request answering the question if someone wants to hop up their yugo do n't tell them to get a mustang either be silent or give them useful advice if someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket do n't tell them to obey the law next time -- it 's offensive presumes guilt which is not proven and does n't directly address the original question in general do n't post in order to see your words in print and do n't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous stale and/or inflammatory topics certain topics are considered stale by old timers while discussion of them is certainly ok and new factual information is welcome ravings about them are extremely tiresome and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether some topics are naturally inflammatory it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them some of these topics include the following the 55mph speed limit in the us pro and con discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detectors discussions over which radar detector is best discussions over what is a sports car this is one reason why rec.autos.sport is not a sports car group -- everyone would argue about what constitutes a sports car disputes over whether or not us federal law protects the driver's right to own and operate a radar detector buy american discussions clever bumper stickers and personalized license plates
