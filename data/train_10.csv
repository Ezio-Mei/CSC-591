1, darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au fred rice subject re slavery was re why is sex only allowed in marriage ... in 1993apr4.200253.21409 ennews.eas.asu.edu guncer enuxha.eas.asu.edu selim guncer writes you might not like what bernard lewis writes about label him as a zionist or such to discredit him etc you misrepresent me selim the hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book '' orientalism '' by edward said edward said by the way is a christian not a muslim i think he is pretty much objective in his treatment in `` race and slavery in the middle east '' since he clearly distinguishes between slavery under islam and the practice of slavery in other countries like the us prior to the civil war he also does not conceal that there are verses in the quran which promote the liberation of slaves what he does n't and i do n't think nobody can deduce from these verses is that slavery will eventually be abolished in islamic countries now you might rather conveniently blame the practice of slavery on muslims but the facts are out there i also fail to see the relevance of the claim of lewis being a `` zionist '' to what i wrote regarding bernard lewis him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half-truths about islam read `` orientalism '' by edward said -- see the evidence for yourself in fact i may post some of it here if it is n't too long they were encyclopaedic information which anybody can access that slavery was abolished at certain dates some years after muhammed that this was the cause of tensions in the ottoman empire between the arab slave traders and the government etc .. we also have in the asu library volumes of british documents on slavery where reports and documents concerning slavery all around the world can be found which i checked some of the incidents lewis mentions so i do n't think ones political stance has anything to do with documentary evidence i have n't read lewis 's article so i ca n't comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far that his political motives make him a biased writer on islam his anti-islamic polemics as i understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths again read `` orientalism '' by edward said i am _not_ asking you to take what i say on trust in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get this book it is a well-known book and check the evidence out for _yourself_ the issue i raised was that slaves were used for sexual purposes when it was claimed that islam prohibits extra-marital sex i wrote that the prophet himself had concubines i wrote an incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not want his concubine to get pregnant etc. which is contrary to the notion that `` sex is for procreation only '' in other words such claims are baseless in the quran and the hadith if slavery is _in reality_ as opposed to in the practice of some muslims opposed by islam then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too i seem to be unsuccesful in getting through to you islam is not `` advocating '' slavery slavery was an existing institution in the 7th century it advised on slaves being freed for good deeds etc. which is nothing new many cultures saw this as a good thing what is the problem here but i can argue rightfully that slaves were discouraged about thinking about their statuses politically the quran rewards the good slave so obey your master and perhaps one day you 'll be free but it is very understandable that i do not communicate with muslims since they assume the quran is from a `` god '' and i think it is a rule-based system imposed on the society for preservation of the status quo slaves are a part of this system the subordination of women so that their function in society boils down to child-making is a part of this system etc i understand your point of view selim -- i think rather it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_ some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before regarding women i have made posting after posting on this subject showing that islam is not anti-woman etc however have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them i just reposted a very good one under the title `` islam and women '' reposted from soc.religion.islam if this has already disappeared from your site then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this excellent article imho your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient regarding slaves _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one i made which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year -- is based completely on the qur'an and contains numerous qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the qur'an and hadiths now just because people say they are muslims and perform a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is part of islam even if it is opposed by the qur'an and sunnah no of course not let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you the qur'an prohibits drinking now if a person says `` i am a muslim '' and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean that islam teaches that people should drink beer of course not and only an idiot would think so do you see my point it is very natural to think that the author/authors of the quran had no idea that the socio-economic structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm shifts in years in the western cultures first with the end of the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial revolution well rules have changed and the status quo has driven muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a `` heathen '' world muslim countries have failed economically they were unable to accumulate any wealth directly due to the uncomprimising economic rules in the quran in fact the rise of islam can easily be modeled after the pyramid effect you do not produce any wealth at home but increase your wealth by conquering places you are judging islam here on capitalist terms capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist this does not mean that islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it when this stopped you and i were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour no capital no industry very poor social services the education level in muslim countries are the lowest in the world the health statistics are miserable etc .. one can postulate numerous reasons for this your theory is that it is because islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etc selim i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think as you obviously do that islam lack of education and power for a large part of history the islamic world was very powerful for a significant section of history the islamic world was the foremost in the sciences so to say that islam is for example anti-education is completely absurd you try to blame this situation on islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other reasons for this situation you blame muslims for not following the quran but i blame muslims for following the quran well selim your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of islam i really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are following the qur'an or not your idea is baseless from historical facts it is a poor utopia the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow in your theory it is by `` following the qur'an '' that muslims are backwards in education selim it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory while my ideas are derived from social and economic history you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it so far it seems to me that your view on islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history that you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this my solution to all muslims is simple cut the crap i think selim you should consider taking your own advice get the facts straight here too and work hard to reverse the effects of years of ignorance selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of islam but also of islamic history particularly with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about or so i think yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history selim if i remember right you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from islam i think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues and start _reading_ some of our postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have fred rice darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au

12, document_id from smb research.att.com steven bellovin subject clipper chip -- technical details i received the following two notes from martin hellman with details on how clipper will work they are posted with his permission the implications of some details are fascinating -- -- -- date sat apr 23:05:23 pdt from `` martin hellman '' hellman isl.stanford.edu to a long list of recipients subject clipper chip most of you have seen the announcement in friday 's ny times etc about nist national institute of standards technology announcing the `` clipper chip '' crypto device several messges on the net have asked for more technical details and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news articles so here to help out is your friendly nsa link me i was somewhat surprised friday to get a call from the agency which supplied many of the missing details i was told the info was public so here it is the cc of this to dennis branstad at nist is mostly as a double check on my facts since i assume he is aware of all this please let me know if i have anything wrong the clipper chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in silicon each chip will have two secret 80-bit keys one will be the same for all chips ie a system-wide key and the other will be unit specific i do n't know what nist and nsa will call them but i will call them the system key sk and unit key uk in this message the ic will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be kept secret aside it is clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and in my opinion it may be as much for that as this stated purpose the unit key will be generated as the xor of two 80-bit random numbers k1 and k2 uk=k1+k2 which will be kept by the two escrow authorities who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the attorney general but it was stressed to me that they will not be nsa or law enforcement agencies that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased when a law enforcement agency gets a court order they will present it to these two escrow authorities and receive k1 and k2 thereby allowing access to the unit key uk in addition to the system key each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired call this key plain old k. when a message is to be sent it will first be encrypted under k then k will be encrypted under the unit key uk and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key sk producing e e m k e k uk serial number sk when a court order obtains k1 and k2 and thence k the law enforcement agency will use sk to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link aside it is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links with or without a court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow this gives the agency access to e m k e k uk serial number in the above message they then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the `` watch list '' for which they have a court order if so they will decrypt e k uk to obtain k and then decrypt e m k to obtain m. i am still in the process of assessing this scheme so please do not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed scheme all i am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledgably but i will say that the need for just one court order worries me i would feel more comfortable though not necessarily comfortable if two separate court orders were needed one per escrow authority while no explanation is needed the following story adds some color in researching some ideas that silvio micali and i have been kicking around i spoke with gerald gunther the constitutional law expert here at stanford and he related the following story when edward levi became pres ford 's attorney general right after watergate he was visited by an fbi agent asking for `` the wiretap authorizations '' when levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank signed forms every time levi did not comply and changed the system but the lesson is clear no single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps or worse yet divulging of personal keys sometimes he or she will be an edward levi and sometimes a john mitchell martin hellman -- -- date sun apr 11:41:42 pdt from `` martin

sparse in their requesting further info from me or asking for comments on specific questions by this posting i apologize for any messages i am unable to respond to i already spend too much time answering too much e-mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other responsibilities i note a probably correction sent to me by dorothy denning she met with the person from nsa that i talked with by phone so her understanding is likely to better than mine on this point where i said the transmitted info is e e m k e k uk serial number sk she says the message is not double encrypted the system key or family key as she was told it is called only encrypts the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted unit key this is not a major difference but i thought it should be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to my attention it makes more sense since it cuts down on encryption computation overhead

'' model anywhere in christianity song lyrics show your age further since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the usa and many other places and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of scripture we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of `` evil '' i thess 5:22 so this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the conscience of others because back to the beginning ... you are married when you and your intended promise each other and god to be in convenant imo what ch'all think bobby akgua rjb in some states the kind of commitment described in richard szanto's posting can create a common law marriage indeed his posting itself might go a long way towards establishing that a marriage exists should the issue ever end up in court he might want to consult a lawyer who is familiar with common law marriage in his state -- clh

employed sumgait bulk yarn plant resident at building apartment microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan on february my wife and i went to baku to go shopping and returned to sumgait at around five in the evening we ran into one of my relatives at the bus station and got to talking a lot of people had gathered not far away near the store well at first we did n't know what was happening and then a fellow i know comes up to me an azerbaijani guy and says `` what are you standing here for go home immediately '' i asked `` what 's going on '' he says '' what 's the matter ca n't you see they 've overturned a car and they 're killing armenians '' he helped me catch a cab and we got home safely we sat at home for two days during that time a gang of bandits came into our courtyard but the neighbors would n't let them in the building there were about of them they had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands they were shouting something but you could n't understand it it was n't one voice or two all of them were shouting in a chorus they turned toward building they went up to the third _floor and we see that they 're breaking glass and throwing things out the window after a while they come out the entryway one has a pair of jeans in his hands another has a tape recorder and a third a guitar they went on toward the auto parts store we had to save ourselves after midnight on march we went to hide at school no which is in microdistrict there were two other armenian families there with us there were of us altogether out of all of them i had only known ernest before he had moved to sumgait from kirovabad the azerbaijani guard at the school let us in at first he did n't want to but there was nowhere else for us to go we had to plead with him and talk him into it we were told that on that day the 1st there would be an attack on our microdistrict we went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor on the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important i called one of them and the first secretary of the sumgait city party committee answered i asked him for assistance i say `` we 're in school no we need to be evacuated '' well he says `` got it wait there i 'm sending out help now '' i know his voice the first secretary had been to our plant i had spoken with him personally when i called he said `` muslimzade here '' about two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school we looked out the window and about to people were outside saying `` armenians come out we 're here to get you '' they have clubs axes and armature shafts in their hands the guard sat there with us and asked `` where should i go '' i say `` if your life is of any value to you you 'll go down there and say that the armenians were here and that they left '' that 's what he did he went down there and said `` the armenians were here '' he said `` i let them out the back door they went that way '' and pointed with his hand and with shouts and noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed so the assistance we had been promised did come they sent us help all right instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own i am positive that muslimzade did that no one had seen us entering the school no one knew that we were there in any case we stayed at the school until seven in the morning and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid in the morning we went to my relative 's in microdistrict and the soldiers took us to the sk club from there the club was jammed with people and there were lots of people ahead of us -- there was no space available one small boy about three months old died right in my arms there was n't a single doctor nothing the boy was uninjured there were no wounds or bruises on him he was just very ill they gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation they did everything they could under the circumstances but were unable to save him and his mother and father a young armenian couple were right there on the floor ... i searched for a spot for us in the sk we have a small child of our own i wanted to find a room or something to put my family in i went up to the third floor there were a lot of soldiers up there bandaged with canes limping with their heads broken open they were a terrible sight young guys all of them there were a lot of bandaged armenians too everyone had been beaten everyone was crying wailing and calling for help i think that the city party committee ignored us completely true there was a snack bar a sausage was kopeks or kopeks a package of cookies that cost kopeks was being sold for a bottled soft drink cost a ruble but there was no way to get the things any cheaper i met my old uncle aram mikhailovich there he saw
